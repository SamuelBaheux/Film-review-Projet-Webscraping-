[{"comment":"While the animation was decent at best, I felt like the family aspects where lacking, especially when they violently killed the neighbours for having fun. There was way too much gore and foul language and none of the characters had any emotion in their voice, except Pedro. The battle royale sequence was very epic though. I think the Ryan Golsing cameo was sooo good! This brings up the score to 5 stars\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udde3\ud83e\udef6\ud83d\udc79."},{"comment":"Very cute movie!
