James Cameron is on a roll, an epic one at that."},{"comment":"Ofcourse I still love the original more, but this didn't disappoint. Watching in 4dx was cool but the smell was a bit odd."},{"comment":"a not so unpredictable action sci fi flick, based on the first installment, and with an environmental message that whaling is a bad thing. Nice shots, nice scenery and great sfx effects, but my god this movie could have been 60 min shorter and it still would be the same as it is now, just a little less boring"},{"comment":"Avatar movies are so amazing\nSuch a beautiful story line \nYou really fall in love with the characters\nAnd the action scenes are insane\nIt keeps you on the edge of your seat\nI hope they keep making these because I'll keep watching!! Over and over again"},{"comment":"The movie was beautiful for me, but I must admit that it is very flat, its story has no development and its characters are not developed enough for a 3-hour movie, but the effects and CGI have improved so much that it makes you want to be in that fantasy."},{"comment":"This movie brought nothing new. The first one brought us to this new world and it was amazing. The writing is just bad."},{"comment":"A \"subtle-as-a-sledgehammer\" soulless husk of a movie wrapped in some of the finest visual effects the world has ever seen. In the moments where the inner nerd in me was not geeking out at the technical prowess of the visuals, the story bored me to tears. It honestly feels like it was written by an AI, totally absent anything worth investing in.\n\nPerhaps I am overly harsh as there is nothing outright offensive about this movie, but given the cultural significance of the Avatar movies, I cannot help but hold them to the highest standards. Unfortunately, this standard is one neither Avatar nor Avatar 2 can meet."},{"comment":"Every movie has it downsides but it is refreshing to see a story that was not mangled by Disney decease. Yes, it was maybe made under the studios of Disney and it is on Disney+ but James Cameron seemed to have the last word here.\n\nIt is not the best movie ever made and is not the most original story ever. It is not doing everything right, duh...\nThere are multiple plot paths an scenes that were just retold from the first movie.\nDespite the incredible length of the movie the depth of the characters was seemingly not fully shown. (But it seems there is much more).\nThe choice of the main anthagonistis is kind of kind of lazy and feels like a cliche.\n\nBUT\n\nBesides offering the best visuals in our time I cared for the characters and was invested. \nEmotions and a fantastic world immersion are the focus of this movie while ramping up the conflict from the first movie because it was clear we will see the humans come back after the first movie. \n\nIn my opinion Avatar (2): Way of the water is scoring with something I haven't seen much. There is a lot of communication ONLY through body language and fine and subtle facial expressions which is proving the priceless value of the awesome actors behind the CGI mask. The technology of the first movie was improved immensely so it is sometimes hard not to believe that these are not real creatues because the acting of the real actors is transfered very acurately\n\nCompared to many other movies in the last years I think this one was made with passion. Also because I saw the making-of which at least gave me the impression the actors seem to have fun."},{"comment":"I was bored with this tbh. The first one was a derivative story to be sure, we'd seen the same set up a million times before, but the setting and the technology and the heart stood it slightly above the rest and you had to take notice. This one was disappointing. Tropes in movies like this where the main characters all make obvious and idiotic, incorrect decisions to push the plot along, such as the kids in the story constantly being caught and used as bait or used to bargain with the main characters, gets tedious pretty quick and the whole end sequence lacks any actual interesting action because the main battle seems to happen off screen and they utterly forget about it. There were a number of other plot issues I had with this one but generally speaking the sheen has kind of worn off and the stale story and bland characters makes it really hard to recommend. Best bet would be to see the first and forget this one exists."},{"comment":"It's not James Cameron's fault. If I were paid a boatload of money to make an absolute piece of trash film, I would do it too. It's the viewer who is to blame.

This sequel isn't anything special. In fact, it's less special than the original because there doesn't seem to have been any improvement in the visual effects since 2009. Also, The Way of Water is so long that my fingers started getting pruney near the end. They could have cut at least two of the excessive storylines.

The only problems I had with it were the throwbacks to the original movie. Asking if this is how it is done when making a video diary for the main villain. Like a baby!

I hope that James Cameron can stay ahead of the tech for round 3."},{"comment":"Very overrated\u2026.. and i don't say that lightly. The plot is genuinely blue aliens riding on water dragons shooting spaceships with machine guns for two hours. The big fight scene lasted for an hour and was not very enjoyable. It's so lacking in originality that the villain from the first movie was (basically) brought back to life because they could not think of a new one.

And then even when the story is predictable and subpar, it's okay because it looks good. \n\nJust another way to say all that glitters isn't gold."},{"comment":"The main character's (Sully) growth as a person in the first movie was completely set back in this one. He became some sexist nuclear dad \"leader\" type who is rude to his wife and does not respect his children. Nobody calls him out for this in the movie either. He is unlikeable, selfish, and has zero character growth in this movie.\nThey completely ruined Neytiri as a character. She is made so unimportant and soulless in this movie. Everything that made her an impressive and likeable character is gone. It was especially, disappointing to see the last scene where Sully, who has been a horrible dad the whole movie, gets to have an emotional moment with his deceased son and Neytiri just looks from a distance. Just complete disrespect to her as a mother and the way more spiritual and in touch person she was in the first movie.\nAlso, it is such lazy writing to just bring the same villain back from the last movie. Really boring.\nThe story is full of plot holes as well. Especially the adopted daughter's birth is so random. She is a bit overpowered, and it is not explained whatsoever why this is.\nThe young daughter, Tuk, has no point in the story. They could have completely left her out, and it wouldn't have mattered. It just makes the whole story more messy and dump.\nAlso; Why does the Spider character believe the sky people have any good intentions in the first place?! And then he saves the villain?! FOR WHAT??!! NOTHING of his thought process is explained!\nOverall I am very disappointed. I really liked the first movie because it gave an interesting view on imperialism\/colonialism that we don't often see in big blockbuster movies. I hoped this movie could show us something about post-colonialism or something, but unfortunately that is not the route the makers chose to take.

Plot was extremely predictable and had many logical holes, like where did the Metkayina tribe go the entire last hour of the film? I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters because they weren't fleshed out enough.\nOne extreme problem I had with this movie was Lo'ak, who consistently gave the movie plot armor to continue, he made several horror movie-esque tropes of poor decision making, static characters in movies are really boring. He didn't have the defiant teenager attitude that he was made to be, but was more a deadweight to the family. \nFor a movie that took a decade to make you'd think the plot would be on par with its visuals."},{"comment":"Needed to watch a 2nd time to get the correct Impact it deserves. \nIts hard to describe how much its effect on my Emotions you really do need to put down everything and sit take it all in then come out the otherside knowing you have watched a Really Really Great Film."},{"comment":"Visually stunning but the story was too light and spread too thin for it's over 3 hour length."},{"comment":"It has its good points, visually its great but it's mostly just passable.  Also after over a decade who cared about sequel in the first place?  The story had a lot of holes, a lot of things didn't make sense, and there were a few downright contradictions.  But overall it was fine"},{"comment":"When industrially innovative pioneers enlarged photos into motion, they gave birth to cinema with endless inspirations and aspirations provoking visionary creativities. The filmmaking productions started becoming more dimensional as the platform continuously evolves, pushing the cinematic envelope on what is possible in adapting our inner imaginations to life, even those that we may not share which therefore requires the storytelling to be coherently sensible so we can collectively join in grasped amazement. Similar to the question on where could have Walt Disney took his company if he was alive today, where would those pioneers take us if they personally guided the film form rather at spiritual distance? We see those traces through James Cameron's innovative filmmaking practiced through \"Aliens\" and \"The Abyss\" then fully realized by creative definition in \"Titanic\" carried into \"Avatar\", becoming most distinctive blockbusters that inspired towards inferiority. From \"The Terminator\" to its acclaimed sequel among those other films along with \"True Lies\", he [officially] made a name for himself in the film industry with ambitious scopes aimed to surpass each other with promising experiences to transcend in equal fashion. His elemental ambitions accumulated in his tenth directorial project, third time with full command and the start of a multi-film project with evolved passion, goes back into the world of Pandora in \"Avatar: The Way of Water\".\n\nThe keyword behind the production is patience, not the anticipation since the 2009 phenomenon but the notion of art not being rushed, and meeting demands when the artist took time in engrossing himself with the potential he created and how he could explore it. Given release dates before postponing every few years due to needed technology not yet developed to support the planned innovation in fully realizing the story's expansive worldbuilding. Rewrites did not quite grasp the aimed perfection because the next chapter will have to be transportive to lengths we have not seen before by their standards. Cameron first penned \"Avatar\" in the 1990s but been shelved till it is technologically opportune, releasing 12 years after his triumphant but overbearing \"Titanic\". \"The Way of Water\" released 13 years later after the huge success that replicated, even surpassed the records made by his previous epic, and it seems another round reoccurred amidst the changed cinematic landscape aligned with the next generational interest. However, the first creative hiatus was conceptualizing the worldbuilding, then the next that nurtured this phenomenal repeat similarly waited but also furthered the excelled worldbuilding into mapping across multiple chapters now slated (for now) to end in 2031. The four sequels will be released under normal fashion akin to typical span, sadly will not open with a return scenic trip on the breathtaking sights of Pandora after so long that welcomed us back into this next chapter (almost like we never left).\n\nWith the bar raised and the timespan in between, there were understandably hints of doubt on how the sequel could re-capture its high-ranking, original predecessor's success, especially considering the changed landscape wavering interest opting for a shrunken experience. Putting all that in retrospect adjacent to the obscured behind the scenes progresses with only spoken glimpses provided as updates, it comes understatedly surprising upon the final product finally unveiled and agreeing to the consensus that it is genuinely worth the wait. Once again, James Cameron proven himself in another triumph as the sequel turned out equally great. Not greater nor better, just as (akin to \"Black Panther\" and \"Wakanda Forever\"). The trailers' glimpses are what they are without true justice to the fuller impacts when connecting with the characters as we diegetically react to the imagined wonders. While the returning backdrop remains transfixing, interactively trekked in tune to a great picture, the sequel's main element is water with expected immersion exceptionally achieved that does not break the beautifully astonishing core of the growing, or glowing, franchise. This particular exploration enables underwater acting, the steps Cameron needed in order to fully flesh out his impeccable vision and probably to finally get on with the sequels (especially after this sequel's certifiable success). This results in his majestic accumulation of his directorial filmography: aquatically by \"The Abyss\", romantically and structurally by \"Titanic\" with \"Aliens\" in particular to the latter, and thematically by his \"Terminator\" installments.\n\nWith the pre-established narrative and yet seen wonders, the perfectly-written chapter, and maybe same goes for the forthcoming ones, is a thematic portrait by reasonable thoughtful space towards the story and characterized depths. \"Avatar\" shared the themes expressed between the 90s animated fares \"Ferngully: The Last Rainforest\" with strong environmental messaging and \"Pocahontas\" on human cruel relationships against nature by colonialism, the latter being Cameron's source of inspiration for this overarching story split into two significant effects serving their fundamental purposes. One is family that defines the main characters' motivated strengths to spiritual connective extents such as Lo'ak empathetically bonding with a wrongly outcasted creature, Kiri grappling with spiritualism secondarily regarding her identity, and Spider reluctantly bonding with his antagonistically reborn father learning the Na'vi way.\n\nThe familial resonance here is more emotionally engaging and wholesomely felt upon their dynamics that are pure and realistic in certain cases, gracefully enriched by the peaked performances with evolved statures and blossomed heart through their emotional convictions. The pivotal cast from the original are set to return across the sequels, mostly filmed back-to-back so the younger bloods can maintain their characters' ages closely. Sam Worthington approached his character's return with seriousness per the normal gravitational focus priorities pressurized, which goes the same for Zoe Saldana now that both their characters are parents looking out for their family from the returning dangers they barely stand a chance against, especially how knowledgeable the former still is. Sigourney Weaver returns as a different character that spawned from her own, digitally de-aged per design, convincingly channeled down to her younger self quite capably that gifts her character Kiri with an appealing personality and compelling arc. Stephen Lang proclaimed himself to Darth Vader's height by villainous comparison as he cannot be killed despite what happened previously, but his return is seamless and ethical with malevolence and apparent cracks. Joining the tribe are Kate Winslet and Cliff Curtis as the oceanic clan's chiefs, respectively bringing in fiery distrust, motherly protective heart and grittily coded honor. The younger cast \u2013 Jamie Flatters (Neteyam), Britain Dalton (Lo'ak), Trinity Jo-Li Bliss (Tuk) and Jack Champion (Spider) \u2013 may seem they are another case like most sequels weighing on the next generation that lays the story onto their shoulders. If that is so, which feels almost half, they carried the film outstandingly with energetically nuanced, relatedly and emotionally resonating performances as we get attached to their respective wondrous journeys and grits adjacent to their parental protections. This is collectively their mainstream breakthrough by solidifying recognition."},{"comment":"The premise of the story felt cliche. There was a lot of attention to detail which you will notice.

Good overall message about family, and pretty entertaining movie. I'd recommend."},{"comment":"You get from this what you get from the first Avatar. An absolutely stunning visual spectacle and a story you never think about again once you've left he cinema.\nThe characters and story are serviceable enough to keep you entertained while admiring Pandora, the action sequences did drag in places but are still James Cameron action scenes, so still competent. \nAs much as James Cameron liked to brag about his female characters in this, all of them except Neytiri had no action prowess and one of them managed to get kidnapped and rescued 3 times in one action sequence, surpassing anything Princess Peach ever achieved. So don't expect anything on that front.\nOn the whole I liked the first one a lot more, but this is serviceable. If you liked the first one enough to see all of these blue movies, you won't be disappointed. The plot and characters were never the draw, so if you liked the world of Pandora and want a pretty world to look at for a couple of hours, then this will do."},{"comment":"Oh, wow. I found it hard to make it through this one. If you want a pretty screensaver, this movie is it. Other than that, it has one of the worst plots I've ever seen. Character actions just don't make any sense. I found myself laughing at this movie way more than I expected, and I don't think it's a comedy. So unless the goal was to teach writers what not to do, I'm not really sure what was going on. James Cameron has had some amazing films in his day; I was willing to look past the first Avatar movie (which suffered similar writing flaws and plot holes), because it was at least slightly original (dances with wolves in space) and had a bit of heart. This felt like a cash-grab. Recycled plot, villains, and no nuance to anything. The themes were shoved in your face so hard that it was almost insulting. I'm sure some will enjoy it because it's pretty (it is gorgeous to look at), but it's just so hollow. I would much rather watch an episode of Blue Planet."},{"comment":"I won't lie, I saw this when it first came out but just writing a review now. I am not proud to say this but I LOVED this movie.

This causes them to follow the angry leader and be just too enlightened to give a movie like Avatar 2, which was so hyped, a good review.  This movie is fantastic!  It is an unbelievable testament to the technology available today AND the story is absolutely fantastic.  Those characteristics alone are the recipe of disdain for the smug, wannabe intellectual, film critic."},{"comment":"Finally the long awaited sequel to Avatar is here, and i have mixed feelings.\nFirst of all I had little to no expectations for this film, but I was really curious on how it was gonna turn out to be. Before I bash on the film let me first state the things that I liked about the movie.\nTHE VISUALS AND THE CINEMATOGRAPHY. The film is a feast for the eyes, I couldn't keep my eyes off the big screen, especially the underwater sequences are so beautiful. Not just the water but the forest sequences looked really marvelous too. There is no doubt on the fact that this film is gonna win the academy award for best visual effects this year, besides it's not like it has great competition either.\nMoving on to the characters, the only character that I loved was the Tulkan, I forgot his name , but I absolutely loved him. He was really adorable and the relationship shared between that Tulkan and Jake's son is really sweet, it reminded me of the relation that I shared with my pet.\nEnough of positives, now let's move on to the negatives. First of all the plot, it felt like James Cameron just forgot about the plot and decided to just rely on the underwater sequences, which made it look like a segment from National Geographic. I understand that James wanted to focus on the world building , and I respect that, but it was too excessive. He could've cut down on the number of sequels too, at least in my opinion.\nThe main evil of this film, the characters. I can't remember the last time I felt so detached from the characters, because I didn't root for a single character nor did I care for their existence. The motivations of the antagonist(s) weren't fleshed out properly in my opinion.\nOne more thing about this film is that it is over ambitious, it tries to be so many things at the same time. It looks like a teenage drama, a bad ass action film, and the first film itself? This made the film kind of unbearable and I felt nothing while watching the film.\nIn conclusion, Avatar: The way of the water is the case of style over substance which had a lot of potential. But all i can say for now is , let's wait for the sequels."},{"comment":"Terrible script ruined a visually brilliant film.

In an effort to be relatable to kids, they ruined a unique position for the avatar family.\n- The main enemy from Avatar 1, relives again!!! why cant bad guys just die and stay dead!!\n\nThis was not worth the 3 hours."},{"comment":"Good movie until near the end epic battle between the 2 main characters good guy wins by choking him under the sea, later much later, a supporting character finds the dead guy at the bottom of the ocean swims him back to the surface dead guy revived, lives?

I can't really stress enough how much effort it looks like they put into the CGI - it really looks good.  It has, I guess, a positive message about protecting your family.

The human 'troops' are worse than incompetent - worse than Stormtroopers... worse than the Aliens from Independence Day - I was embarrassed for them, and they presented zero threat.  And this film is WAY too long.  the final battle was like 30 minutes too long and they wasted a TON of time doing Jacques Cousteau stuff.

Britain Daltons Lo'ak is incredible, as are all of the sons and daughters in the movie. Edie Falco and Cliff Curtis also leave strong impressions in their small roles. I am SO excited for Avatar 3!

Except its 3:00 long!"},{"comment":"This film should be renamed Avatar: The Way to Waste Your Time Bro!!!\n\nThis film is an utter joke!\n\nSure it looks cool, but not that much more impressive than the first movie.\n\nThis is the plot as far as i can tell.\n\nIt is many years since the first movie and Jake and Neytiri have 3 kids including adopting Grace Augastine's child Kiri, which her Avatar gave birth to somehow with no explination and no follow up.\n\nThere is also a teen called Spider who is the son of Quaritch the villain fron the first movie. Spider seems to have no consistent motives, beliefs or character development throughout the entire movie. Especially after being torutured and resiting he is seen cheerfully helping the villains learn how to fly dragons and then is later shocked that the villians are treating villages brutally to find out where Jake is.\n\nThey bring back Quaritch as the main villian again which was a pretty poor move considering he wasn't even a solid villain in the first movie and failed to stop Jake the last time and was killed by Neytiri. In this movie the humans have spent their time and money to bring back as a Na'vi the man who failed spectacularly last time, to go on a mission to stop Jake again which he fails to do once again.\n\nAfter Jake saves his kids from Quaritch and just leaves Spider to be kidknapped by the guy he defeated last time, Jake decides he has to resign as chief and leader of the resistance and he has to leave with his family beacuse he can't beat the guy him and his wife single handley defeated in the last movie.\n\nThere is no mention here of the resistance which, we can assume never proceeded further and thus there would be no reason to track down Jake since he is no longer a threat. But still Quaritch decides to anyway, with no clear object in mind but soley to \"catch Jake.\"\n\nThe next big chunk of the movie is like an ocean nature documentary mixed with Jake's family assimilting to the water tribe and the kids saying \"bro\" and \"cuz\" every sentence while they go through scenes of cliched teenage angst and Jake blandly lecturing them to no avail.\n\nKiri for no good reason can now hold her breath underwater indefinitely, and can connect and control sealife and no one seems to notice or care until she randomly has a sezuire and is told not to do it again or shell die and then she does it again and is completley fine.\n\nLo'ak befreinds a whale as a result of a backfired teenage prank and then is told that he shouldn't be friends with that whale because its an outcast due to it fighting back in self defense when its family of whales was attacked.\n\nQuaritch then joins a group of whale hunters to help him kill a whale in the hopes that for some bizzare reason Jake would care or even somehow know about it.\n\nThe whale hunters mention as a side note that they harvest the whales brain juice beacause its stops peopls from aging and that is why peole came back to the planet. This is never mentioned again.\n\nAnyways, they kill a whale and the ocean clan are not happy and Quaritch captures some of Jake's kids. They start a fight and once the whale that is Lo'ak's friend comes to help the ocean clan vanishes from screen without a trace.\n\nJake and his family fight Quaritch in a Titanic like sinking boat scene where everyone is suddenly afraid to jump into the water and just swim away. Instead they spend ages swiming through many tunnels and get trapped. Jake ends up choking Quaritch and he sinks into the ocean but Spider goes and saves him and then hisses at him and abandons him on a rock.\n\nThen everyone says \"I see you\" a few times because it's the franchise catchphrase for no good reason.\n\nBro, this so called story easily could have fit easily into a one and a half hour film!\n\nI dont understand how many years after the first film they still couldn't write an original or engaing story. This may have well been a nature documentary. Just chuck David Attenborough's voice over instead of Jakes continually coming in to say abstolutley nothing of value.\n\nJames Cameron, congratulations on duping the masses again and making an absolute boat load of cash at the box office.

In The Way of Water, they seemed to have zero original ideas, re-hashing all the same concepts\/dialogue\/storylines\/characters as the original. Same bad guy too. Well, a clone of the bad guy. Come on. You had 13 years, and this is the best you could come up with. They also took that last 20-30 minutes of mind-numbing action from '09 Avatar and expanded it to take up most of the movie. The story \"logic\" made zero sense. Why the hell did the sky people come back? I guess they don't give a damn about unobtanium any more. But now they need magic whale brain juice. And to get revenge on Jake Sully. Ridiculous. I stopped watching with maybe 30 minutes left, and stopped caring about the why and how regarding the story long before that. I've never written a Rotten Tomatoes review, but I was so disappointed and angry about this movie I felt I needed to write this. 92% positive audience reviews??

The character consistency on top of that was not ideal with Jake, the man who dreams of flying, the man who rode Tar'uk immediately giving that up.  They reduced Neyteiri's character to her flow of tears.  It's beautiful but beauty isn't everything."},{"comment":"Yes the visual was impressive but the plot... so shallow it is difficult to watch. We have an civilization from a different galaxy and yet the teenagers behaved like a typical American families. You can't have lesser imagination than that. We have technology that travel thru galaxy and yet the war machine looks so similar to current state. You want something really futuristic just take a look at Dune. The plot is no different from early American invading the native land except the new arrival destroyed the whole native civilization.

I literally felt like I was there. It's what a 3-D movie should be like.  It should transport you and it did!  I love how much of the movie.  The story was more balanced than the first Avatar movie, but the graphics were much better.  There was much more time spent being able to see and actually experience the world of Pandora instead of that being a short section of the movie.  And there was less time for all the combat and action which is far to excessively abundant in so many new movies today.  So it was refreshing to be able to follow a detailed story instead of sitting through just egregious action scenes."},{"comment":"Ugh. This movie had an absolutely pointless plot. There was simply no reason to go to the water other than to give an excuse to show that part of Pandora. Do the writers not know how to write a plot? Ugh. It was so painful. Other things were painful too, and they didn't bother to explain them either. Apparently Pandora has something else that isn't Unobtanium from their tree that is great fuel and is instead something from some creature's brain that can make people live forever, or stop ageing, or something. Ugh. But it was beautiful. If they spent half of the amount of time they spent on the visuals on the plot then this could have been a really good movie, but, after we saw an awful plot in the first Avatar movie, were we really surprised? Just having them reinvent the term \"Avatar\" was probably a hint as to how bad this was going to be. Bad, bad, bad. But beautiful. So if you are someone who loves a beautiful movie and doesn't care about the plot, then this is the movie for you. It was probably really great at the movies in 3-D. I actually think it was worse than the first movie as it made even less sense, and surely we aren't that impressed by glorious cinematics now, are we? Well, given that this is now the 3rd-highest-grossing movie of all-time, behind just Avatar and Avengers Endgame, perhaps we haven't got sick of beautiful cinematics. This was painful to watch. I gave it 0\/10 for the plot but the beauty has to mean something so I gave it 2\/10."},{"comment":"People waited 20 years for the same movie, only under water.

This period of peace doesn't last long due to the return of a familiar enemy of Jake's. The family now has to move to a different region where they have to learn to fit in, and learn the way of water. As disaster and surprise continues to strike, Jake is given the task of defeating his enemies in order to save himself, his family, and his people. \n\nAvatar: The Way of Water is a dynamic, engaging story perfect for a night at the movies. It is a long movie, running three hours and twelve minutes; some scenes where Jake and his family are learning the ways of the Metkayina feel too long and they overpower the villain subplot. However, the scenes aren't anti-climactic, so they held my attention. The CGI in Avatar: The Way of Water stands out from the minute the film begins. The characters have high quality, unique features, and the underwater scenes and animals are astonishing. The ground-breaking new CGI techniques used give it a fantastical tone that is distinct from other films. I love the representation of a sibling bond. Neteyam (Jamie Flatters), Lo'ak (Britain Dalton), Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li) and even Spider (Jake Champion) don't always get along. However, when it comes down to a life or death situation, protecting one another is always the most important. These relationships have the power to make the audience laugh and cry.\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water carries the message that family is everything, whether they are related by blood or not. Jake clearly cares about his biological children and is willing to do anything for them. But even with Kiri, Spider and both the Na'vi and Metkayina people, you see his protective nature and the protective nature the family has over each other.\n\nI give Avatar: The Way of Water 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.  By Maica N., KIDS FIRST!"},{"comment":"Look you watched the first, so you're gunna watch this one, and you'll watch the next two (way of earth, and then way of fire).

The dichotomy between the Jungle Na'vi and the Water Na'vi was amazing submerging both cultures showing how wide the avatar world is.

Then not only do you leave all your people behind you then call in your buddies to not help your daughter when you know full well there are Na'vi (The Metkayina) already there, with supernatural powers, that can help. Wouldn't you at least ask the healer of the tribe first. This movie is terrible and rotten to the core. I do like Pandora and the Na'vi' tribes but the story is atrocious."},{"comment":"I was incredibly happy with the portrayal of Jake Sully as a father and husband. You don't see it often anymore.... a strong father. Together Neytiri and Jake are a power couple -- truest form I've ever seen. My hope is that they continue this throughout the remainder of the series and not make the father\/husband figure weaker and weaker. The story was inspiring because of the family bond and because of the bond between Jake and Neytiri-- they know their roles and respect and honor them. It's a controversial topic but I don't believe it crossed the line. It stays true to a culture like the Na'vi's and it honestly was refreshing see what was portrayed in this film. Good examples of love and respect and dignity. Taking pride in one's family and culture is important and I believe lost in todays society. To say this movie was refreshing would be an understatement."},{"comment":"Owing to Cameron's proud history of amazing sequels (T2, Aliens), I had high hopes for Way of Water.  But..nope.  Not bad.

Acting was almost theatrical with the terrible comic book style dialogue written for this moving. The characters are constantly acting out of their personalities, and nothing ever is explored deeply. Characters were giving snippets of something that seemed to be an important step in the film just to never have them revisited or their importance only added time to the outrageously long film that accomplished nothing.

Watching it in 3D was a wholey different experience than any other 3D movie I have seen. So visually stunning that you are transported from the theater to an epic new part of Camerons universe, which in my opinion is what movies are about. A suspension of reality for a few hrs of fun and time to disconnect. The plot was great. Has a whole generational aspect to the story that builds on a lineage already created by the first film.  There was action, emotion, and humor. The three pillars of a good film in my opinion. Some say that it was too similar to the first movie, just with new locations. I disagree I think that the movie was a natural continuation of the first. Also, as alien as the film is there are so many real world tropes that put a light on real world issues from our history and from today. Which gives the film a great deal of introspection. As with any trilogy it leaves so many things up in the air and obviously there was no resolution to the story as there is still more to come. My family and I cannot wait for the next film. Definitely worth watching, and not only once I mind you but again."},{"comment":"It is way too long and slow. Too much filler. Avatar 2 feels like a special effects show off. \n\nOh yeah, the plot.

Now granted, this movie doesn't break ground on any new concepts or ideas in storytelling but it does however succeed in its aim.  Which is to be an rollercoaster ride leaning heavily on its VFX to carry the story, and its does so accordingly.

It shows us more of Pandora, continuing familiar themes of life, death, and renewal as well as the jaw dropping visuals we have come to expect. And the plot, while some may is predictable, is entirely believable. What did you expect, that human greed and irreverence would make way for a different for?\n\nPerhaps other reviews slating the predictable plot, or shallow characters, or long runtime are valid... from the point of view of a casual watcher, or a 'seen it all before' critic, or a fantasy cynic.\nBut from a heartfelt Avatar fanatic, James Cameron should not change the Avatar formula in the slightest"},{"comment":"This movie was wonderful and you get so lost in the world feeling that it is real,  that the brutality shown to the animals in this film was hard to watch."},{"comment":"Poetic and necessary at a time of denialism about climate causes and apathy."},{"comment":"The first was Dances with Wolves IN SPACE.

The plot line is abysmally boring and lacking in imagination and harkens back to cheap sci-fi antics for bringing back fallen characters.

Very very good performance from the leading cast here (Zie Saldana (Neytiri) is most impressive here. \n\nMy only issue was with the pacing midway into the movie as it made the experience feel like two movies with the change of tone.

The visuals are amazing and it's so real. The only reason why I am not giving it a 5 star is because there were certain things in the story that I was not ok with. \n\n1. Lo'ak's childish and selfish teenager attitude that literally caused the main sources of family tragedies in the whole movie.

It revisits Pandora and expands its world by adding new characters. The cinematography is so beautiful. James Cameron hasn't lost his touch when it comes to directing great action adventure movies. The ensemble cast is amazing as well, which is composed of actors from Cameron's previous hit movies. Some elements in the movie also reminded me of Cameron's previous movies like Aliens, The Abyss and Titanic. It's amazing to know that the cast had to shoot underwater scenes for motion capture. It is also interesting to know that nearly all of the water in the film is computer-generated.  Acting, direction, set design and editing were all good. Sequels usually have a hard time living up to its predecessor, but this film is almost as good as the first. The pacing is good enough that you wouldn't feel that movie was 3 hours long, although I think it might help if the movie would be trimmed a bit to be more concise. The movie is epic with lots of battle scenes.  It's so spectacular and the stunning visuals make it quite an experience to watch."},{"comment":"WTF is this?

However, once the family is in their new home, the story begins to captivate.\n\nI feel that Cameron and team missed an opportunity to make the first half as adventuresome in it's narrative as the second half. There are hints and glimpses but instead becomes a stubborn narrative forced upon the audience. For a 3+ hour long movie there also seem to be a lot of loose ends, subplots that felt rushed together rather than vetted out and eventually resolved or successfully punted down the story line.\n\nThe original Avatar movie is one I can watch over and over again, it seems like there was the potential for that with the sequel however it is missing the stickiness of the first film but still entertaining and at the end achieves a few emotional tear jerk moments."},{"comment":"Seeing the best visually stunning for 3 hours is worth 5 stars"},{"comment":"So terrible.

Then, they decided to bring back the key characters they killed off in the first film, oh and give one of them a kid as well.

It is a remarkable achievement in alot of ways that this is an easy 3 12 hour watch. Easy, fun and sometimes emotional and of course very cool to look at. You are submerged in that world of Pandora and its alot of fun. Some of it could be kind of corny but those parts are still enjoyable.

Sigourney Weaver's character connecting so much to Eywa resonated so much with real religious beliefs of mother earth and the na'vi s beliefs. I personally resonated with it so much. The film as a whole had drama, action, romance, family bonds and clearly had an incredible amount of effort put in to make it. Left on a very cool cliffhanger so I'm hopeful there will be a third movie eventually, perhaps sticking with the elemental theme considering the first was resonating with Earth and Air, the second with Water, so finally maybe Fire and some more Spirit??\ud83e\udd70 I'm a true fan of the movies, saw the first when it was in cinema and saw the second on disney+ as soon as it was released. \nFingers crossed it does well enough for a third movie!!\ud83d\udc97"},{"comment":"Predictable, hackneyed \"humans bad\" plot.

But besides that, the movie offers some of the most incredible visuals seen in a movie to date both under and above water. The story at its center dives deep into the meaning and importance of family and fatherhood which is developed incredibly well throughout the movie 3 hour and 15-minute run time. The cast is great whether it's the returning stars like Sam Worthington and Zoe Salda\u00f1a or some of the new actors each one doing a great job in playing their part in conveying the overall story of the film.

Moreover, even though the special effects are really good, it seems to be less surprising than the first movie. Also, I am not sure if special effects are groundbreaking at all.

Of course there are some negatives but it's not enough to bring down the movie from my 5 star rating along with EEAAO this year. The story is simple but also has a meaningful message. The movie starts of in the forest with the Omaticaya people and goes on to the Metkayina people and of course the people we follow along the way such as of course Jake, Neytiri, Lo'ak, Neteyam, Tuktirey and Kiri as the Sully family and of course other characters such as Spider, Tsireya, Ao'nung, Tonowari and Ronal. And the returning villain Colonel Miles Quaritch as a Na'vi.\n\nThe relationship between the brothers which are Lo'ak and Neteyam were amazing and they get in trouble with their parents and even the head\/chief of the Metkayina that perfectly leads to the emotional death of Neteyam caused by some RDA soldiers. I really think they could build a stronger relationship on screen with Lo'ak and Neteyam but it's really emotional. Kiri is really mysterious and maybe in the future we'll learn more about Kiri's special connection with Eywa.

Story tropes are repeated both from the first movie in predictable fashion but also repeatedly throughout the movie itself and can leave you annoyingly bored less than halfway through the way-too-long duration of the film. But what shocked me most is that after all these years, the facial effects of the animated characters seems noticeably less believable than they did in the first movie - some characters are attempting to puppet emotional responses on their faces but they just don't pull it off, which can totally take you out of an already dry movie. \n\nThe only thing I'll say is that I didn't see this movie in 3D. Do I think there's a problem if you have to see a movie in 3D in order to be able to appreciate it? Yup. Might it lead to you getting more out of it than I did? Quite possibly."},{"comment":"The much-awaited sequel to 2009's epic sci-fi film redefines the second chapter that marks the triumphant return from a visionary filmmaker James Cameron.

Despite its impressive visuals, Avatar 2 leaves a lot to be desired and reminds us that special effects alone cannot compensate for poor story and character development."},{"comment":"it's by no means any masterpiece. The CGI is good but nothing groundbreaking, the tech is just too good these and there is nothing in this movie that goes beyond anything we would have seen in other movies. The story is kind of bland without any surprises and while there is an attempt to make it deep with the traditional dilemma of exploitation of natural resources for profit, it has been done before and this iteration is not that great. It is good family-friendly entertainment and mostly surfs on the hype of being the second iteration of the high-grossing movie of all time which is the key marketing argument to go watch the movie in theatres."},{"comment":"It manages to recapture the visual majesty of the first instalment, reminding us how spectacular Pandora looks. It might not innovate enormously in terms of treading familiar lines as many revenge sequels, but it does so with confidence and style. It might have been 'better' to commit to a cleaner, fresher story, but it really doesn't do the franchise a disservice by playing out a traditional plot. It's a lovely cast, visually rich and a delight to be back on Pandora after so long.

After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.\n\nAs someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.\n\nFirst of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.\n\nVisually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes."},{"comment":"Loved it can't wait for number 3"},{"comment":"This film is visually perfect and wonderfully made, but the story is so boring, predictable and irrelevant that it ends up being something very difficult to watch 3 hours of this without wishing it please end."},{"comment":"Excellent.

The Way of Water follows the same narrative structure as its predecessor but significantly improves upon its visual effects. The genius minds at Weta have genuinely outdone themselves by enhancing motion capture technology to the point where the line between reality and CGI is blurred. The story picks up where the first Avatar movie left off, which is reasonable considering it was released 13 years prior. While James Cameron expands the world of Pandora and charters new territory, the characters remain the same and don't undergo any actual development after a hefty runtime of over 3 hours. Nevertheless, Avatar: The Way of Water is well worth watching, if only for being a visual spectacle and one of the most immersive movie experiences in recent years."},{"comment":"\u2022nothing to say this movie is just good"},{"comment":"There isNothing negative to say at all about this movie."},{"comment":"Visually stunning, yes.

As a sequel to Avatar, this movie also tries to tell us the environmental issues but as the title says, Avatar: The Way of Water, here aquatic issues. The whale hunting scene of the movie clearly depicts how man-made activities have been cruel to the aquatic organisms. Literally felt the feelings of the whale. The movie is bit lengthy but the visuals along with the story let's you throughout. Hats off to the director for creating this picture. Well, don't miss to immerse in the experience of Avatar: The Way of Water in theatres."},{"comment":"I like nature and the fact of experiencing a sensation of total realism from a screen to my chair. But the wait for AVATAR THE WATER PATH is summed up in a very generic and flat story, which I feel traces some achievements of its predecessor, being an adventure instead of on land, in the water and with humans being \"again\" the \"enemies of heaven\" and the \"true hostiles\" of history. If James Cameron wants to engage us more with this universe in the making, he must tell us a story that does more than fill his pockets with tons of money. My rating is 3.8 out of 5.

Also it had dynamic, even fierce female characters with their own motives.\nThis sequel stinks of Orientalism and sexism. From the criticism of the capitalistic western civilization they went to the whaling which happens almost exclusively in the orient and for some reason is viewed as an equal or worse evil to the deforestation, the pollution and the wars of the western civilization. Also, the dynamic female characters degenerated to two mothers, driven from their emotions, weak, irrational whereas the father figures are the voice of reason and the only ones capable to fight and protect their families...\nThe plot is trivial and repetitive. Tiresome. Sully's children are kidnapped two or three times in a desperate effort to fill the movie with some uninspired action. The secondary characters are irrelevant and the only way they found to create some interesting characters was to resurrect the characters who died in the first movie...\nIn overall, it was clear to me that this movie was created only to exploit the success of the first movie, and, as such, to fill the pockets of the producers, with the minimal effort..."},{"comment":"The world building and visuals are the best part of this movie.

But for the most part, it was very entertaining with amazing vfx."},{"comment":"I'd forgotten how much I'd fallen in love with Pandora the first time round. This film expands the world spectacularly panning out across the Navi species into other races, other tribes and the seascape. Where the first film had an intimate feel as if we were peering into the lives of a forgotten lost tribe, this film feels more like following the epic journey of a family across the world. Acting, special effects, the story and the score all build to give some spectacular and emotive scenes. The scenes of struggle in the water were very visceral for me I was gasping for air alongside the characters - the feeling of fear in the water is captured very well. The colouring and clarity of the world is magnificent and the addition of the bioluminesce effects in the water were magical for me.\n\nUnfortunately the pacing felt off to me. The first part was fairly rushed diving straight from birth of first child to rebellious teenagers needing firm guidance. I didn't engage with the story till quite far into the film for this reason. When connections start forming in the new tribe is when I started to care about the family. Then action scenes towards the end of the film feel much too long and drawn out, especially with the addition of irrational moments just to prolong action. It sometimes felt like spectacle for spectacles sake and I started thinking about how much money the studio would like to squeeze out of the series. \n\nI think the editing was a bit off too. The transitions and cuts were jarring at times bordering on feeling amateur. These moments disengaged me from the experience and the flow of the story felt interrupted too. There were random black cuts where I actually thought wtf!\n\nThe script and moments between the adolescents of the movie were off putting at times too. I understand the decision to make them very human in behaviour and speech, so that we as the audience would quickly understand their various characters (rebellious, good child, innocent, hippy etc) but occasionally I found it all a bit annoying or over the top. I found myself thinking they were intentionally using some of the MCU tricks to tap into that market. \n\nThe stereotyped caricatures and over played dynamics also got tiring quickly - they felt like lazy storytelling rather than connecting to essential things in the human experience. The bad guy losing all sanity in the name of revenge actually made him lose his edge for me. Hero - family that are amazing at everything also got tiring quickly. And the scenes depicting the resource abuse and hunting were a tad too gratuitous for me - over painting the bad guys as evil. \n\nThere are real moments of emotion however which redeem the film. The parents discussing how to bring up their children, people connecting over shared experiences, loss and the struggle of families against the world. The acting was always top notch imo even if the script or story wasn't quite there. The stunning landscapes and beautiful score heightened these moments wonderfully. \n\nWhere Romantic love, colonial-evils and connection with nature where the main themes of the first film - these themes are carried on but wrapped in new themes - strength of family and strengths of community (both navi and natural). By the end I felt I'd been on an epic emotional journey. And seen lots and lots of water."},{"comment":"I would just NOT recommend it."},{"comment":"3 and 1\/4 Stars. I was blown away by the 3D and people are saying it's a forgettable story but I think they're overlooking it. I'm more excited to see what happens then I was in the first movie  because I'm more invested in the characters, they have very interesting stories and more defined personalities. I think there wasn't that much if any in the first film so I think it was going to be an improvement no matter what they did, I'm glad they put in the effort."},{"comment":"Yet another rehash of elements of numerous\nMovies from the last 20 years.

It's amateurishly done with style."},{"comment":"\"The movie could have been much better if it had delved deeper. My feeling was that the film wanted to focus more on the scenery than on the story, and the way Jake Sully and Neytiri were practically taken out of the movie and completely sidelined. In the previous film, they didn't show as much of their romance as fans wanted to see, and instead of fixing that, they focused entirely on their children, who are typically the kind of kids you expect from a strong couple that has done so much. The problems presented were superficial and could have been solved with a simple conversation. And what about the final battle? Compared to the previous film, it was horrible. There was much less focus on the overall battle and instead it focused on the fight against Frances Ardmore and then their escape from the boat. If the movie had done the basics, it would have been much better.

I didn't think any of the actors were phoning it in, and even the younger ones did a good job. This movie's visuals basically blow away any other's in the past 5 years, which is impressive. With all of the films using The Volume at Lucasfilm and Marvel, it was nice to see VFX\/CGI that didn't look like a PlayStation 2 quality background or PlayStation 2 characters. The social messaging in the film was there, but it didn't beat a person over the head.

But if you are going to make a billion dollar film with all of these amazing special effects, you should make sure the story is just as good. There were many moments that took me out of the story because the decisions that Jake Sully makes are very baffling. To begin, when his children are put in danger by invading soldiers, he could have called upon his entire tribe to come together to take them down, which would have ended the conflict of the movie right away. Instead, he goes at it alone with Neytiri, and allows the soldiers to escape. It also seems selfish and baffling for Jake to leave his tribe who he spent the entire first movie fighting beside to bring conflict to peaceful communities who were burned down just for this one man. The fact that Jake is being put first over entire communities of peaceful people is very upsetting to watch. This movie depicts the suffering of indigenous people for the pleasure of the audience watching. This film drew inspiration for the indigenous people but did little to include them in cast of crew film roles. I dread having to watch any more sequels to this franchise."},{"comment":"Great visuals! Enjoyed it"},{"comment":"Minha opini\u00e3o: Uma constela\u00e7\u00e3o de artistas Sam, Zoe, Sigourney, Kate, Cliff, Stephen,...Depois de 13 anos retorna com sendo a maior bilheteria de 2022. @JamesCameron mais uma vez se supera, com sendo o maior criador de filmes que suberam a casa dos bilh\u00f5es. Este filme n\u00e3o superou o 1\u00ba em bilheteria, mas fechou 2,4 Bi d\u00f3lares, precisa de mais? Neste filme a presen\u00e7a de humanos \u00e9 bem menos com exces\u00e3o de Jack Champion. Aqui \u00e9 uma continu\u00e7\u00e3o do 1\u00ba se passa anos depois onde os humanos voltam novamente ao planeta. Antigos inimigos s\u00e3o \"ressuscitados\" mas agora como Navis exemplo do cel. Miles o grande vil\u00e3o do 1\u00ba filme, mas seu filho S\u00edder \u00e9 criado pelos Navis agora. E com o retorno do Cel. E sua equipe de Navis e agora com seus poderes, invandem a selva e v\u00e3o atr\u00e1s de Jake. Que foge com sua fam\u00edlia para longe para uma parte do Planeta onde existem Navis que vivem na \u00c1gua, por isso o nome do filme. Assim existe um resist\u00eancia na aceita\u00e7\u00e3o deles na nova tribo que adquiriram especialidade no conv\u00edvio na \u00e1gua e oceanos. E aqui existe toda aquela estoria de adolescentes de prache, rebeldia contra os pais e as regras, bulling, desafios, mentiras, brigas e muito problemas. Al\u00e9m de rolar uns climas. E com tudo isso, boa parte do filme \u00e9 usado para mostrar este mundo dos oceanos e seus animais aqu\u00e1ticos sendo claro uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o com os nossos, e trazendo como um pano de fundo a quest\u00e3o ecol\u00f3gicas, hambiental, preserva\u00e7\u00e3o. Onde uns dos animais nos lembra diretamente a baleia, orca, golfinhos,.... Este filme tras sim alguns embates, mas se comparado com o 1\u00ba, esta longe. Ao final tras uma batalha maior, mas de longe menor em quest\u00e3o de propor\u00e7\u00e3o em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao 1\u00ba. Aqui James se preocupou muito mais com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o do mundo NAvis da \u00e1gua ou oceano, seria o mais correto. Apesar de aqui termos nomes de peso os verdadeiros protagonistas deste filme foram os jovens. Pois eles que mostram este novo mundo e a intera\u00e7\u00e3o com os animais aqu\u00e1ticos. E temos o jovem Spider que \u00e9 filho Cel. Se ele era do bem ou n\u00e3o, pois ele trabalha para os 2 lados. Sim um filme que surpreende, mas no 1\u00ba assisti 2 vezes no cinema, por t\u00e3o facinado que fiquei. Aqui n\u00e3o senti esta vontade. Apesar de ter sido a maior bilheteria do ano 2022, n\u00e3o o coloco como o melhor filme do ano. E mais uma vez ele n\u00e3o foi a grande Honra no Oscar. Que no 1\u00ba tenho certeza que foi boicote, aqui n\u00e3o acho isso.\nRoteiro e enredo s\u00e3o bons. Interpreta\u00e7\u00f5es boas dos atores.\nVale apena assistir? Com certeza.

Is it worth the wait? Definitely. Does it live up to the standards set by the first? YES, and it exceeds them tenfold. First, the big aspect driving this franchise, visual effects. The cgi in the first film was great. The cgi in this film are spectacular. My only complaint is that at times, scenes looked like they were from a video game. While this did affect my viewing experience slightly, it was rare and far between. The story, while incredibly simple to follow, did a fantastic job at picking up where the first one left off and did a great job at setting up the \"potential\" next 3 films. This is mostly due to the introduction of the water Na'vi clans as well as the phenomenal acting done by the new and old characters alike. The introduction of several new creatures is also really cool. This is one to see on the biggest screen possible and in 3D or 4D. It makes the film look so much more stunning than a normal theater screen. While it's not the best film of the year, it is the most beautiful looking and well-made."},{"comment":"Just the perfect sequel to the first avatar"},{"comment":"Loved it.

Though it's good in its own right, it's not the presentation the original was. \nIn the first movie, we were mostly introduced to the forest environment and animals as part of action sequences. This is not the case in the sequel which spends a lot of dull moments familiarizing us with life in the water.\nThat being said, Avatar : The Way of Water is visually stunning. It has a strong script, when building the story or executing action scenes. But the script lags during those long dull moments. It benefits from a strong cast capable of making this sci-fi environment and the story believable.\nVisuals are stunning and the CGI is incredible. The diverse alien creatures are easy to accept. The movie allows the viewer to suspend disbelief and immerse themselves in a world totally foreign to us earthlings."},{"comment":"What a bad story and besides the water scenes which came across heavy CGI.

The ending is known two weeks before movie's premiere, no surprises. If the plan is to have sequence after sequel, why don't you sacrifice some of the good characters to make it more articulate? I only loved the fighting sessions, not exactly new, except the cruelty when killing the (fantasy) whales. They make you feel guilty even when they are digital creatures, not to mention destroying digital nature (digital tears are welcome). I can't wait for the next two movies. Really. I mean, i will not wait! Like a did for this one. Counting the days to the release, not next time.

GREAT IN 3D"},{"comment":"In my personal opinion, Avatar 2 did not meet my expectations. While the film had stunning visuals and special effects, I found it to be lacking in terms of plot and character development. The storyline felt predictable and lacking in depth, failing to engage me as a viewer. The characters themselves felt one-dimensional and underdeveloped, making it difficult to form any emotional connections with them.\n\nIn terms of pacing, I felt that the film was inconsistent. Some parts felt rushed while others dragged on, making it difficult to maintain interest throughout the 3-hour runtime. Additionally, the themes explored in the film, such as environmentalism and corporate greed, felt clich\u00e9d and unoriginal, lacking any real depth or insight.\n\nMy 5 main reasons:\n\n\nThe Storyline: The author argues that the plot of the film is predictable and lacks depth, making it unengaging and unmemorable.\n\nThe Characters: The author believes that the characters in the film lack development and depth, making it difficult for audiences to connect with or care about them.\n\nThe Visuals: Despite the impressive special effects, the author believes that the film relies too heavily on visual spectacle, sacrificing storytelling and character development in the process.\n\nThe Themes: The author argues that the themes explored in the film, such as environmentalism and the dangers of corporate greed, are clich\u00e9d and unoriginal, lacking any real depth or insight.\n\nThe Pacing: The author feels that the film is poorly paced, with the story feeling rushed in some areas and dragging in others, making it difficult to stay engaged throughout.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with Avatar 2 and believe that it could have been improved with more focus on character development and a stronger, more engaging plot. While the film may have appeal for some viewers, it did not resonate with me personally and left me feeling unsatisfied."},{"comment":"The problem with this movie is that, despite spectacular visuals on a scale never seen before, the movie bogged down very heavily by a simply atrocious screenplay, predictable and cliche-ridden story, and some of the most banal dialogue ever to find it's way into a blockbuster of this magnitude. Even any aspiring writer had written it then it would never have gotten read by an agent let alone produced into a movie.

Clearly, no, but the movie uses them as decoys for its only impelling desire, which are continuous CGI orgasms. unfortunately, the visual experience can'tbe justified by itself only as it needs still something that the CGI is about, which the movie has no interest to follow in any further than a truism that recognizes no possible ramifications  and circumstances plausibility.

And if this could be the way to heal the earth.\n\n7 jake goes to do tests and at the same time they discover that the substance of the whales' brain could be the energy conductor that could transfer large amounts of data without burning the receiver's brain. And they are excited to use this energy conduit to finally create eternal life for wealthy humans. Because they could manufacture bodies of avatars at the cost of billions and when the person is going to die they could buy a body and transport the mind to the avatar. But before finishing the genetic mapping Jake stops the scans and leaves.\n\n\n8 by secretly reporting the discoveries to Earth, the executives there then see the potential for profits and decide to send a special group of their armies to kidnap jake to finish the genetic mapping of the research and hunt the planet's whales for the new substance. Look what a beautiful justification for everything.\n\n9 With terrorism affecting everyday life in the village of the forest and fearing the kidnapping of one of his children, Jake decides to run away and hide in the water town.\n\n10 and from there, just take the current film and just reassemble it following this premise and, in my opinion, it would justify everything we saw in the film and it would still be possible to cut a good part and stay at 2 hours and 20.\n\n11 Just cut all that part of the new invasion and the use of the same previous villain that magicaly return again plese forgot this.\n\nVillains could be navis radical members who don't accept jake as an equal and these are the ones trying to get rid of him and take over pandora with weapons provided by humans to unbalance the fight.\n\nWhat do you think?"},{"comment":"An excellent film, you can put it as a standard and a classic for a long time.

Still, she can only exist in a nebulous dream world, either as a symbol of the goddess mother Eva, a dead female scientist, or a non-human animal Tulkun, the man once again found the goddess of nature who rules life and death. Still, he can not link her to the enslaved wife and daughter.\n\nPerhaps Cameron perceives his self-contradiction, or the fear caused by the contradiction between the two, anxiety brought about by the separation of the two powers of the female characters ruling fertility and death, so that the woman heading life away from violence (the power of death), and the woman leading violence away from fertility, can be very clearly perceived, where the female characters, all must choose, it is evident that the fertility goddesses The female characters who decide the power of death, the commander-in-chief of the Sky People Command, and the occasional woman who doesn't know her name (although these goddesses of death are suspected of deliberately good European and American feminism to make up the numbers).\n\nOf course, Cameron also thought of a way to solve the relationship between the mother and violence, the mother is the archer, but she stays away from violence most of the time; she is forbidden to initiate violence for herself, but she still plays the meek wife in daily life, taking care of the man, as well as cooking for the man, bandaging, so the mother is usually away from the violence of the Virgin, only in exceptional circumstances are allowed to use violence, that is, the son and husband Threatened. The advancement of the feminist movement allowed women to be empowered, but only if that empowerment was only for the allegiance of the patriarchal family.\n\nWhy? Because once the mother is free to use violence like the father, the father's position of absolute power is threatened, and the father's legitimate existence is inevitably questioned. In Cameron's film, the father's power comes only from death, and he must infinitely magnify the power of men's death to retain the legitimacy of men in power.\n\nWhen the ancient goddess reappears, she is the warmth of new life and brutal death. For a baby, to be looked at and loved by its mother is life, and to be ignored and neglected by its mother is dead, which is the first power structure experienced by human beings.\n\nNo matter how Cameron sings the praises of the patriarchal family, this is also a time when the patriarchal family is disintegrating, and the patriarchal family under the marriage system is gradually deteriorating.\n\nIn the matriarchal family and the patriarchal family, the empowerment of the man in the family cannot be accomplished without the woman joining the marriage. The confrontation between matriarchal and patriarchal power is also between these two kinds of families, that is, between mothers and wives.\n\nA wife is not a mother; a mother does not become a wife; it is a two-choice problem for women, a wife who surrogates children for her husband and a mother who chooses genes for her children.\n\nNatural mothers are brutal and cold, do not create offspring for any male, and look coldly at the male competition, the weak die, and the strong win, mothers always choose the winner, even if they choose the same winner, but it does not mean that the mother will become a wife, the winner is always changing, and the mother's choice is constantly changing.\n\nThe people who enslave their mothers will be enslaved; totalitarianism is birthed in patriarchy, this is the punishment of man for turning mothers into wives, but it is not the only punishment, nor is it the heaviest.\n\nHumans have already lost their mothers, so every child has a lifelong lack of so-called sweet drama in the male lead, unconditional love, and attention to the heroine of the male information to provide shelter and security for women. Are they the real man? In nature, only the mother is unconditional love and shelter existence humans look for love as children look for their mothers.\n\nThe role of the father in the patriarchal family is to imitate the missing mother, but it is not like men to be mothers; sexuality is the final point of their reproduction; they are born unable to link with their babies, they are frightened, widowed, frequent cheaters, rely on authority to maintain legitimacy (like the awkward father in Avatar), but they are also missing mothers, people look to their wives, to their husbands, even People look to their wives, to their husbands, and even to their children and those in power for motherly love. Still, the traces of mothers have long disappeared into history, and love has become control, kidnapping, and deprivation.\n\nFor too long, humanity has been without mothers, and wives who are disappointed in their husbands are even raising their children as their mothers, demanding attention, motherhood, and shelter from them.\n\nWe all hope that Eva, the mother goddess, will return to earth, she is as we imagine, powerful, warm, cruel, breeding life, but she also brings death, although at this time she is still far away, all the children lacking a mother are longing for her.\n\nUntil then, humans can only become their mothers."},{"comment":"A little disappointed in the beginning."},{"comment":"Great movie!

You would never know the entire movie is CGI with the actors acting out their roles in front of green screen with no sets or props. \n\nI watched it in a smaller theater, so probably didn't get the whole 3D experience, but, some of the 3D was really good. But, have seen better. It was also a really great story.\n\nThe only thing that keeps it from being a 5 is that the human boy made no sense.\nNever explained why he was there, or how they ended up with him.\n\nThe only thing I could figure is that they needed an inside guy to cover various plots in the movie. So, that was kind of distracting from the story a bit.\n\nAlso it was not as good as the first Avatar. But, the effects and the genius work put into the film is pretty amazing. Can't imagine what it must have been like to act without anything but green screen to interact with. It was really good."},{"comment":"Well thought out.

I loved every minute of this film, the cinematography is outstanding as James Cameroon makes yet another masterpiece movie with beautiful cinematography. The action was great, the character development is definitely good and a epic finale you won't want to miss! Great movie and the best of the 2 thus far!"},{"comment":"it was a long breath hold, but Cameron finally made it. he gave us a complete, comprehensive (at most times) and an overall pretty satisfying experience at the cinema once again only to leave us wanting for more.\n\nthis film is in every way better than the first. the story has heart, the battles pack an emotional punch, the visuals want you to pack your bags and leave for pandora, and most of the events happen naturally throughout the course of the film. I think cameron actually listened to some of the criticism which has been going throughout the years for the first avatar movie and actually tried to tell a better and more engaging story whilst providing us with a technical achievement.\n\nfirst of all, talking about the visual effects and the cinematography (which are the film's core strengths), it's just mind-boggling. I haven't got the slightest idea how they managed to achieve the shots they have on-screen. each and every frame of this film can be a wallpaper and no one would complaint. cinematographer Russell Carpenter really manages to keep your eyes glued to the screen with his abilities. despite most of the actors being the Na'vi this time, you can't tell that they are not real. each and every Na'vi looks insane and meticulously detailed which helps us to differentiate the focus characters when a large no. of them are present in frame. the vfx team deserve all the respect for this.\n\nnow, talking about the performances, they're all spot on and not a single loose thread can be seen. Worthington as Jake Sully\/Toruk Makto might be a problematic father but everything gets all right in the end when he shares a moment with his son Lo'ak which was probably one of the best emotional moments from the film. Zoe Salda\u00f1a, whose character Neytiri takes a backseat in the overall film does more than required in the scenes she's in and proves to us that she is an important and irreplaceable character in the entire series. Stephen Lang being given a much better role this time around manages to be a worthy antagonist for the Na'vi and has a much more personal involvement in his battle against the Sully's. loved to hate him in the film. the standouts for me particularly were Sigourney Weaver as Kiri and Britain Dalton as Lo'ak who get to do the most in the film and press most of the emotional buttons.\n\nanother thing which I liked and disliked at the same time was the frame rate. the film for most of it's runtime runs at a dazzling 48 frames per second but for some reason cuts to the standard 24 frames per second in between shots. this was really distracting and at times took me out of the scene. i think cameron struggled to maintain the frame rates of the shots and should've gone with either of the two instead of keeping them both.\n\nnow, talking about the story, it's better than the first alright but still doesn't quite get interesting where it could match the amount of technical marvel which was being displayed on screen. Cameron does write a better story than the first but at the beginning, it sure does feel like the film is a sequel, just for the sake of being a sequel when the sky people go and return within 5 minutes of the runtime whereas in reality, it has been decades since they first left. that just feels lazy and cinematic liberty taken too far. the emotional weight is much more significant than the first and the final battle feels like an emotional ride, although I would need more than this predictable story to step in the theatres for the next film as I was able to tell each and every single thing that was going to happen next right from the moment things start to happen.\n\noverall, I'd say do not miss this in the theatres even if the story is weak because it's better than the first presented to you on a plate of visually dazzling shots with some great performances."},{"comment":"There wasnt enough bright colors. The movie king of dragged on. But I enjoyed it very much"},{"comment":"Better than the original"},{"comment":"If you want to give your eyes a truly CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE of an experience, so watch this movie.

Stunning work by James Cameron. Can't wait for the third."},{"comment":"A pesar de que esta secuela tardo a\u00f1os en llegar, es un regreso magistral al mundo de Pandora.

Es una pel\u00edcula bastante disfrutable y demuestra que Avatar tiene mucho m\u00e1s que ofrecer. Puede que en los \u00faltimos momentos de pel\u00edcula no se sienta tan \u00e9pica como la anterior, pero es una buena secuela que comienza a extender este universo creado por James Cameron que sin duda est\u00e1 destinado a convertirse en una de sus mejores creaciones. Dejando algunos cabos sueltos e inc\u00f3gnitas para ser resueltos en otra entrega, Avatar: The Way Of Water es sin duda una espectacular secuela y lo mejor para despedir el 2022.

Now, I have some problems with this movie, and I also have things that I really enjoyed. But let's cut the crap. Bad News first, as always.\n\nThe movie tries too hard to emotionally connect to the audience through scenes where family bonding in prominent. Like, way to hard. Sure, it got the reactions of sorrow for sure, and it definitely calls for being an emotional movie because of this, but it causes other things to be ignored or pushed aside. There was no clash or fight for screen time. Most of this movies screen time was family moments, and that wouldn't be bad if this wasn't an action movie.\n\nThe family moments or the scenes trying to introduce you to all these new concepts are dragged on and makes a very exponential climax that just kind of appeared like a a final boss, not built up to over time, and it doesn't feel right. It feels like a very forced climax. There were a lot of ideas just shoved into a feature length film. They don't want to have to make a sequel to the sequel, so they rushed this into a smaller time frame than the plot could handle.\n\nAnother thing is certain scenes have a lot of animation inconsistencies. It doesn't seem to appear to be able to decide on a specific FPS rate, and it really messes with your eyes, especially on the big screen. \n\nIt's good enough to watch, as the elements of action were amazing to watch and very engaging. It introduces new characters that are easy to root for and care for, and have complex stories of their own to tell. This movie has other good things, but over all, this movie is just above average. That's all I can say about it."},{"comment":"I saw it in 3D and it was amazing. The special effects were awesome.

Of course, this is unsurprising with James Cameron creating some of the biggest spectacles Hollywood has churned out and with the first Top Gun being as old-school blockbuster as it gets. However, with Marvel and superhero films hegemonising the modern blockbuster-scape and with little room for any competition to adequately shine, it is surprising the sequel to a 13-year old film managed to be the commercial and critical success it has. Avatar reminds Hollywood a blockbuster should not be a lineage of successive films akin to a game of trivia, but ought to be an experience which justifies the price of a cinema ticket.\n\nThe Avatar sequel has managed to rekindle interest among cinemagoers for huge CGI spectacles with blockbusters being oversaturated with dodgy 'hit-and-miss' visual effects, by pushing the boundaries (once again) of what is possible. Perhaps the greatest achievement of this film is not its revolutionary use of computer technology to render an alien world without looking overtly fake, or stressing the eyes of the viewer to the point of irritation, but to do so without alienating its audience and creating it believably with a sense of  familiarity. A world crafted so intricately and with so much personal dedication from its director, visual effects teams and concept artists, that it is difficult to overstate the sense of artistry and personality in the film. \n\nComplimenting the visuals, the score expertly composed by Simon Franglen (as a replacement of the late James Horner) is fundamental to the creation of a world of such beauty and virility, and the immersion within the depths of the rich ocean or intimidating landscapes of the forest. Franglen builds off Horner's magic with an equally rich score which helps convey the enormity of Pandora, and is reflective of the enchanting setting. \n\nThe Way of Water does indeed have its weaknesses, as any film does and ought to strive to, as to create a piece of art is to make mistakes. The inconsistent frame rate contradicts the verisimilitude of the world and its characters, and would otherwise be better left without bar some isolated sequences. Further, James Cameron has always been spotty with dialogue, and Avatar: The Way of Water is no exception in some sequences, with ill-thought writing choices holding back some otherwise exceptional and dramatic sequences - as well as its characters. Further, the narrative is indeed somewhat derivative and hardly stands out as the most original screenplay - just as with most blockbusters - however, it does not distract from the films subtext and key messages, nor does it from the world it creates. \n\nAs with much of Cameron's other projects, the subtext is clear - the environment and its creatures are important and ought not be destroyed for profit, and the mistreatment of indigenous people is a stain on human connection. Of course, this acts as a sufficient and poignant socio-cultural criticism, offering an interesting enough narrative. With most modern-blockbusters serving only the commercial interests of studios at the expense the auteurship and creativity, Avatar stands out as an example of a film which can do both when a studio vests power and trust in an individual willing to push the boundaries of today's cinema. \n\nAlthough the film certainly is not perfect, it is representative of a positive trend, which studios will hopefully follow which could see a total overhaul of the modern blockbuster akin to those of yesteryear."},{"comment":"Really good movie I recommend you watch it 10\/10"},{"comment":"Would go see it again"},{"comment":"A really fun experience in 4D, especially the part where Jake's son walks over the back of the whale-like creature, there is a fun surprise waiting for you.

I found the bullying scenes of the younger son a bit clich\u00e9 to be honest (true, but clich\u00e9) but overall solid story.\nThe movie is a fun experience, but sometimes a bit too heavy in CGI, which might at times come across as animation-like, even on the big screen I watched it on.

The sky people hadn't learnt anything from their first visit. I was expecting an evolution in the story. I was hoping they had been humbled and became curious to understand how the Avatars connect with the nature spirits, and maybe they could have had a transformation of sorts themselves.\n\nEven back in the day of founding white Australia the colonisers were aware of the mess they had made in America and other places and were at least trying to do it slightly better. (spolier: they didn't, but that's another story). In this movie the sky people are one-dimensional nasty killers at any cost (all those massive resources on another planet to catch one person was a weak plot line in itself). \n\nIt could have told a really important story for our times about the pursuit of working with difference in cultures and seeking mutually beneficial outcomes. eg. It could have been really nuanced with some of the sky people \"getting it\" and some of them stuck in the old dominator military ways. It would set up an epic heroic journey about creating civilisation amongst differing cultures - giving us hints about how we can now change our trajectory away from glorifying technology and military, and towards a meaningful and subtle connection to nature and divinity - whilst also bringing differing world views and cultures together. It's a story we really need to hear right now with all the polarisation that is going on in the world.\n\nInstead it was mostly glorifying military, giving people lots of visceral ideas about how to combine AI with military - super scary as they make it look so powerful, agile and sexy. The action sequences were classic juvenile testosterone Hollywood - completely over the top.\n\nNot only were the sky people not moved by the magic of the Navi's, they were downright angry about it - trying to kill the one person who had built a bridge between the two cultures. This is the worst-case scenario story that could have been told for Avatar 2.\n\nIt was all about revenge. Plus lots of old-school masculine loyalty tropes in there that feel quite dated in the 2020s. And the fact that they saved the villain to fight another day is so \ud83e\udd2e. It suggests that the next movie is going to be more of the same.\n\nOn a positive note the magical forest and underwater scenes were the highlight - so glorious, connecting and inspiring. This will inspire the nature-loving folk. But the high tech AI weaponry will likely arouse the non-thinking, gun-toting, right wing macho crowd who are all about defending their patch. It makes high tech military look exciting, sexy and inevitable. It normalises a dystopian future (like so many other hollywood movies do).\n\nPerhaps the making of this movie is a mirror of our times - it got so distracted in it's own high technology that it totally missed the substance of the story telling."},{"comment":"No real start to movie.

If youre ever debating what to see at the movies. I highly recommend Avatar: The Way Of The Water"},{"comment":"Camerons mad project after 13 years finds its heir in the second chapter of the Avatars saga with a movie that reaches new undiscovered technical peaks the result indeed is visually stunning and wonderful, both in 2D and 3D versions, because the canadian filmmaker and his troupe explore and invent new ways of making the Navis look real, expressive and absolutely free in their movements. I wont describe CGIs enhancements and peculiar aspects because, on the one hand, I dont have the capacity of doing that and, on the other hand, it would be too technical and boring, so Ill let that discussion in experts hands. The only thing I can say is that Camerons obsession for the underwater scenes produces a sort of deja-vu sensation in relation to his most recognizable work Titanic. The common elements indeed are many and certains frames, especially during the war on the sinking boat, recalls very clearly its (I dont know if its right to call it in this way) 97s ancestor. Yet The Way of Water isnt a sterile repetition of it because it opens a new narrative universe on Pandora and builds (like great sci-fi masterpiece) a story that uses technology and utopia as excuses to tell a story about a threaten family that tries, in order to survive, to settle in a new environment though its hostile and close in its traditions, it will be the real trial for the protagonists. Over a decade after the events of the first Avatar, the humans are building their future home on Pandora and the war with the Navis has never stopped. Colonel Miles Quaritch, died in the final battle in the first episode, is now a Navi, because the scientists had found the way to transfer the human mind to a Navis body. Jake Sully is become a real Navi and he is their chief in the Omatikaya tribe. He is still in love with Neytiri and they have 4 children the two boys Neytama and Loak, the daughter Tuk and the adopted daughter Kiri. When they fall prisoners of the humans (now in Navis bodies) along with Miles human son, Spider, Jake finally understand the danger they were in and, after a clash in the woods that leads to his childrens release, he decides to abandon their home and move to an another part of Pandora in order to save both his family and his tribe. However Miles is determined to find them everywhere and, with Spiders help (the only one Jake and Niytiri didnt release), he will hunt them in the Pandoras eastern seaboard. In the meanwhile, Jake and his family will find a home in the Metkayina tribe they are reef people and so the family will have to learn how to work and live in the water (quick reminder Omatikaya tribe used to live on trees). The main problem of the movie is the object of this last paragraph the screenplay. The trio composed by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver and Cameron himself indeed works with few and probably too simple ideas copied by teen fictions and epic dramas, mixed together with the folkoristic and indie world they created ex novo in the 2000s. If we not consider the underwater world they introduced, in The Way of Water its hard to find something really lasting or original. However, I really enjoyed the movie (I saw it three times), like probably all the world did (it raised 2,320 billion worldwide) because it takes on screen the real beauty and magic of cinema, made by dreams and wonder. It recalls you a primitive and ancestral happiness, sheer and pure, due to the incredible techincal work made. It deserves more than a watch in order to be fully appreciated and loved The Way of Water indeed its a movie that genuinely touches your heart and continues one of the most successful sagas in history. A must-see."},{"comment":"It was great enjoyed it throughtly"},{"comment":"We loved this movie best one to see in3 d our second time seeing the movie loved it"},{"comment":"Took my 8 year old daughter to this movie after showing her the first one at home ( she liked the first one)  and she asked me  to leave with her half way through the movie.

It's hard to imagine how Cameron could have topped what he did in the original. But not only does he succeed, he outclasses the original visually. Because of this, it's super easy to feel involved in the world. The environments, the underwater shots are groundbreaking, sometimes that won't be topped anytime soon. As for the rest of the film though in terms of story and characters, it seriously lacks. When I wasn't focused on the beautiful world I was quite uninvested with how Cameron executed the story. It was basically the same as the first time around only it's the bad guy who gets most of the screen time played effectively by Stephen Lang.

Be warned that this movie is a commitment as it is over three hours long! \n \nJake Sully (Sam Worthington), the human transformed into a Na'vi person, and his wife Ney'tiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) are back and now have four kids. With the unexpected return of the wicked Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who is brought back as a Na'vi impersonator along with his crew, the Sully's are forced to flee the forest and explore what other places on Pandora, their home planet, have to offer. \n \nSince this is the sequel to the mega-hit film, Avatar, I recommend watching the first film before viewing this one, as there are many important references and details that are key to following this film. The storyline leaves us with some more questions than answers; however it sets up moviegoers for the next installments. Viewing it on a big screen, especially in 3D \u2013 which I recommend \u2013 makes you feel like you're right beside the characters in the world of Pandora. Speaking of Pandora, the world building is absolutely remarkable. It expands our view of this amazing foreign planet. And as the name suggests, it focuses on the islands, oceans and reefs of Pandora. The aquatic plants and animals are majestic and gorgeously iridescent. The reefs and oceans are eye popping and staggering. Everything is so glowy and vivacious. If you thought the animation of the original film was awe-inspiring, wait until you watch this one! The animation is hyper-realistic. When looking closely, you can see the ultra-detailed textures of the characters and settings. The movement almost looks like it is from a cut scene of a video-game (it's honestly the best way I can describe it). Stephen Lang's performance as the Colonel is so powerful, and makes you hate his guts even more than you did in the first film. Sam Worthington as Jake and Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Ney'tiri seem to have developed even better chemistry than in the first movie.\n \nThe message of this movie is to always fight to protect loved ones. This movie also has strong messages about the bonds with family and friends. Be forewarned that there is violence and violence involving animals. \n \nI give Avatar: The Way of Water 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

The problem is with the story line. How did they bring that major and his men back to life and even in the blue suits? Also how come they got rid of the coffin where the solders had to be in order to be an Avatar? Looks like the story line will continue in Avatar 3 as the major seems to have nine lives. Story line is predictable and boring."},{"comment":"If you remember Avatar, or partly remember it, it's a CGI animated film that steals a lot of Roger Dean fantasy art imagery, has themes of colonial injustice and resource exploitation and features a lot of tacky turquoise and some \"big 80s robots\".\n\nThe film had an aura of respectability because CGI was \"fully flourishing\" in that decade; the perverse irony of Avatar is that it's a film about worshipping the power of nature yet there isn't a single natural image anywhere in the film.\n\nTHIS overlong \"epic sequel\" features, in no particular order: tacky turquoise characters (those character designs are wack, there's no way around it), and elements of M\u0101ori\/sea-friendly pacific culture repackaged in a way that's supposed to be honorific in a rich-white-guy\/corporate Hollywood kind of way. Overall the story is pretty thin, even for a \"kid's movie\". (that goes forever).\n\nPut it this way, James Cameron: you are bland. Your vibe is bland and it's not going to change. The only way to really make A2:WOW really work would be to have a GREAT opening scene, with thriller elements and an intense action sequences unfolding, without pointless excess or emotionless sentiment. Cameron, either because of his ego or simply because Titanic \"made a lot of money\" doesn't get this idea of carved-to-it's-essence story economy anymore. The film feels dilute and thin as a dramatic work and has, occasionally, very pleasing and carefully rendered computer graphics animations. As usual, people are raising complaints about the lack of natural frame blending we associate with 25 fps, and \"super-high-whizz\" 60 fps. \n\nTo be honest, audience backlash against this film is everywhere, so it may shade your view of what is, basically, a solid action\/adventure film - it's almost like a b-movie where the characters aren't real and the plot is underdeveloped but it goes boom crash bang (splash)."},{"comment":"Great disappointment \ud83d\ude25"},{"comment":"I liked the action.

I have a simple criteria for rating movies, can you see the money spent on the screen? In this case, you surely can.  Yes, it is very long, but it would be a shame not to meander through some of the most breathtaking CGI made to date.  If you are going to go big, then go crazy big.  This movie (somewhat like its predecessor) needs to be seen on the biggest screen to get the full experience.  Is the plot a bit rehashed? Yes, but there is just enough new stuff that it clears the originality bar (even if just by a little bit).  Perfect? No, but you can see the money spent on the screen and you can have a good time if you invest the attention span."},{"comment":"Great human stories!!

It is worth going to see on the biggest screen possible while it is still in theaters. When it gets to the small screen, however, it will be much less impressive. The story just makes no damn sense.

No. \n\nAbout 3\/4 the way through this movie the wow factor from the amazing CGI world wears off and you start to actually consider the plot. It's basically avatar 1 but worse. They bring the villain from the first one back and go to a new tribe of avatar. Why do they go to the new tribe? To protect the old one... I guess it's okay for the new tribe to get slaughtered, right? Anyway by the end of the movie we end up exactly where we ended up at the end of avatar 1 but this time the humans didn't leave and the bad guy isn't dead. The PERFECT set up for a sequel. A sequel we don't want and don't need. \n\nAvatar 1 was a complete story. There was nothing more to be said.

That thing was awesome. It blew my mind how great it was, and just because of that I give it a three stars!  It was great seeing it.....once, and only in cinema!

It's the sequel to \"Avatar\" and it took approximately 5 years to complete. \n\nPersonally, I loved everything about this film. But let's go bit by bit. The first obvious thing that comes to mind when watching this movie are the visual effects. I felt drawn to the story. I literally couldn't take my eyes off of it. The colors are extremely bright and rich. Even the smallest object was extremely thought out. No two colors on the screen clashed for even a second. In my personal experience, watching the movie in 3D was the right decision to make. It allowed me to submerge myself almost completely into every aspect of the film.\n\nAnother facet I really enjoyed was the soundtrack. I've always loved music, and listening to brand new pieces of what in my opinion are masterpieces completely blew my mind. Every single instrument heard was in tune and actively participated in making a well rounded experience overall.\n\nSomething that still amazes me till this day is the amount of special effects that we don't even notice sometimes. The number of things we overlook without even knowing are scandalous. The realism of every single invented character is astonishing. The amount of detail and effort put into creating each individual with its own physical and psychological characteristics is very easy to leave unnoticed.\n\nIn summary, I wholeheartedly believe that everyone who loves cinema should watch this film which I'm sure will be very much enjoyed."},{"comment":"I think some people having trouble connecting with the characters as there are many with difficult to recognize names but you do get a sense of who most of the important characters are, where they fit in the story and I don't think it hurts this storyline too much as there are at least three more installments. So don't expect to get everything all at once.. As It Seems our culture is all about instant gratification these days. Sorry, you're going to have to wait for a more complete saga.. not 14 yrs though.. & while this does round off fairly neatly as a sequel to the first Avatar, being a Powerhouse of audio and visual feasts throughout. It's definitely set up for even more interesting immersive feature scapes to dive into or sore through the Hallelujah mountains."},{"comment":"Great special effects!"},{"comment":"Loved it action adventure, superb they did not disappoint at all.

In fact, I put the glasses on the end of my nose so I could look over the top of them during the scenes that didn't have much 3D effect. That did not help the colors other than they weren't quite as dark. \nIt was very disappointing!

When my wife suggested we go see \"Avatar: The Way of Water\", I wasn't sure if I am ready to until almost midnight on an unusually cold and windy night, but every minute of it was worth it.  I am still unsure if the idea of bringing back Quaritich was a good idea (as opposed to creating a younger, different antagonist) - I guess a combination of how well Lang's performance in the original Avatar movie and perhaps lack of better ideas - but that really is the only somewhat questionable part to me - as overall I didn't find the plot as weak as critics note - and interestingly the extreme length was also totally bearable, even enjoyable.

However, some main characters are very lacking in any semblance of a story arc.\nThe antagonist is a letdown, fueled by a very bland motivation.\nThis is a cookie-cutter movie made for the masses.

In this particular theater, there was a full half-hour of previews in which the sound was stoked WAY WAY up.  Painful.

Phenomenal new and old talent; a soundtrack I can listen to for days. Must-see!"},{"comment":"Movies like this are what the theater experience is supposed to conjure up.  Pure entertainment, has great visuals, and a total value for my patronage."},{"comment":"The Way of Water is a big improvement over James Cameron's original film, keeping the visual spectacle but giving the story a bit more complexity this time around instead of just repeating the structure of every criticism of the American military that's come before. As a piece of entertainment, it completely lives up to the promise of a futuristic blockbuster and a sequel to the most successful film of all time, big worldbuilding with classic family and adventure elements; few directors can make a three hour runtime feel exciting and fresh, helped along by visuals that blow away just about anything that's come before. Plus, crab robots. \n\nWhat rubs me the wrong way is the shameless double dipping. The film works and is worth your time (at least until other production companies catch up to the technical capabilities in a few years), but let's not pretend that Cameron isn't putting a very expensive coat of paint on the proven formula from the original. Not only are the themes about environmental exploitation and colonialism almost entirely unchanged, but some of the more specific details are just going through token reskins so audiences don't get bored - forest Na'vi are replaced by ocean Na'vi (and there's already a promise that fire Na'vi are going to turn up in a sequel), unobtainium is replaced by a new hyper-expensive resource called amrita that not only stops aging but can only be obtained by drilling into the brains of space whales, and instead of making new villains, the script just says \"oh all the old bad guys that died? Their personalities were all saved so they're back again.\" \n\nUndeniably a fun watch that capitalizes on the strengths of the original film, but Cameron's ideas don't really get smarter, just bigger. And the next iteration is guaranteed to be a color palette swap, hopefully it will have some new ideas to go along with it. But this filmmaker clearly understands both his audience and entertainment value, so who am I to criticize? (3.5\/5)"},{"comment":"This is pretty much my new favorite movie!!!

Cameron seems to have otherwise felt like he had to use every animation effect (and every bad joke) he could command whether it was was plot-necessary or not, and every point-shooty-heavy-combat item he could construe, but once these had been shown off, the plot managed to make its way out from under...."},{"comment":"Love love loved this movie.

However it's not long before the sly people show up again in Pandora.... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.\n\nCouple of comments: After many years of delays, the long awaited sequel from James \"King of the World\" Cameron is FINALLY released. To be honest, it's been so long (13 years) that I don't remember much of the plot of the original Avatar, but I do recall the immersive viewing experience that it was. For this sequel, it seems that Cameron is concerned that a complex storyline might distract us and hence there is very little plot, basically that forest people becoming sea people are GOOD, and that sky people are BAD. Around that paper-thin premise, Cameron builds a visual spectacle that intends to encompass and overwhelm you, and guess what: Cameron succeeds. Along the way, Cameron liberally borrows from Star Wars (the sky people's main vessel is the ocean-equivalent of the Death Star), and from his own Titanic. Is the movie too long? Frankly yes and the initial 60-75 min. could've\/should've been trimmed quite a bit. But in the end, enjoy it for what it is: a visual experience unlike anything you've ever experienced. And did I tell you that forest people becoming sea people are GOOD? And that sky people are BAD?\n\n\"Avatar: The Way of Water\" opened in December and we saw it on Christmas day. The afternoon\/early evening XD 3D screening where we saw it at here in Cincinnati was well attended but nowhere near sold out, somewhat to my surprise. If you saw the original Avatar and enjoyed it, I'd readily suggest you check out this sequel, and draw your own conclusion."},{"comment":"Amazing visual effects!! So beautiful!!

I watched the movie 3 times and 3D Dbox is worth it and the best. There is an Easter egg or something because I noticed the toy the kids were playing with in the beginning of the movie and the toy Tuk had was the leonoptryx that jake sully rode in the first movie. It is a must watch and if you have questions or are confused after seeing it the first time watch it again and it will make more sense. I was unfortunately too young to see Avatar 1 because I was only 5. When i did see the first one in 2012 it was amazing because it was so new and magical. I watched the first one multiple times back to back because of how amazing it is. I saw The second one 3 times. The first time was in standard and it was great, 3D was great because it made me feel like i was there (sounds cringe worthy), then the last time i saw it in 3D Dbox and it is worth everything because when the seat move when they fly or swim and the rumble and motion in fight scenes make you feel like you are right there even more. If anyone still hasn't seen it i recommend you see it in 3D Dbox because it is 5000% worth it, especially a movie like Avatar The Way of Water.\nAlso recommend watching the first one before seeing the new one for obvious reasons."},{"comment":"great movie. avatar + subnautica = amazing experience for marine life fans"},{"comment":"Liked the story, graphics, sea creatures came out of the screen or the debris amazing.

He works very hard for making great visuals but he doesn't write a story or screen play he just took many sequence from his previous films and reshoot them with his new tech. For example ikran bonding scene in A2 was already in A1, Quaritch character in A2 was very similar to Jake Sully's A1 character, \nClimax ship sequence was similar to Titanic, Nothing new it's like remake of his previous films. Sound design was not up to the mark. Sound of forest in A1 >>> Sound of water and forest in A2. Mind blowing 3d visuals is not enough for a complete movie. It's like a theme park ride."},{"comment":"Loved the visuals and creativity, its definitely what I appreciated the most. Movie is predictable which isnt bad but predictable.

Many scenes of just showing off the surroundings and the new tribe's way of life, but they've done it so beautifully that you never tire of it!"},{"comment":"James Cameron does it again.

It is a MUST SEE!!"},{"comment":"If you liked the first Avatar, you're probably going to like this one. \n\nMuch like the first film, and the many of James Cameron's movies, Avatar 2 is visually amazing. The effects and action sequences are visually stunning. \n\nThe story on the other hand, leaves a bit to be desired.

Story was pretty simple but still good."},{"comment":"I don't get it. Again, Avatar is a unoriginal story done with tall blue people. Ok I get it, the effects are cool. But how can CGI generate so much money with so many people going to see a way too long of a movie just for visual effects? Society is just plain dumb. The sheep keep following whatever the commercial tells them to do. I don't even feel like the effects are that captivating where I thought the movie would even be worth a second viewing. This movie is average at best. Way too long, poor acting, very predictable and not interesting enough, that I had to fight from falling asleep at times. The final action sequence was pretty good though but a horrible ending ruined it all. It's just regurgitated nonsense."},{"comment":"Family struggles: a tale as old as time"},{"comment":"We really enjoyed the movie especially the Ocean scene. So beautiful! I would watch it again."},{"comment":"Awesome job with Avatar: The Way Of Water 3D! \u2728"},{"comment":"I am surprised by sheer dumbness of people not able to understand why this movie is one of the greatest movie ever. There are some major reasons which easily puts it on a 10\/10 category.\n\n1. Greatest theatre experience one could get of a movie. Watching the movie was nothing less than a visual treat for my eyes.\n\n2. While the first movie saw that Na'vi people fought back with the sense of revenge, Avatar 2 made sure that it is not going to be typical mainstream movies where villain hits you, and you hit back and it's over. The emotions that it required to generate the sense of will for Jake Sully to fight for his family, is really what a man really would do when facing extreme circumstances, one would only fight and risk everything if he lost something so dear to him, an act which was so cruel done to him that it justified in his mind to go to war.\n\n3. Character development of every character, i mean every character happens. The scream of Neytiri was one of the most touching scene i felt from the movie.\n\nFor the first time one can say that watching a movie felt like reading through a fine written novel. No words can do justice to do the beauty that i experienced. Watched it 3 times already and still feel the need to watch it for the fourth time."},{"comment":"I enjoyed the immediate follow up to the first film after about 13 years. The story smoothly Inter grated the story and provided a more emotional, dark and expansive story to the Avatar universe. The visuals were great and I understand why James Cameron waited as long as he did to perfect the visuals. I would recommend this film to people who are unsure about watching it and will continue to keep watching the sequels to come. Besides the long wait time and needing to use the restroom I would recommend not drinking anything until the first hour in the movie. The long wait time wasn\u2019t all that bad though, it made it feel more expansive and  fully express the story."},{"comment":"Cool visuals, story wasnt good, didnt like that ending was big cliffhanger"},{"comment":"However you feel about the storyline... you can't deny the absolute feat we see on screen.

Se tard\u00f3 13 a\u00f1os en crear y expandir este mundo, explorando el mundo marino en documentales c\u00f3mo \u2018Deepsea Challenge' o \u2018Diving Deep', documentales por si mismos fant\u00e1sticos, y se traslada esa vida y ese realismo a esta cinta, ya sea en primer o segundo plano hay una ambici\u00f3n por construir y tele transportar al espectador al mundo de pandora, y creo que lo logra. As\u00ed mismo con los actores que m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de sus actuaciones, el trabajo f\u00edsico por el que tuvieron que pasar 100% vale la pena, Kate Winslet logr\u00f3 estar 7 minutos bajo el agua, es una dedicaci\u00f3n realmente incre\u00edble, se puede sentir esa conexi\u00f3n de los actores con sus personajes.\n\nLa trama es una cr\u00edtica a la misma ambici\u00f3n humana y a su \"justificaci\u00f3n de la supervivencia\", la pel\u00edcula toma nuevamente ese foco contra los humanos que puede llegar a sentirse inc\u00f3modo ver al estereotipado \"h\u00e9roe\" de cualquier historia c\u00f3mo el antagonista, cada acci\u00f3n de los humanos realmente duele lo real que se siente, los humanos son destructivos, no les importa lo que pueden pisar o destruir con total de llegar a su objetivo que se vuelve tangible en la nefasta escena de la ballena, en la que sale a relucir c\u00f3mo toman lo que les interesa de cualquier ser vivo volvi\u00e9ndolos desechables para seguir con su objetivo, que es una referencia a la ya extinta moda de piel de animal a las figuras de marfil o productos que se basan de recursos de seres vivos, y as\u00ed mismo en la destrucci\u00f3n del habitad de otras especies, pueden reforestar, incendiar con el \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito de sobre explotar y adue\u00f1arse de los recursos, para inflar los bolsillos de una minor\u00eda que no le interesa nada m\u00e1s all\u00e1 que su propio sustento. Una cosa que no me encant\u00f3 de la pel\u00edcula fue que no haya un protagonista claro, la pel\u00edcula explora los arcos de cada personaje en paralelo sin establecer el real conflicto interno de los personajes, la narrativa transiciona de un sub arco a otro, no cerrando con cada uno de ellos c\u00f3mo el de Kiri o rest\u00e1ndole importancia a personajes c\u00f3mo Neytiri, cosa que llega a afectar al mismo Jake; pero aun as\u00ed la trama es lo suficientemente autosustentable para seguir desarrollando a sus personajes aunque sea de una forma \"convencional\" con la trama principal, el conflicto interno principal de los personajes me parece fabuloso, salir de su tierra para as\u00ed mismo llegar a una completamente diferente y luchar para aprender su cultura es hermoso, es narrativamente lo que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3, que s\u00ed, puede llegar a ser un poco extensa la resoluci\u00f3n del mismo conflicto, pero visualmente es hermoso ver c\u00f3mo exploran el oc\u00e9ano as\u00ed mismo cuando exploran la aldea, la pel\u00edcula puede ser sobre explicativa o ambigua en varias ocasiones, pero todo eso se tapa con el hermoso mundo que nos presenta esta historia, ya sea en el 1 acto con el mundo que ya conocemos que sigue siendo igual de hermoso con esa aura de \"peligro\" as\u00ed mismo con el mundo acu\u00e1tico, la pel\u00edcula cuando busca ser expositiva con su mundo es una experiencia \u00fanica. La pel\u00edcula se puede quitar el clich\u00e9 que injustamente se le catalog\u00f3. \n\nJames Cameron hace una maestr\u00eda en la construcci\u00f3n de su mundo, cada secuencia es espectacular, la creaci\u00f3n de la fauna es hermosa, cada ser vivo se siente real; algo muy complicado de hacer, aunque se recreen los animales que ya conocemos. Los Na'vi se sienten reales, sus expresiones se sienten genuinas as\u00ed mismo con sus movimientos, es incre\u00edble lo emp\u00e1tico que pueden llegar a ser con el espectador. La fotograf\u00eda llega a sentirse por momentos naturalista, hay escenas que parece que se est\u00e1n grabando desde un avi\u00f3n, que siento que es algo que busc\u00f3 lograr Russell Carpenter, hay zooms que dan referencia a los mismos documentales de Cameron, y para mi ese es el logro t\u00e9cnico m\u00e1s grande de la pel\u00edcula, el hacer sentir al espectador que est\u00e1 viendo algo m\u00e1s que un mundo construido digitalmente, esta cinta hace sentir al espectador que est\u00e1 viendo un documental de Pandora. No hay palabras para describir esta experiencia, visualmente la pel\u00edcula es \u00fanica, es incre\u00edble lo real que se siente este mundo.\n\nAvatar 2, es una experiencia inversiva a otra realidad que en cada aspecto es hermosa."},{"comment":"Avatar the way of water was a visually thrilling experience with unmatched visual effects and a storyline unlike any other movie that iv seen.

I will say \u2026 this film actually broke me which is hard to do. This is Avatar The Way of Water \u2026 it is just awe inspiring and beautiful in it's visuals, it's storytelling and action sequences. I have been to see it 4 times \u2026 it is that good! Yes it is a little long and for me you could remove perhaps 20 minutes or so of this movie which would actually make it just as good if not better but it is nit picking. The score is amazing too. I was a little worried with the passing of the great James Horner (RIP) and was wondering who could take over from him but Simon Franglen knocks it out of the park \u2026 bravo! I am invested in this world fully now and i cannot wait for the third movie to come out. My 7 year old daughter absolutely loved it too..sat there for the duration never getting bored.

The problems all lie in the writing. The first one was a little apathetic in its writing, yeah its Fern Gully, Dances with Wolves, etc and has a strong white messiah complex with the bad guys being the corporate greed and humans trying to destroy the planet with their lust for metals. Now it's... The most tedious annoying and tedious character from the first movie brought back through deus ex machina (why tf wasn't the main characters brother also backed up, eh? If they already had this backup and clone tech, why didn't they use it to begin with?!) my prediction is they're gonna have a whole army of the same jerk military guy in the next movie, and it's gonna be like the Smith virus in the Matrix movies. Ugh. Anyway, I've already heard that they're deep in production of the next several movies and the military Ahole guy is in ALL of them? What??? Ugh. Come one James Cameron, get it together!!\n\nThis one was full of lazy plot holes, bunk character motivations, Snidely Whiplash levels of evil bad guys, and just so many \"what??!

I left after one hour because I made the mistake of buying 3D glasses. I am a big fan of fight scenes, but this was just- so violent I don't want to watch it. Yelling and constantly shooting each other for an hour with the sound of machine guns blasting from the theater speakers is not what I came for. In my opinion, it was really basic. The characters could have had a lot more personality but with CGI films it's not as necessary with added visuals. And I got used to the visuals REALLY fast. A friend of a friend's younger brother also saw it and said \"it was awesome.\" He's 10, so maybe I wasn't the target age. I hate making bad reviews, but personally, I don't see why people like it.

But not all promises were fulfilled.\nFirst, James Cameron did a great technical job again. The graphics and effects are still the best in industry. The 3D effect still looks impressive. And of course the main problem is still in story and setting.\nWorld of Pandora looks too unrealistic. It's like a little distorted version of Earth. Na'vi are just bigger humans with almost the same structure as Earth's humans. Animals and plants are just little changed versions of Earth's ones. The theme of intelligent planet is poorly covered. We have a strange version of the Noosphere. \nThe movie still has a very simple plot. We have a conflict between ultra-green aborigines and ultra-military humans. I wish the plot had more mature anti-capitalism and anti-imperialism ideas.\nFinally, Avatar: The Way of Water is still a great winter blockbuster because of impressive graphics and effects.

The Avatar films have been ones that I see for the visuals themselves and not the actual story and once again, the visuals are absolutely incredible. I'm glad that Cameron decided to hold off on making this movie until the technology was there because it really shows but it can be weird at times. Whenever the characters go underwater, it feels like the film was shot on the world's best IPhone. I mean that as both a positive and negative. The visuals look amazing but the frame rate is different and makes it feel weird. As beautiful as the underwater scenes are, it can be jarring when we go back to the surface as the frame rate is different. As with the first Avatar as well, the story is okay. In fact, the story is a little bit worse here as it feels like a 2 hour movie stretched to 3. The characters and acting are kind of all over the place here quality wise. Some of the acting is good like Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Kate Winslet but other actors like Sam Worthington aren't doing a great job but Sam Worthington's character is great here but Kate Winslet's doesn't feel important (for now). While the story is just okay, I'm not going to an Avatar movie for the story and I'm going for the visuals and since the visuals are so good then I feel satisfied with the movie. If James Cameron keeps making visually spectacular movies then I'll keep showing up. If you enjoyed the first Avatar or want a visually breathtaking movie then I would definitely check this out."},{"comment":"Although the story isn't perfect and the film has its flaws, Avatar: The Way of Water is an outstanding cinematic experience supported by beautiful visuals, great themes about family and our ecosystem, and great performances."},{"comment":"Loved this movie one of my all time favorite the 3d was out of this world tops any 3d movie I seen hope to see more like this movie in the future"},{"comment":"A great sequel that discards all the problematic elements the original might have had. \"Avatar The Way of Water\" tells a poignant story of family and the burdens children bear while adding in masterful visual effects and amazing worldbuilding.

Apart from that the \"animation\"-like underwater visuals look realistic but like the first,  story is lame."},{"comment":"Visually stunning and fast paced, making the more than 3 hours feel short. Absolutely requires cinema for enjoyment. The movie feels like a remake of the first movie just with the main character from the first movie already a native for kicking off a trilogy. I noticed that there were 5 writers credited for the script, but the quality of the story has not improved in any way. Rather than making the progress of the story a credible result of character and its development, characters are driven by the story to where they need to be and there is no discernible character development. The overall tone of the movie is very conservative with women lacking key roles other than one of them working as an actual deus-ex-machina. Sam Worthington as narrator is not good and it is annoying how often he talks about a father's job to protect. But the writers are on his side ignoring Saldana's role."},{"comment":"Impressive visual effects and stunning landscapes took us on the journey we had been waiting for!

The stuff that was shoehorned in, which was quite a bit were the main cringe moments for me.

A lot of the plot didn't make sense and I apologize for the spoilers here but :\n1. You would think the point of cloning the big bad guy was to continue on the humans mission to takeover pandora and not what is seems to be, give a guy with a vendetta all the money and equipment he needs to go \"get his revenge\" instead. How did targeting that 1 family help the humans in their efforts to overthrow pandora? They said earth was unlivable and they needed to colonize pandora. They could've just continued to attack  on the forests since clearly that is where the minerals are that they're looking for and the resources are etc. To go all the way out to fight in the ocean? With sea people? How did that make any sense? It's not like the humans decided they were gonna colonize the oceans before the lands ?! So they pretty much took all their resources to go fight to kill 1 family the bad guy has a grudge against?!. That's so idiotic! \n2.  Sully pretty much packed up his bags like a coward and tried to hideaway with the sea people. He left the Forrest clan to their own fate as there is no way him leaving would've meant they were safe and joining the sea people put the sea people at risk. Why didn't he think \"oh no the same thing is happening as before, let me lead our people against them again\" since you know - we did that in the first movie and kicked all the humans off the planet?? \n3. Them being forest people now learning to be sea people was literally a repeat of the first movie of sully learning to be a Naavi \u2026 super lazy. \n4. Why keep the bad guy alive at the end when he threatens to never stop until he kills them. - is this supposed to make me want to watch the 3rd movie? Coz it literally the same fucking plot again. Really. This megalomaniac who controls the military is obsessed with this 1 family he can't even actually think about the bloody mission?!"},{"comment":"Seen it 3 times already and could keep seeing it over and over.

Why the first whale creature attacks Jake's son is also a mystery, but he can't be saved by the other whale unless it happens so - ok.

The movie is a tour de force in computer graphics.  The animation was so real, the wife and I both had the illusion that we were watching real flesh-and-blood actors as Na'vi people.  When you wonder, \"How can Cameron ever follow up on the original Avatar?\", this movie provides a stunning answer.  In the original Avatar, the 3D at times was a bit overpowering, and one sometimes had the conscious feeling \"these characters are just animations.\"  In The Way of the Water, 3D is employed much more subtly and the CGI is so good, the \"reality\" of it all is like WOW!   The thing that drives the plot is not so much the overall good guys vs. bad guys aspect of the movie but the eternal coming-of-age problems and fitting into or rebelling against the world you're born into and the frenemies you have to live with to survive.  At least for me, after the movie, it was the character situations that stuck with me, not so much the blockbuster special effects - those serve to highlight the characters' dilemmas of choices."},{"comment":"Exciting, beautiful, and moving.

Avatar 2 is basically a fantasy SeaWorld performance mixed with Evil Humans and Their Guns\u2122. Through some biological genetic engineering BS, your favorite villains are back, Sully has a whole flock of kids with easily forgettable names, and a whole new digital playground to do their Xena war chants in. The concept of the new N'avi (I forget their names, so I'll just call the the sea people) is actually pretty cool. I like the differences in biology they have from the forest N'avi. The concept of the hyper-intelligent whales with the four eyes being \"spirit sisters\/brothers\" is also really fun and a nice twist, and they're integrated pretty well into the story, both the sea people and the whales. Jake Sully really gives off Mel Gibson in Braveheart vibes to me here, and I can't be the only one who thinks that. \n\nSome of the performances via the digital skin-suits are actually quite moving, and though I didn't see it in 3D, I could really tell the technology has been improved. I won't spoil it, but some of the sequences between the Sully clan really had me tearing up a bit. The idea of Kiri (who's the only kid's name I can remember) being essentially Grace's spiritual successor is kind of strange, but also fairly intriguing. \n\nI will use this to segway into some plot holes I saw. First off, who IS the father? It's hinted at in the movie but never said (maybe next film?). Also, why can the sea people speak the same N'avi language as the forest N'avi, despite living hundreds of miles away in an isolated island chain? Aren't there dialects on this moon? And why do they all suddenly start speaking ENGLISH of all things after a few introductory scenes in N'avi? Why would any of the sea people speak English? In addition, how can the N'avi communicate with the whales, exactly? Do they understand each other's language, or is it a telepathic thing? It's never explained. Also (and kind of spoiler alert), why exactly does Kiri seize up when she's connected to the spirit tree? So the humans say it's epilepsy, but it's never confirmed or expanded upon or used anywhere else in the film. Just a red herring kind of left to die. And exactly WHEN did that rogue whale get attacked by the humans anyway? The harpoon in its fin is rusted, so I assume a long time ago, but the humans have only been back on Pandora for a few months(?) in the film.\n\nI don't know where else to put this, so I'll add here that I felt like a lot of the extended underwater effects sequences were grandstanding on Cameron's part, showing us the new tech demo reel for almost half an hour at some points (felt like, at least) without really advancing the plot very much. Yes, we get it, your world is very pretty. Can we move on now? It felt like showing off for the sake of showing off.\n\nI did love the new characters, the kids, the sea N'avi (the hot little daughter, ahem), and they made the teenagers feel like teenagers. Some got a fair amount of fleshing out, but some didn't get much time to shine. The whale characters were nice touches (as I've said), but honestly it's hard to relate on an emotional level to something that only bellows and grunts for language, and looks at your longingly with one of its four eyes.\n\nThe way the movie finishes is also kind of disappointing. It was quite epic, as Cameron is known for, but also fairly predictable. But without spoiling I WILL say they are clearly setting the series up for the third movie with a few key plot points at the end, and it frustrated me. Why that way? Just be done with it and move on. Overall, however, I had a lot of fun. It was not quite the magic that the first movie had in 2009, even with the expanded runtime and better scenery. I've seen many of these concepts already 13 years ago, and it's not quite as fresh and mind-blowing for me the second time around. It was fun enough, though, that I probably would see it a second time. Not the deepest or most complex story in fantasy, but it expands the world very well, and even tells some (rather not-so-subtle) earth-first parables that we as humans should start paying attention to."},{"comment":"Great cinematography and graphics, but story line was a little disappointing.

I considered \"Best Picture\" to be a legit bar to measure the value of a movie, until this year, when they nominated Avatar 2.  Tonight, to keep my best picture watching intact, I sat through Avatar 2's over 3 hours run time, and my objective opinion is:  \"it was a giant waste of my time watching this ginormous piece of excrement.\"  I saw the original years ago in the theater and the total of what I remember is \"blue people\" and \"the special effects were nice\".  I never once thought, \"why didn't they make Avatar 2?\" And after sitting in the theater for well over 3 hours, I am just irked at Hollywood for their senseless nomination of a bloated, violent, and pointless, film that burgeons audiences with the theme  that the is US military are violent, imperialist a-holes with a side idiot Kiwis joining in.  Any opportunity you of a meaningful story was missed when the captive audiences start looking at their watches 45 mins in to see how much more they have to sit through, since their butts and attention span are already at their limit.  Pandering to James Cameron's arrogance to make movie that no one needed and cost 1\/2 a billion dollars to make just shows how little Hollywood actually cares about film quality or the intelligence of their audiences.  And due to this lapse in reasonable judgement of the academy, I have now changed my best picture watching quest rules to explicitly exclude ever watching any film James Cameron makes again, and will Riley question what Hollywood considers \"quality\" going forward."},{"comment":"Loved it. 3D 4DX was awesome"},{"comment":"Absolutely amazing in IMAX 3D, wouldn\u2019t have changed that decision whatsoever.

If it wasn't one of the prettiest movies I've seen I might have walked out. Seems like since they couldn't rip off the Ferngully plot again they had no ideas to work with. Literally every turn of the story relied on either the kids, or someone supposedly smart, doing something dumb... again. And for *no real reason* other than the story needed to f'ing move eventually. And then when they do, the badguys literally pop out from around a corner in the opposite direction they were previously at.\nSpeaking of... The main bad guys were the dumbest handwave retcon I've ever seen and it only added to the story once. For a short moment. And then they literally move the story to another continent. It served no purpose other than to ... I dunno? Be cool? Not have to rehash the robot thing from the last movie? It was dumb.\nThey let a captive enemy combatant just roam around wherever he wanted and do whatever he wanted.\nPlus, why the random toxic masculinity out of the main character? You immediately knew he was going to say or do something cringy when he ramped up the fake Jersey accent.\n\nAnd then the ending battle sequence... WHERE THE F- DID THE VILLAGE ARMY JUST DISAPPEAR TO!??! Seriously. They're fighting and the fight's not over and they're winning and then *poof* they're just gone and there's no one there but the family and BBEG.\nAnd why did Spider save the BBEG at the end?

I am surprised by the splats from some of the professional \"critics\". There appears to be such a sentiment against any \"franchise\" film, or \"blockbuster\". Wasn't the whole idea at one time to go to the movies to be entertained. To be \"taken away\" and escape. Sure, lash out at the countless awful, poorly thought-out films that are nothing but a dispassionate cash-grab. Those movies where the few best lines, or best action sequences have to be put into the trailer, just to get you in the door and empty your pocket.\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water, is no such ruse. The movie is simply stunning in its detail and ability to take the viewer to literally another world. Not since I was 13, and saw Star Wars in 1977, have I been so amazed by what I saw on a screen. The movie is as transformative as that blockbuster, and will again reset the bar for how movies will be made. There is a richness, and reality to James Cameron's world that simply has to be seen. It cannot translate the same way on your 60 inch TV on a streaming service. The story is relevant and worth telling thought the lens of this far-away world. Sure, the narrative has been told, like any story, in some form previously. \"Dances with Wolves\" was a masterpiece. But plenty of people have not seen that story from 30 years ago. Avatar certainly borrows similar ideas. But wow, what a way to remaster an important story. I didn't have a sense of time during this film. I couldn't believe that the 3 hr 12 min ride had expired. The technology and ability to but the viewer into the ocean - phenomenal. The years of work and passion on this film show. The acting and cast is excellent. The direction, honestly hard to conceive of the vision James had to pull this off. When you understand that all of the underwater scenes where actually captured underwater so that the motion you see is real. It makes sense why this world is so absolutely convincing. You will never fall for another actor hanging on wires (Aquaman) pretending to be underwater in a movie. This is $12 WELL spent.

Instead he goes at it alone with Neytiri, which allows the soldiers to get away and prolongs the conflict.\n\n The entire premise of the movie is also baffling as Jake decides to leave his tribe who he spent the entire first movie fighting beside and instead brings war and suffering to peaceful communities who get put to the torch for this one man. The fact that Jake is being put first over entire communities of peaceful people is very upsetting to watch. This movie depicts the suffering of indigenous people seemingly for the audience to become invested in the story. Yet there are hardly any actual indigenous people including M\u0101ori people that the water tribe are based off of in both the cast and crew of this film production. This film depicts indigenous people fictionally but ignores the real life people that they are based on."},{"comment":"Avatar 2 had multiple references to Indigenous cultures from the mannerisms to the association with whales and the facial tattoos, to say that it was purely fictional would be incorrect. Although research may have been done, it should be checked by multiple consultants to ensure there's no exploitation and disrespect. I'm sure this can all be attainable considering how much effort is placed into the accuracy of the CGI work. That same dedication can be placed on the inclusion of culture on and behind the screen."},{"comment":"The CGI was exceptional and felt realistic, which made each scene that much more captivating. I appreciate the thought put into small details to make the movie that much more natural and emotional. The war scenes of everything on fire, the whales being poached, and the ocean being ruined by the colonization of the \"sky people\" are representative of things that happen throughout our history. Inventing the Na'vi language was impressive and made it so the movie wasn't appropriating.\n\nI would argue that the actors cast to play the indigenous people of Pandora, should also be native or indigenous, and not white. I couldn't understand why some of the characters spoke with an accent while some spoke with perfect English, despite the characters all growing up together speaking the same language. I wish the idea of poaching wasn't also just tossed into the story in a throw-away scene. It would have been more impactful to have either touched on it more or left it out completely. I felt like the story was recycled from the first movie and if it was given as much thought as the CGI and visuals, it would have been a top-tier movie.\n\nI do realize that the whole meaning of the film is to show how bad humanity can be and how we can steal culture and colonize lands, but there should still be structure in the story and more thought to the indigenous culture."},{"comment":"To James Cameron: Many people have been appreciative of the work that you have created and is very evident as it is one of the best-selling films of all time. The film is absolutely gorgeous and is incredible in terms of cinematics. With that being said, many have concluded that the ideas you have formulated are derivative of pre-existing Indigenous cultures, especially the Maori culture. Whether this may have been your intention or not, the criticisms have already been made and it may be in your best interest to try and avoid the recurrence of these critiques moving forward. While the story of the Navi people is not necessarily Indigenous as they are about a group of alien beings who simply do not exist, there are many influences that are apparent in their nature. It would be nice to further nurture such influences if they were directly gathered from more Indigenous people who were featured in the making of these films."},{"comment":"I thought that the film was a very amazing experience on the first watch-through. After seeing the first Avatar film, it's safe to say that Cameron took the effects and visuals to the next level in The Way of the Water. Even with the film's 3-hour runtime, it is clear how much effort he, the cast, and the studio poured in to making the film a reality. While Cameron did strive for maximum authenticity, however, my critique would lie in his representation of other cultures. Even though Pandora is a made-up world, the Polynesian cultures that he pulls from to make the Water Na'vi people can be seen as inauthentic, or even appropriated by some. Given that the writing team had very little representation of those with a Polynesian\/Pacific background, it can give the film a skewed view of a very rich, diverse culture. Although the film is still fantasy at the end of the day, I believe that Avatar 2 would have been greatly enhanced if the story was told through the eyes of Pacific writers and crew members, rather than from an outsider's view."},{"comment":"Dear Mr. James Cameron, I'm Zacchaeus Domingo, a young and aspiring filmmaker. I watched your Avatar Way of the Water Movie. It was Great on a technical level, the way you animated the water and characters was phenomenal. The environments were beautifully rendered, the water physics was very realistic, and the creature design was perfect. There are some criticisms of this film, especially regarding how you represented indigenous culture in the movie. You should have more than just one cultural consultant in your film, having just one isn't enough when making a feature film, especially when you pull inspiration from many different indigenous cultures. You should also not call them \"Cultural Consultants\", bump them up to Producer due to them having a say and influence in the production of the film. Don't ignore what your Cultural Consultants say to you, what they say might be very important, and even though what they say might be very limiting, you still need to hear them out due to them knowing their culture best."},{"comment":"With the release of Avatar 2: The Way of Water, I imagine there must have been a lot of excitement leading up to it as to the audience response of the sequel due to the fact that the first film was the highest grossing of all time. However, after its release, I have seen many mixed reviews regarding the cultural sensitivity of the film. After watching it myself, I noticed many positives and negatives of indigenous culture in your film. One thing I do admire about this film is recognizing that people overthrowing the indigenous land, life, and world is bad and that these things are wrong. I think recognizing that in today's day and age is very important and it is good to see that on the big screen. However along with that I notice the flip side that many people see that you pick and choose what you want to use to make your story. Many, including myself, see some of these things as very in-genuine and feel that when you pick and choose, you do so for economic benefit rather than maintaining the dignity of indigenous people and their culture. Without allowing these people to have a major say in what is being portrayed, you will continue to drive harmful views of these people to everyone around the world."},{"comment":"Dear James Cameron,\nI am a cinema arts student from the University of Hawaii tasked with analyzing your Avatar films. While discussing the first movie in class I came across a controversy on how you chose to portray native people and their culture as well as their behaviors. The issues presented are that there is not enough credit given to a specific indigenous culture that you used inspiration from but by my thinking I quite like the way you've laid out the imagery of both Avatar movies. Avatar one presents the visual representation of a white culture exploring the native culture and experiencing what it means to open the way you thought more with the feeling of invasion by the native people. \nExploring Avatar the way of water was more a native invasion of native, showing the difference in cultures and not just mashing together the idea that all indigenous people are under one umbrella. The different Avatar people have different actions and different beliefs that account for where they are located while also having the same base built on the way we act as people toward nature. It is true that your portrayal of the different cultures could have done with a bit more creative direction from inside one specific culture instead of adding many to one area for a place that is said not to have ventured away or have experienced outsiders before. The use of more indigenous actors could easily make this concept flow easier while still allowing for the merge of behaviors."},{"comment":"Dear Mr. Cameron,\n\nI am writing to you about how much Avatar has inspired me as a filmmaker. I can never forget the night my mom says she got me and her boyfriend at the time tickets to the showing of Avatar when it first came out. I remember sitting in the first row with my big old 3D glasses in a theater full of people, getting blown away by the gorgeous scenery of Pandora. I could almost feel the wing blowing on my face when Jack and Natiri glided through the air. I want to touch every interesting plant when the night falls and see the neon glow they have. I also want to have my own Avatar body and live in the giant home tree and maybe tame my first banshee. Here we are at the end of 2022, watching The Way of Water. Again, you brought me back to my 10-year-old self, filled with hope with excitement. Thank you for giving a 10-year-old boy the journey of a lifetime and the dream to become a filmmaker. \n\nSincerely,\nYixiao"},{"comment":"Regarding your second Avatar film, I have a list of pros and cons that I think your movie showcased. To begin with the pros, I appreciate that you took the effort to hire a linguistics professor to create your own language for your fictional tribe. I believe if you had chosen to use an already existing language you would have faced even more backlash from the native community. I also believe your breakthroughs with CGI are incredible. While the storyline of the second film may not have been as strong as the first, I can recognize your advances in technology. Some critics I must include your casting. It was honestly quite shocking to me to find out that the voice actors of Jake Sully's sons were white. Especially considering the heavy accents they both had. I also believe you could have hired more skilled voice actors for the children considering none of them had the same accent despite growing up together in the same tribe. It was very disappointing to me that you could not take the initiative to hire native people as your voice actors, especially due to the sheer amount of their culture you incorporated into your film. Another issue I had with your development process was the fact you barely had any native consultants on this film. As I am sure you are aware, you are a white man with no experience of native culture whatsoever. And yet you decided to take customs from many different cultures and mix them together and play it off as though it's fictional to make yourself sound better. Not only did you take these customs for your film, but you also portrayed them wrongly which is quite embarrassing for you. I believe someone with as many resources as yourself should be able to find consultants to ensure you were at least portraying these cultures in a correct manner. But I do give you credit for the storyline. It is a great concept for a film; however, I wish there were other people on your team that could have ensured this movie will be great. Disregarding the cultural aspect, the first movie was by far better. I noticed a lot in the second film that you touched on subjects that were very important but then never discussed them again. For instance, Kiri has a seizure underwater and almost dies because she asked her mom's spirit who her dad was. That was a major scene in the movie and yet the audience was made to forget about it later. I understand you will be touching on these topics later in the sequels, but it almost made no sense to bring them up now. Especially since your entire trailer began with Kiri talking about how she can hear and feel her mom's heartbeat. And yet for this film specifically that had no strong importance. It was misleading, and I believe that's why a lot of people were confused or disappointed with the actual storyline. Another issue I have with Kiri's character is the fact you reused Grace's voice actor. It made Kiri's character feel much less authentic because an old woman's voice was coming out of a child's body. It just made no sense, and it made me not enjoy the character. Was it really that difficult to find a teenage girl to fill the role? The voice actor did not even try to sound younger. Overall, the film was not bad but there were some major aspects that made me walk out of the theater feeling unsatisfied. And I believe that is why this film has rated much lower than the previous one."},{"comment":"Visuals amazing like expected, but the story was so predictable and unoriginal."},{"comment":"There's a lot of gap filling to be done since this release is 13 years after the first and plot details are lost in the years passed, but from start to finish Avatar: The Way of Water is a masterpiece and the best of 2022.

The creation of Pandora is mesmerizing and surreal yet so relevant to Earth's nature and wildlife that I really appreciate James' creativity and his long term dedication to the concept and biological coherence of the world. Beside that, the characters' depth are good and invested, the emotions are real and touching especially with Zoe's and Kate's characters. If I have to compare with recent years' formula blockbusters, Avatar is totally another level of film making and entertainment.

It's only really worth it if you see it in IMAX 3D."},{"comment":"James Cameron's \"Avatar: the Way of Water\" is an ambitious, thoughtful and suspenseful science-fiction blockbuster suggesting that filmmaking is an indispensable tool for raising awareness about global warming. With sequel, Cameron employs sci-fi spectacle to shed light on importance of building a modern-day universe that is sustainable. It's the filmmaker's first attempt to honor ecosystems in a genre world-famous for escapism rather than environmental activism, but he pulls it off successfully. Using spellbinding cinematography, Cameron immerses viewers into the world of Pandora where the ecosystem is valued rather than looked upon with stigma as in America. Evoking James Cameron's \"Titanic\", Cameron effectively uses the ocean to showcase the shipwreck repercussions of environmental destruction. Recalling Jack & Rose's maiden voyage journey on Titanic ships doomed to sinking tragedy, Jake Sully must learn to survive on oceans to save family. If \"Avatar\" took place entirely upon the confined planet of Pandora showcasing its lush rainforests, the sequel captures devastation done to the world's oceans. Cameron shows immense control over production-design, editing and music, crafting an unforgettable cinematic experience. Cameron's screenplay is also sensational, using subtle water symbolism to celebrate the world's ecosystem. One appreciates astonishing performances. Sam Worthington delivers one of his greatest career performances as Jake Sully. It isn't simple to communicate emotions underneath motion-capture makeup, but Sam succeeds tremendously. With riveting expression, he conveys bravery, determination and regrets of a protective father that strives to protect his family from environmental catastrophe. Although facial expressions of the supporting actors are hidden beneath mo-cap makeup, they excel at portraying their characters. From a technical standpoint, the film shows how far visual effects have progressed since 2009 with jaw-dropping motion-capture performances which are on par with Andy Serkis' \"Planet of the Apes\" trilogy. Although \"The Way of Water\" is a superb sequel, ultimately it can't quite capture the sense of wonder of its superior predecessor. At three hours, it suffers from a lengthy running time that tests viewers' patience. Moreover, it builds to a conventional ending that appears intended solely to setup future sequels. Nevertheless, fans of the sci-fi genre will definitely appreciate \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" and so will movie-goers seeking enjoyable entertainment. If Cinema is an art-form with the power to change attitudes towards the environment in America during the modern era, hopefully revisiting the fantastical world of Pandora in the sci-fi genre will encourage the general public to recognize the undeniable existence of climate change in a country torn apart by environmental stigma where the destinies of natural ecosystems all-too-often lie in the hands of greedy politicians elected based upon their charisma rather than talents that are driven by a political agenda."},{"comment":"just some movie effects....the story is full of prejudice and really boring!"},{"comment":"Fantastic on the big screen!"},{"comment":"This movie brought me back to the world of Avatar again.. and I found myself awed in the tech behind the visuals.. no short cuts to bring out a visual, technical masterclass film."},{"comment":"\"The most Beautiful cinematic I've ever seen\""},{"comment":"Fue una experiencia muy agradable, estuve tenso durante toda la pel\u00edcula y no se me hizo larga.

The plot of The Way Of Water is so watery I am not even going to apologize for the overly obvious nature of my pun.\n\nThis story, it's so silly, I don't even... Well, sea (ha-ha) for yourselves: so the \"Earth baddies\" return to Pandora to get Sully for treason. Sure, they let slip somewhere that they also want to do some colonizing and terraforming, but seeing that in all the 14 hours of screen time they did exactly none of that, the whole colonization thing must be just a side quest to them. Somehow Sully realizes that all the hubbub is about him personally, so he says to his wife and kids \"Hey, I got a great idea, since these angry earth dudes are after me, our presence here in this village is endangering the other other villagers, so let's all up and leave, and run and hide, and this way we shall PROTECT the village!\"\n\nAnd guess what, his suddenly spineless wife, instead of shaming her sweetheart Toruk-Makto into calling the banners on all the tribes that he'd supposedly \"unified\", after a moment's hesitation she says \"Sure, that's a splendid idea, I fully endorse it, let's do it at once.\" And they pack up out of there and leave their kindred behind for the earth baddies to stomp (because, remember - they are still colonizing the heck out of Pandora no matter what). The Sacred Tree, the ancestors' graves, their relatives who are about to get massacred: everything is abandoned -- we're running, babe! He was the Chief of the tribe, too, mind. \n\n\"When danger reared its ugly head\nHe bravely tucked his tail and fled\nBrave, brave, brave \nSir Toruk-Makto!\"\n\nSo they go and instead of settling on some distant uninhabited island where no one can find them, they join another village, so they can endanger THEM with their presence instead, which is what ultimately happens. Of course, duh!\n\nAfter about a week-and-a-half of screen time of us watching them bond with the locals (who happen to speak Sully's tribe's language, how convenient, eh) and frolic in the waves and do synchronized swimming with sea-turtles and whales, the bad humans naturally catch up with Sully in his new tribe and turn everyone's life to sh*t.  But instead of feeling an e-e-e-tsy bit annoyed with Sully's family for bringing the war with them, the water tribe is like \"Yay, what joy! You are now our BRETHREN! In fact, we are so pleased with you, why don't you stay with us forever? Here's our underwater Sacred Tree, go pigtail-copulate with it to complete the ritual!\" \n\nAND THEY DO. \n\nTHE END.\n\nYes, that is the story."},{"comment":"The high frame rate is gross.

Visuals are great and fights scenes are pretty good but everything else just kinda fell flat. Story had a lot of plot holes and some of the smart characters make incredibly stupid decisions. SPOLIERS\nOne plot hole was the whale hunting or whatever they are called. How were the able to hunt there for so long and not be a target for Jake or the other tribes. Why would the smart magical daughter take the toddler with them knowing they would most likely run into a fight for them to get hurt or captured. Another thing is the writing. It's just so bland and made me cringe so God damn much. When this gets released everything they say bro or cuz I'll take a drink and be hospitalized a quarter way through the movie. On to the villains. In the first movie it was a battle for Jake to choose between saving the humans or the Na'Vi. This made the humans the villains that you could still understand and relate too. This time the humans have made Na'Vi clones of the first evil humans and instead of having them be relatable in anyway (unless you relate to manhunting for the sake of manhunting) they are just evil. Also why did Jake and his wife run from them when they had maybe 7-10 Na'Vi soldiers max and the 2 of them took out all of them, half in the first encounter. They already couldn't be found and they were winning this Gorilla war so there was absolutely no reason for Jake to take his family and run. Anyway just a meh movie that is way too long with meh writing, meh plot, and breathtaking visuals."},{"comment":"After a long 13 years it has come! An Avatar sequel!

Could have been shorter, 3 hours is too long"},{"comment":"Avatar the Way of Water is a movie that brings you back to Pandora. The beauty and the time James Cameron took for the first movie, showing the world of wonders, can not be matched in its sequel.\n\nEven there are some moments where you see its beauty shine through the thick heavy fighting scenes, they do not amaze as in its predecessor.\nThe movie is a blend of a try-it-all, the dialogues feel forced, the storyline is thin, the acting not flawless, and above all misses the heart and soul of the characters.  Was James Sully a hero in the first, in the sequel he feels overshadowed by his younger son. Clich\u00e9's on clich\u00e9's pass the revenue. For example the sea girl and the son of sully who is struck by lightning when seeing her, falling in love immediatly, but as Sully would say fittingly about this \"Sully's stick together\"\u2026 Where have I heard that sentence before\u2026\n\nWith more than three hours you you feel moments you just wish the movie was going to bring something spectaculair and daring. For a brief moment there is the beautiful friendship of Tuljun Payakan (the sort of whale). This should have been a focus point of the movie. The developing friendship within him and Sully's son is beautiful.\nBut after this the movie just goes all directions and (spoiler alert), when the eldest son dies, you feel not the grief or sadness you should (as with the ancient tree that was knocked down). Sigourney Weaver lays all movie in a casket, even she is voicing the daughter who is a teenager and sounds like an older female. Tuk the youngest daughter is just annoying and shouldn't have made the final draft of the script at all.\n\nAll but all, the movie is okey to watch if you don't care about stories, arcs, character backgrounds or development, nor their emotions, and you like fighting and action, this movie is for you to watch.\n\nBut sadly the movie doesn't reach the highlights as in the first, and that's a pity. Especially thinking how much the costs were. With many Avatar movies to come, I wonder where it all will go and how much Pandora can take before it becomes like the Disney prequels and sequels nobody even remembers."},{"comment":"It was an okay movie and was unnecessarily long.

All they need is a script that isn't generic and a director who knows what \"acting values\" are, and they might have a motion picture on their hands.

I mean, the original was so groundbreaking.  It was so immersive, beautiful, and engaging in practically every way.  It's hard to find movies with so much CGI in it where you completely suspend your disbelief and are wholly invested in the story as it plays out.  Plus, we all remember the Jurassic Park sequels: they had a really hard time feeling fresh and different from the initial movie that made us stare in wonder at a world with dinosaurs.  I feared the same fate for this sequel, and I didn't want the first movie ruined for me.\n\nBut Avatar: The Way of Water blew all of my expectations out of the water!  It builds upon the existing world of Avatar and none of it feels stale!  It still feels like \"Avatar\"...but MORE.  I loved it!\n\nI worried about the introduction of children into the story (I don't think that's a spoiler because the previews show it) because it can be hard to get invested in CGI characters because we're kinda hard-wired to relate to other humans.  In the original movie, we were introduced to Sully as a human, so we related to him a little easier, I think.  For me, I found myself having a hard time getting emotionally invested in the CGI children.  There's one human \"child\" (he's a young adult and not really a \"child\", but...) and I found myself aligning more closely to him instead of Jake's kids.  But I didn't necessarily mind that too much and it wasn't a big distraction...and I DID end up investing somewhat in those characters, but it definitely took a little time.  It didn't help that the kids all looked the same.\n\nBut don't let that deter you from watching this movie!  I was expecting some degree of disappointment and went to the theater expecting to pick it apart and find something wrong with it.  In retrospect, I should've just enjoyed it the ride...and you should too!"},{"comment":"I Loved the first Avatar and liked this one even better.

However film is infused with combat scenes and killings, and acts of violence,  which might be somewhat sensitive to certain viewers."},{"comment":"The varying frame rate \"feature\" ruined the movie. I found the changes in frame rate between scenes jarring and unnecessary (a little judder is okay) while making the movie appear cobbled together from an actual film and video game cut scenes. The 3D appeared blurry at times and combined with the 4DX seat movement the headache inducing scenes of the movie unfortunately outnumbered the scenes where the experience was actually enhanced.

Although in some ways The story was beat for beat the same v as the first I found it moved much better.  It also had at least 3 layers going on instead of one:  family dynamics,  tribal dynamic,  and bad guy dynamics.  And the water aspect is flat out spectacular.  Action sequences are thrilling.  More character development though stereotypical."},{"comment":"It is a very good sequel and doesn't waste time reliving the 1st movie, but jumps in knowing the viewer already knows the story. The basic story line is nothing new: good guys are stalked and persecuted by bad guy. They must flee to protect those around them.

I was especially loved all of the new characters, including Jake's sons Lo'ak and Netayam, and I was thrilled to see Quaritch's return in a recom body . The soundtrack for this movie is incredible, blending both intense songs with emotionally moving pieces. The actors' performances were nothing short of mind-blowing, delivering a perfect balance of emotion. The visual effects speak for themselves, making this film arguably the best-looking one to date.

The 3 hour run time wasn't due to a story that took 3 hours to tell.  It was because Cameron doesn't know how to edit.

What a shame. This came from James Cameron who directed \u2018The Abyss' which was so good. The aqua scenes were visually attractive, but I'm afraid that was it. The script was very poor with lots of flaws which undermined the film's credibility. The movie too was populated with simplistic stereotypes.  There was one particularly worrying moment - the lead character at one point said to his son \u2018Don't make me come over there'. That is a threat of violence and that is abuse. I'm surprised they got that one passed the censors. And the film is also very, very long\u2026.."},{"comment":"Exact same plot as first ill, but in water.

Long long long, 7 or 8 plot lines. The total 1.5 hours in the middle is 100% unnecessary. I'm actually outside of the theater now in the last hour of this monstrosity. I dread returning to finish this thing. Nearly 3.20 hours of visuals without substance: it's like Cameron is trying to cram three movies into one as usual.

It is an exciting and totally new technique \n   As a scuba diver, the theme of an action - villain human \/ hero alien love story, set in an underwater environment, was so realistic that I found myself breathing and moving with the characters on screen.  This movie should attract a lot of people to at least try scuba diving, and experiencing a completely new world, right here on earth.

The movie paces well for being over three hours long. It's quite obvious the producers expected most people (adults at least) to have seen the previous movie and the family\/kid element was introduced for the younger crowd - this left the plot and dialogue a little bland.  When you're trying to get \"everybody\" to like it, you basically have to add everything, and they did just that. I'm definitely looking forward to \"making of\" featurettes when the movie is released for home viewing."},{"comment":"The water & creatures are so realistic you'd think you're watching national geographic!\nSolid story line, awesome future tech, and enough action to keep it going. Great movie!"},{"comment":"James Cameron makes a triumphant return with the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 box office hit, Avatar. The biggest problem this film faced was the significant time jump between release dates, however, Cameron managed to maneuver around this, creating a captivating story that left plenty of room for further developments. Unlike the first film, this one focused heavily on emotions and familial relationships. It created the bond that so many of us long for when it comes to friends and family, and it made the events of the film a little more harrowing as they established very quickly that nobody is safe. Much like the first film, this one continued the storyline of environmentalism and colonization, effectively putting the audience in a place that has them rooting on the side of the Na'vi \u2013 and against their own people. \n\nIn order to tell this story in the manner that was intended, Cameron waited until he had the technology available to create an immersive world for his audience. Especially with the use of IMAX and 3D effects, the viewer can feel transported to Pandora for the full length of the film, and will grow to miss this universe when the credits roll and the screen fades to black. The CGI for this film was masterful in every way and it can be difficult to find a cast that possesses the talent to perform with the technology that will assist in building this world. That being said, casting director, Margery Simkin, could not have done a better job. While the entire cast provided wonderful performances, Zoe Saldana (Neytiri) stood out with her emotional performance as not only a warrior, but a mother and wife as well. It was refreshing to see that, although she has different priorities now, she still held on to her values and beliefs in the same manner as the first film. \n\nThe only thing that I felt this film lacked was a memorable soundtrack, as it seemed to blend in to the background of the film and was not as noticeable to me. However, this is not always a bad thing. It was still an important aspect in creating the desired atmosphere, and it did not overshadow the incredible action sequences that appeared throughout the entire film. \n\nWith perfect pacing on a three-hour story that left me wanting more, it comes as no surprise that this film is quickly approaching the coveted $2 billion box office mark that very few films have seen \u2013 one of those being its predecessor, and another being Titanic (1997), all with the same director. Whether you are a fan of the franchise, director, actors, or just mildly interested in the story, I recommend seeing this film in theaters as it is a heartwarming and thought-provoking experience that is sure to make you excited for the third film."},{"comment":"light entertainment.
