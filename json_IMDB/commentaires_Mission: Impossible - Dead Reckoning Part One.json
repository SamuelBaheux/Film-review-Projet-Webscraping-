    "0": "Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!",
    "1": "Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.",
    "2": "Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",
    "3": "Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",
    "4": "The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling \"entity\" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now. I'll catch MI: Dead Reckoning Part 2 at home on Paramount-plus when it streams at no cost.",
    "5": "I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",
    "6": "Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",
    "7": "There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in \"Goldeneye\".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally \"Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time\". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",
    "8": "'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",
    "9": "Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.",
    "10": "No one liked my indy review, so they're really gonna hate this. Its long. Long. Long. Even tom looked bored. It could have been the botox. But i doubt it. Something about a key to world domination. Did i mention the key. You'll be sick of it after almost three hours. Pegg and rhames are barely in this one. Maybe they'll have more action in part deux. I can't image another two plus hours of this, but hey. They don't pay me 20 million. You've literally seen all this before and if you haven't, they do all of it at least twice. I think the 20 minute car chase in the middle of rome was supposed to be funny. It wasn't. Did i mention the key. Oh brother.",
    "11": "Probably the worst one in the series in my opinion.All because of the characterization of \"Gracie\" by Hayley. The movie's lion share goes like this, Ethan rescues gracie, she escapes, he rescues her again, she escapes, again and again till the climax. At some point I got so frustrated that I almost forgot this movie has a mission. Plus its a part one hence the climax havent completed the story yet. Some of the fights are good but not upto the previous ones, Especially the train-bridge collapse escape, with after 5 minutes it was boring. Also the character gracie is a mastermind in pickpocketing and picking locks, in all the movie , she just simply escapes by picking lock however at the end in the train she just cant open a locked door hence goes for otherway around.Adding to this she being the reason for the death of IIsa , just after 1 minute of sad face the team quickly forgets that and started throwing quircky and funny punch dialogues which felt very inappropriate after all of those emotional scene by Ethan\nLets wait for the part 2 however I dont have much hope in story and screenplay\nFrom this I can say good to bad films as per my view below.MI 2\nMI 3\nMI 1\nMI Rogue Nation\nMI Ghost Protocol\nMI Fall Out\nand Finally the least favorite\nMI Dead Reckoning Part 1.",
    "12": "Tom Cruise amazing as usual. The action scenes are top notch. The third act feels like MI standards. That being said...What a disappointment after MI: Fallout, this just feels like a step back. I cant even say \"lazy writing\", its just too simple, unoriginal and almost old fashioned. \"The entity\" is a bunch of noise lines in a screen, REALLY? Grace is an annoying but beautiful princess in distress, REALLY? Gabriel is an old T-1000 that feels cringe in his every moves, REALLY? The weird blonde bounty hunter changes all her life motivations because Ethan doesnt kill her, REALLY? I mean this are just some examples, its bad.I really hope the second part steps up because we wont have Tom a cruise forever.",
    "13": "The film was absolute garbage. Suuuper long camera-zoomed-in-face dialogues over explaining stupid phrases that nobody cared about. Also seemed done in a way that told me for most of the filming process, most actors weren't even in the same room, but were added together in post. Had the worst new characters in the series to date. It was 2.5 hrs of people shouting \"where is the key?\" And \"(enter pronoun) has the key!\" with some cheap pickpocketing over and over again. Lacked everything magical and technologically fantastical about the last 6 films. Producers had to have gone with about 75% of budget on CGI, 15% on actor comp, and 5% on writing. If you noticed those percentages didn't add up to one hundred, then you'll have also noticed that the film was also cut short of being a good film. So needless to say, the writing was poopy, absent, or uninteresting.",
    "14": "I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.",
    "15": "So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.",
    "16": "This movie is a remarkable collection of action movie cliches.Right off the bat the movie smacks you in the face with the age-old Russians cliche with a bunch of guys speaking English (?) with a ridiculous russian accent.The cliches continue, with virtually ALL the characters explaining the plot in cringey, dramatic half-whispering voices.The Entity, the main villain of the film reminds me a lot of early 2000s sci-fi/action flicks, trying to imagine an AI going out of control. Given that it's 2020s, they had an amazing opportunity to explore the topic of AI in much more detail and way more realistically. But they didn't. The whole AI story just falls flat on it's face and the only plausible reaction of the audience to that is a condescending smirk.Something must've happened with the sound recording, because the dialogue sounds extremely isolated and unnatural with no room sound whatsoever. Perhaps they had to do some heavy de-noising.The acting is meh, the music is meh, even the stunts felt underwhelming. This part seems weaker than most of the previous ones.",
    "17": "Boring dialogue, incredibly tedious and terrible exposition, too many characters, killing off a central character and moving away from the central IMF team are all fatal mistakes that make for the weakest movie in the franchise. I cannot for the life of me even slightly understand how anyone thought this story was a good idea. A convoluted plot, sloppy characterization all add to its downfall. I always thought MI was superior to James Bond in terms of fight choreography, gadgets and characters, but I stand corrected. I am so disappointed. I had to laugh for most of the movie because the scenes were just so ridiculous and cringey.",
    "18": "It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.",
    "19": "The story:\nSomeone made a super virus. The super virus has free will and can hack anything. Not stupid enough? The virus found an AI on the web and became self conscious.

(why don't they get the same programmers that made it to stop it?

(this has no bearing on how programming works. You're thinking too much) (why don't they just open the Vault without the key? You're thinking too much YTTM)\nEvery government wants to control it, because that would allow them to control every technological system in the world, but they only send less then 50 people to deal with it.

One where things explode? Obviously. How about disarming a bomb? Yes. A car chase? Check. Dealing with heights? Check. Getting orders from a friend in a walkie talkie about the direction he must run?

YTTM!)\nOkay let's backtrack a bit, those keys, where did they come from? There was a Russian submarine, which had two people in it that were wearing the keys in necklaces, so the virus created the illusion that another submarine was attacking it, then that the submarine was going to hit it, then it rerouted the real submarine's missile back to the submarine, and exploded the submarine. And so the two people died, but didn't get destroyed, nor were the keys destroyed, nor did the keys sink to the bottom of the ocean, and their bodies floated, and two different groups got the keys. (WTF?! YTTM!)",
    "20": "Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.",
    "21": "What can I say, this movie starts and doesn't stop. The action pieces are breathtaking. Camerawork is brutal. The story is good and actually scary; it works, and it isn't convoluted either, especially considering the villain. They set the piece, then they execute on it. Sure, Fallout had more actual spy craft, this is more Hobbs & Shaw, but if Hobbs & Shaw was brilliant & inventive.I can't wait to see the sequel, they made the setup worth it and paid off everything well. I might see some flaws on second watch but this is a great movie, and I'm not even the franchise's biggest fan. It just gets better and better.Pom Klementieff really surprised me. Need to see more of her. That alleyway fight is a masterpiece.",
    "22": "I loved Fallout (10/10!) so I was excited for this movie. And I must say I'm disappointed by the overuse of deus ex machina as a scriptwriting trope. I'm still trying to head-canon a few instances to somehow believe what happened, and of course that repeatedly pulled me out of the story.I'm not going to rate this until I see the rest of the movie, to be fair, as this was only Part One. I'm interested in what happens, and I'm sure I'll catch more upon rewatching. But sometimes it felt like the script itself was written by an AI, and I found viewing to be a frustrating experience. Way too much deus ex machina.",
    "23": "Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.",

    "25": "There's no denying Cruise has the most exorbitant amazing actions scenes in films, and this one continues that tradition, and even elevates it. Most of the action looks and feels real, and for the most part is plausible and doesn't defy the laws of physics, unlike the ridonkulousness of Fast X.However the writing wasn't as desirable compared to previous installments. There wasn't enough substance to effectively fill in the bloated 163 min runtime, especially when it's only half the story and we have to wait another year for the final half. It's deflating to get to the end of this film's runtime and hear the words \"this is only the beginning\". The story itself had many long dragged out scenes, plot holes, and subplots that weren't really necessary, and if anything, convoluted the narrative. Then adding a love triangle to kill-off one character and add a new love interest was a little cheesy and unnecessary. They should've kept Rebecca Ferguson in the entire film, especially after investing in her character the previous installments. Throwing in a pick-pocket and calling her an IMF agent going into such a huge and serious mission with zero training, is worthy of eye-rolls.Had this film been trimmed down at least 40 mins, or preferably, edited out the filler and used the full runtime so there's no part 2, this could've easily been a 10/10 from me. Nevertheless, a great action film that has to be enjoyed on the biggest screen with the best sound.",
    "26": "Greetings from Lithuania.I enjoyed mostly of \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" due to its actors, action set piece at the end and some dialogs here and there. But as a whole i was a bit disappointed. The main issue with this movie i found in its plot. I mean \"we have been there and done that\" type of story - nothing new or original. And it just felt like this series might be running out its steam. If next instalment is going to be last one as they say, it might have been a very wise decision.Overall, latest \"Mission: Impossible\" movie is a great looking but plot wise paper thin action, adventure movie. The problem is that this story has been done already many times, and it felt like another \"McGuffin\" to be chased after. Hope they will be more original in Part 2.",
    "27": "My wife is a big Tom Cruise fan, so we went to see this movie as part of her birthday celebration. I don't get the hype. The plot felt very forced to me with contrivances and bizarre explanations for things rather than true exposition and plot development just to be able to get to an action sequence. The action sequences also felt very stale as we have seen people running on trains and car chases through European streets many times in the past. The storyline was also very convoluted. Overall, I did not find this one very interesting. While my wife is looking forward to the second part, I will go just to support her but I'm really not that interested in what happens next.",
    "28": "Full disclosure, Tom Cruise is my all-time favorite actor. He's displayed a range and diversity in both roles and films his acting career more so than some of the most acclaimed actors. Prior to 2010, Cruise was one of the most unique actors in history constantly challenging himself and pushing the envelope from an ACTING standpoint! But post-2010, he's been almost solely dedicated to doing Mission Impossible sequels. And despite the insane popularity and financial success of this franchise starting with the 4th MI film Ghost Protocol and beyond, as far as Tom Cruise's acting career, I think he's done himself a major disservice. He's too good to only be doing MI sequels, especially at a stage in his life where his age is catching up to him. I noticed in this 7th franchise film MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE-DEAD RECKONING PART ONE (2023), there were a ton of scenes that Cruise himself wasn't in. It got to a point when a long scene would go on without Cruise and then it would get back to his character Ethan Hunt I would go \"Oh, right, I forgot that Tom Cruise was in this movie!\" LOL Another caveat I must mention before I get into my actual review of this film is that I still believe the first MI film from 1996, which was directed by the great Brian DePalma, is the best MI film even now. All of these sequels can have all of these amazing stunts and pseudo-labyrinthine plots and mercurial villains, but there's something incredibly soulless about all of the MI sequels, with this one being no exception and quite possibly a contender for worst of the franchise, even worse than the atrocious MI2 from 2000. The first MI '96 had heart. It was a tight, tense, claustrophobic, fast-paced, superbly acted, and brilliantly directed spy thriller that I can re-watch and find new things to love about it. None of the sequels remotely match the originality or brilliance of MI1. The sequels, while most of them are good movies, all feel like interchangeable cash grabs that throw in all these new random characters played by big name actors and a bunch of cringe, cheeky dialogue reminiscent of the dialogue found in like every other movie made since 2010. The first MI had a dramatic weight and seriousness that these sequels lack, in my opinion. But I guess I'm in the minority on this.The first 30 minutes of this film was an absolute CHORE to get through! This movie starts off with a scene of pure exposition on a Russian sub with all the characters spoon-feeding details to the viewers. It's all tell and no show. The next scene is just as bad with even more exposition. All of the heads of the U. S. security agencies are gathered together in a room spoon-feeding the film's plot to the Head of National Security (played by Cary Elwes). I found myself sighing and yawning the whole time. The climax of this tedious scene was a reunion between Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and CIA Director Eugene Kittridge (reprised by. Henry Czerny from the first movie). I remember from the trailers being excited by Kittridge's return to the franchise, but this movie was so long and bad that it killed my enthusiasm. The fact that the bad guy of this film is AI is just plain laughable. The villain in this movie is called \"The Entity\" and it's basically gathering all of the information from every person on the planet and calculating their every move. So this movie is basically the same plot as Season 3 of Westworld, and Season 3 of Westworld was terrible. Get the idea? I literally laughed out loud at the big Venice party meeting scene between all the major players when the bad guy Gabriel (played by Esai Morales) revealed that the Entity was overhead looking at them. How did the MI franchise fall so low? Also, this scene was also nothing but exposition much like the early part of the movie. Actually this scene still counts as early since the movie was almost 3 hours long! The entire movie just felt like a long information dump instead of natural dialogue between characters.The character work in this movie was baseless and one-dimensional. None of the characters in this movie left an impression for me. I felt so sad watching the first scene of Ethan, Luther (reprised by Ving Rhames), and Benji (reprised by Simon Pegg) together in yet another spoon-feeding dialogue scene. The trio looked so worn down and way past their primes. The fact that the movie had a lot of scenes that sidelined these older actors and had Luther and Benji sitting down most of the time told me all I needed to know. Cruise looked like he gave it his all with various running scenes (can't have a Tom Cruise movie without him running at some point), but it was painfully obvious that his age is finally catching up to him. The fight scenes looked terrible and uninspired, with characters flailing their arms and not simply going for the kill immediately. It was like watching a lightsaber duel in a Disney Star Wars show. Back to the characters, this film introduced a new one Grace (played by Hayley Atwell), who was supposedly a master thief that was key to the plot because she was hired to steal one half of the key that when put together with it's mate would control the Entity giving it's owner the power to dominate the world. The movie wanted the viewer to actually believe that Ethan cared as much about Grace, a girl he literally jlust met, as he did about Ilsa (reprised by Rebecca Ferguson), a woman he fell in love with like 3 movies ago! When Gabriel gave his condition that either Grace or Ilsa must die as a condition for The White Widow (reprised by Vanessa Kirby) getting the full key so she could broker her deal, I was like that's not even a choice! Ethan has no past or history with Grace. Why not make the choice more feasible, like between Ilsa and Luthor, or Ilsa and Benji, or Luther and Benji? Why should anyone care about Grace? Then there was the cliche scene of Ethan sparing the life of Gabriel's female goon (played by Pom Klementieff). First, I was like why didn't Ethan kill her? Then I realized I guess the director thought it would make him look bad killing a female. But this lady was trying to kill him and is working with the main villain. She's a legit threat to the lives of innocent people. I knew that Ethan sparing her would come back in some way and of course it did with her saving him and Grace's life on the train. This is one of the most predictable and cliche setups and it ends with the cliche of the redeemed girl asking Ethan why he saved her. The movie's train climax also had a completely filler scene between the main 2 IMF guys after Ethan on the train discussing Ethan's motives. And it's really obvious that the IMF guy who felt the girl's pulse and her are going to be a thing in Part 2.The action scenes in this movie somehow looked cheaper and more fake to me than in some of the more recent sequels. Like, I could always tell they were staged. The big early car chase scene was too long and boring. Already mentioned how bad the fight scenes looked. And on top of that, most of these characters didn't look like they could fight. Morales looked bad in his fights with Ferguson and Cruise. How he took down Ilsa is a mystery other than the plot needed her to die so Grace could be her replacement. Ilsa took out that guy twice her size the Rogue Nation climax only to fall to a guy she should have taken out easily in this movie. Then the movie totally violates it's own universe with unrealistic fights on top of the speeding train in this movie versus that phenomenal train sequence from the '96 film. Somehow, Ethan and Gabriel can keep their footing and engage in a full on fight on top of a moving train with the wind blowing and everything, while the finale of the '96 movie had the characters realistically holding on for dear life and not being able to even stand up. Then somehow, Ethan and Benji are the ONLY two people driving on the roads in the middle of the day as Benji was navigating Ethan on how to get on the train. There were never any other cars around at all. Grace didn't look like a fighter at all yet she held her own for long stretches until someone intervened to save her when she should have been taken out way earlier.This film suffers from having way too much padding. Unnecessarily long scenes of characters feeding the plot to the viewer throughout the film's runtime. Too much cringe humor. Absolutely no chemistry between Ethan and Grace. Terrible and forgettable villains. Tedious action scenes with a lot of obvious CGI. Long standing characters looking ragged and bored. I'm at a point where I simply have MI fatigue and as much as I'm not a fan of the MI sequels in general, even I could totally tell that this movie Dead Reckoning Part 1 is nowhere near as good as MI3, Ghost Protocol, Rogue Nation, or Fallout. The only sequel Dead Reckoning Part 1 may exceed in the franchise is MI2, which is not saying much as that movie is terrible. Obviously, there will be a Dead Reckoning Part 2 and my hope is that it will be the last film of this franchise, mostly because I want to see Tom Cruise going back to being an actor instead of playing action hero.",
    "29": "Mission: Impossible - Fallout is one of my favorite movies of all time. I will never forget watching it in theaters for the first time. I love all the movies and the overarching storyline.But with Dead Reckoning Part 1, I'm just confused now. Why are these next two movies being made? It doesn't have anything to do with the previous films, so it feels like everything we previously saw means nothing. Sure, they mention a few names from last time, but the 4th movie directly affected the events in 5, and capturing Solomon Lane directly affected the events in 6. But here, there's basically nothing except for the White Widow returning. This feels more like a glorified spin-off with Ethan Hunt than a full sequel.I am fully aware this is the first half. I love me a good cliff hanger. As long as it's done correctly... but this isn't. The movie literally just stops abruptly and thinks that having a monologue with music is a good outro. It's not. There's no big reveal at the end to make you excited for what comes next. No surprises, no characters returning out of the blue, nothing. When Dead Man's Chest ended, Barbossa coming back from the dead was extremely cool. And it was built up from the beginning. But here, the movie just stops. Not cool.But what about the action scenes? They unfortunately leave a lot to be desired. They hyped up that motorcycle jump to ABSOLUTE DEATH... and in the movie we get to see it for a whopping four seconds. FOUR!!!!!!! I don't care if he did the jump himself. It doesn't feel like it when you cut it so hard and only show me a small part of it! The Halo jump in Fallout was so great because it was all one cut. That showed that they really did risk life and limb for this stuff. Same with Tom on the outside of the plane in Rogue Nation. We got to see that happen in real time for at least 10-20 seconds. But they just gloss over this so hard in Dead Reckoning... WHY?????The pacing is absolutely atrocious. The reason why Fallout and Rogue Nation were amazing is because they trimmed the fat and cut to the chase... literally! Those movies had a lot going on, but they got straight to the point. In this movie? There isn't a lot going on, but it's the longest of the movies so far. So we have overly long sections of people talking about nothing and extended scenes of people staring or spouting what's going to happen before it happens. It's lame. The dialogue in Fallout beats the dialogue in this 500 times over.We have literally no idea who Gabriel is. The actor who plays him isn't menacing or stoic at all. And the movie chooses not to tell us anything about him outside from the fact that he killed a girl when Ethan was younger. HOW DOES THAT MAKE HIM MORE EVIL THAN SOLOMON LANE???? Solomon Lane was going to detonate 2 nukes in the middle of Kashmir in the name of creating world peace, and you expect us to believe this motiveless brick of a person named Gabriel to be even more evil? Without giving us any reason to do so????Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't entirely bad. But much like The Dark Knight Rises, it's hard to appreciate it when there's so much wrong with the movie. I haven't even gotten into Grace joining the IMF, Kitridge returning, Ilsa dying in the most emotionless way possible, it goes on.I'm not mad (well, maybe a little). I'm just confused. After the masterpieces that were Rogue Nation and Fallout, we were all hoping that Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise would just knock it out of the park. But that hasn't happened yet. We'll find out next year if they did or not. That's what frustrates me the most.",
    "30": "Special effects star in this \"action picture.\" Luckily, I saw it in XD, with reclining seats, needed to get through the 163 minutes and that enabled my eyelids to droop occasionally, until I was jarred into attention by loud noises on the sound track, that caused the chair to vibrate a little: you have to watch it, like it or not. As I was leaving, I engaged a middle-aged couple with the question, \"Would you like to see this movie again?\" \"Oh, yes,\" was the reply from the lady. I mentioned that I had no idea what was going on and she explained that there are seven in the series and you have to see all of them. According to the end credits, nearly everyone on the planet helped make this show and that deserves a few stars for organization alone. The chase scenes are well done. And the climactic scene is memorable.",
    "31": "This franchise has been amazing to follow and each movie was better than the last, but this penultimate instalment? I'm sorry, they got it wrong. Can't win them all. Fallout was a tough act to follow. I thought this movie would deliver, but it just didn't. And that's ok. That's life.Too much ceremony and really forced emotional depth. It didn't feel natural. Felt very staged. The camaraderie and character development of each team member is usually flawless and weaves smoothly in and out the story. This time, it seemed forced and 3 hours was indulgent.Of course the car chase scenes, the motorbike stunt and the train scene were amazeballs. The locations were spectacular.The way they killed off Rebecca Ferguson's character was so haphazard. She deserved a better send off than that.Did not feel like much was at stake with the villain. He didn't seem like a real threat. Or maybe his full identity needs to be unfolded more. I think Solomon Lane was a much better villain.The AI concept was clever but it was told in a too convoluted way. Just felt like it could have been simpler. The riddle and bomb scene was really good suspense. And you felt the pain because we all love Benji.Ok that's enough. I may be the only person who thinks this movie was average. It got such high praise.",
    "32": "The Mission Impossible series of films has been one the best things about mainstream cinema in recent years, inventive and full of interesting, gripping storylines and characters. This one just falls flat; the long exposition of the big bad AI and it's human face Gabriel is drawn out and confusing. What could have been an interesting premise somehow just doesn't work and Gabriel is a weak villain with a tacked on back story.The supporting cast are given too little to do. Newcomer Hayley Atwell does, well, well. But it does rather seem like she's just a like for like replacement for Rebecca Ferguson who gets bumped off in one of many fairly emotionless scenes. The whole film is lacking in emotion and as someone else's review said, it's like the film was written by AI. The score is also too overbearing at times, intruding rather than complementing scenes. Cruises face looks more distorted with every film but he still knows how to carry the franchise.Hopefully part two can bring things to a satisfactory conclusion. This is certainly the weakest of the Series so far, just behind MI2 and a world behind the excellent Fallout.All in all, a disappointment but still a decent watch.",
    "33": "The first 60-80 minutes were fantastic, interesting story with non stop action that for the most part looked authentic and low on cgi, then somewhere at that point the pace became slower and the characters kept talking every 2 seconds about THE KEY. What followed was much less realistic action movie with more cgi, green screens and girl power emphasis. I did like Hayley Atwell (very sexy) but the rest of the female cast was weak and felt forced. Tom Cruise himself did a decent job as usual and the main villain was okaysh. The last action sequence on the train felt way over the top, especially the whole bike stunt jumping from the top of the mountain and reaching to a specific part of the train at the exact right time and place. In the words of sleepy Joe - 'come on, man!'\nAnyhow, still a decent movie, worth watching on the big screen mainly for it's first half but don't expect the sharpness and cleverness of some of the previous mission impossible movies that had better stories.",
    "34": "Not only was that a generous rating, i'm still wondering why i thought it might be any better than it was...oh yeah...the last few mission impossible movies...\nanother reviewer gave me some insight into what gutted this movie...the pandemic. Hadn't even occurred to me, since i assumed that it was made thereafter.But i don't know how that might have affected the ridiculous dialogue. Or the absurd situations using the same old tired mission impossible 'tricks'. But maybe that's a 'nod' to the original show...a bit for the old fans. I don't know. I just thought it was tedious. I don't go for just effects and stunts...",
    "35": "This is just a 2 hour fight scene. Some of the action is good but there is SO much of it eventually it all just blends together into a booting mess. Without a story there is just nothing to be invested in. The story is seriously mediocre, and the dialog isn't much better than day time tv drama. It really hurts to listen to. Also there is wayyyy to much exposition. No clever cinematography to show us back story... just long explanationathons vommited at the viewer.It's the sad state of modern cinema. Watch this movie back to back with MI1. Story needs to serve action not the other way around. It's bad.",
    "36": "A lot of us have pretty much grown up while loving this franchisee - one installment at a time. And it has been wonderful to see the franchisee evolve (specially last two movies) with changing times and taste of audience. But latest 'Dead Reckoning Part 1' turned out to be very disappointing due general lack of depth in plot, characters and dialogues.'Sense of Urgency' has been one of pillars of MI but throughout this movie, none was felt. Everyone was just going about sitting and talking in long scenes revealing little and repeating the same points. After initial 30 minutes, I thought may be movie will pick up pace but there was absolutely NO build up or edge of the seat scenes. Multiple times, I found myself waiting for scenes to get over during later part of the film.Villian was kinda inconsistent and non-threatening and come onnnnn ----> 'he loses the key to ethan and he just shouts his name in frustration like this was a scene in home-aloneee' !!Tom's character seemed sympathetic or caring towards new female lead but they never showed any reason why he should be!!! In the climax, Tom spent way too much time on bike while alot of action happened in the train.. eventually he jumps but then again climbs on top of train and villian actually ran towards him to fight!! Seriously ....????!!Action and stunts are top notch with healthy dosage of trademark humour but overall too thin on plot line, characters or relationships!!And I dont know when I will get over the scene where female lead is worried if he will leave her alone on the train and he says \"I will be there!!!!!!???!?!?!\"Alas.... so much wasted potential and money!!!",
    "37": "I thought the first 10 minutes was going to take us into a suspenseful \"What's going on here?\" story. WRONG!!! OH MY GOSH, THERE'S A KEY!!!...but not just any key. This key has (WOW!!) two parts. AND THEY LIGHT UP WHEN THE HALVES COME TOGETHER!!!! WOW!!! COOL!!! Sorry, but this movie was all flash and over-the-top action sequences that were thrown together only because that's what the audience expects from an Impossible Mission. It doesn't surprise that PART II was filmed ar the same time. They could have taken care of the entire KEY story in one movie and made their ridiculous profit, but why settle for a billion dollars with PART ONE when Tom and the crew can make two billion with two movies???",
    "38": "Woeful script, weak story, shoddy pacing and lengthy exposition reveals how badly COVID hit this production. How the franchise can go from the near perfect cinematic heights of 'Fallout' to this, is so disappointing. Hayley Atwell shines, but even Cruise fails to rescue it. Simon Pegg with no funny lines.. how is that possible? I mean, by action movie standards it's ahead of most, but this isn't any action franchise therefore the disappointment hits hard. I think McQ and Cruise need to rewatch Fallout before they finish up on Part 2. One other thing, having read the bulk of reviews, there are some seriously overrated journalists out there, quite a lot of them by the looks of it. Real cinema fans want rate this one above a 6 or 7, I'd understand if it were lower too.",
    "39": "Wow this had problems. Weakest entry since MI2.1. The Entity is a never-ending supply of plot conveniences. Covers up sloppy writing as needed. Total get-out-of-jail-free card.2. Grace had the most irritating character writing I'd seen in years. She's the stereotypical \"thief you can't trust\" character who will conveniently pickpocket someone as the plot demands. Ethan's unexplained attachment to her is obsessive and nonsensical. I wanted her gone as soon as her character was introduced, and not in a good way. TERRIBLE character.3. Waste of Ilsa Faust. Grace just neatly replaced her. Pointless death.4. The final act involving the train was lifted right out of Uncharted 2. Completely unoriginal.5. Pom Klementieff's character was ridiculous and unnecessary in every sense. Existed for \"deus ex machina\" moments and nothing else.6. Consistently overplays the \"this was part of my plan all along\" card trying to make its audience think it's clever.7. Gabriel made no sense at any point. He wasn't threatening or anything. Silly.8. When Ethan reveals he swapped the key for the \"lighter\" in Gabriel's pocket at the end, I audibly groaned. Absolutely ridiculous how lazy that writing was.9. The action scenes were a step down from the previous three movies in every way. The chase scenes weren't as well-done, the fights were over-choreographed and made no sense (e.g., Ilsa literally had a sword but insisted on choking Gabriel TWICE), and the stunts were underwhelming.10. The dialogue feels so artificial. The scene where the various national security officials are explaining the circumstances to Cary Elwes's character was the most clearly scripted thing I'd heard in years.",
    "40": "SPOILERS.. don't read if you haven't watched.I have always been a fan of the Mission Impossible franchise, and I'm open to the idea of killing off a main character. However, if you're going to do it, you need to do it properly.First and foremost, the deaths should leave a lasting impact. They should be meaningful and contribute to the storyline, so the audience can understand why the beloved character had to go.That being said, what they did to Ilsa's character was disappointingly lazy. In a movie that runs for 2 hours and 43 minutes, they couldn't spare a couple of extra minutes to create a powerful scene?I find it hard to believe that the creator of a movie centered around the main character, Ethan, and the love for his friends would think it's a good idea to let one of them die alone on a bridge in such a poorly executed ending.If she is indeed dead, then her demise is the most anticlimactic killing of a main character I've ever seen. She had faced much more formidable villains in the past, only to be killed by a pocket knife in a two-minute flight scene that wasn't even well-executed (unlike the one she had in Rogue Nation). At the very least, they could have let Ethan arrive in time for them to exchange a few words and say their goodbyes.The worst part, in my opinion, is that they don't even utilize her death properly to enhance the storyline. It's like, \"Oh, I'm a bit more angry now,\" with a character I was already angry at before. It should have had a more profound impact on the other characters. Ethan finding her on the floor and reacting with a sense of true devastation, instead of you have Ethan find her on the floor and it's like.. oh no .. that is a shame.. followed by a scene that him and Benji shed a couple tears.This leaves me with the nagging feeling that maybe she isn't actually dead. The choice to kill off a character like that ,offscreen, just doesn't seem to align with what we know about the franchise.Overall, I did enjoy the movie. It was action-packed and a lot of fun to watch. However, I was genuinely disappointed with this particular sequence because it didn't even fit the story that had been developed for Ethan and Ilsa over the past two movies, especially considering the closure in Fallout. It feels like they made this decision on the spot, without proper consideration.I hope the next installment explains more and provides proper closure for the remaining characters, assuming this is indeed the last Mission Impossible movie.",
    "41": "With this being the first of a two-parter (shot back-to-back before, the second part will be released next year), there is speculation as to whether they will be the final two films in the successful franchise, based on the popular 1960s TV series, either way I was highly excited for this seventh entry, directed by Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation & Fallout). Basically, next-generation Russian submarine Sevastopol has an advanced artificial intelligence for testing a new navigation system that uses dead reckoning (calculating the current position of a moving object by using a previously determined position). However, the AI goes rogue and tricks the crew into firing a torpedo at an invisible enemy vessel. This causes the torpedo to turn back onto the submarine itself, sinking it and killing all aboard. IMF (Impossible Missions Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, also producing) is assigned to retrieve half of a cruciform key. It is unclear what the key unlocks, but it is most likely for something potentially catastrophic. The half-key is with rogue MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who has a bounty of $50 million from IMF on her head. Ethan travels to Saudi Arabia where he finds Ilsa hiding in the desert, knowing he is the only person she can trust. After rescuing her from a team of mercenaries he obtains the half-key. He then infiltrates a meeting of leaders of the U. S. Intelligence Community in Washington, D. C., including CIA Director Eugene Kittridge (Henry Czerny) (last seen in the original 1996 Mission Impossible) and Director of National Intelligence Denlinger (Cary Elwes), to discuss the rogue AI, named the Entity. They discuss how the Entity has achieved sentience and infiltrated the major defence, military systems, intelligence, and financial networks of the world. World powers compete to obtain the key to protect their national security and control the Entity, though it is unclear how it can be controlled. Ethan believes the Entity poses too great a threat to humanity and seeks to destroy it. He and his teammates Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the holder of the other half-key. U. S. Agents are searching for Ethan, following his actions in Washington, and going rogue, but he evades them. At the airport, Ethan sees and recognises terrorist Gabriel (Esai Morales), a figure from his part before he became an IMF agent, who is now working alongside the Entity. Hacking the airport surveillance, Luther identifies a suspicious luggage bag; Benji finds what appears to be a nuclear explosive with a word puzzle to be solved by displayed riddles and questions Benji solves the word puzzle and defuses the device, but finds it is empty. Meanwhile, the half-key is stolen by a professional thief named Grace (Hayley Atwell), who Ethan follows on plane to Rome, Italy. Ethan and Grace end up in a chase through the streets, pursued by French assassin Paris (Pom Klementieff), a subordinate for Gabriel. After Grace escapes again, Ethan reunites with Benji, Luther, and Ilsa. With support from Benji and Luther, Ethan and Ilsa infiltrate a party in Venice held by the arms dealer, Alanna Mitsopolis, aka the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), daughter of deceased arms dealer Max (Vanessa Redgrave in the original film) who has the other half of the key. They hope to find out who hired Grace and learn of the key's purpose. Grace encounters Gabriel and learns that Alanna hired her to steal the half-key. Ethan unsuccessfully tries to talk a fearful Alanna out of selling it. Gabriel reveals that the Entity has infiltrated the party and determined that one of Ethan's allies, either Ilsa or Grace, will die. The team scatters as Grace runs through the streets, only to be caught up to by Gabriel by the canal. Ethan tries to find her, but the Entity, posing as the voice of Benji, sends him the wrong direction. Ethan gets into a fight with Paris until he manages to subdue her, but he chooses to spare her life. Gabriel subdues Grace and gets into a fight with Ilsa, ultimately ending with him fatally stabbing her, and Ethan is too late to save her. Grace joins Ethan, Benji, and Luther as she feels remorse for Ilsa's death, but Luther assures her that she is not to blame. They plan to board the Orient Express travelling to Innsbruck, Austria where will meet with her buyer. Benji makes a mask for Grace to pose as Alanna, but when he tries to make a mask for Ethan to pose as her brother Zola (Frederick Schmidt), the mask machine malfunctions. Ethan is forced to come up with a new plan to board the train, while Luther leaves for an off-grid location to break down traces of the Entity in his hard drive. Before leaving, Luther warns Ethan not to kill Gabriel out of vengeance, as only Gabriel knows how to use the key. On the train, Gabriel kills the engine crew and destroys the throttle and brake. Grace finds Alanna and she is knocked unconscious, allowing her to take her place to impersonate her and meet the buyer, revealed to be Kittridge. He meets Denlinger, who proposes he aligns himself with The Entity. Denlinger explains that the complete key unlocks the chamber housing the computer of the Sevastopol, containing the early version of the Entity that can be used to control or destroy it. Meanwhile, Ethan is on a motorbike having missed the chance to board the train, he is being directed by Benji to a way to get onboard. Finally, Ethan reaches the edge of a cliff, high above the valley with the train in view, Benji says he can parachute onto the train. Ethan backs up and drives the motorbike over the edge, leaping as it descends and deploys his parachute when far enough from the rocks. Back on the train, when Denlinger mentions his knowledge of the submarine's location, Gabriel slashes his throat. He then prepares to kill Paris, suspecting she will betray him after Ethan spared her in Venice, so he stabs her. The deal goes ahead with $100 million being transferred; Grace is tempted to betray Ethan for her own protection. But she changes her mind, pickpocketing the key from Kittridge, removing her disguise, and fleeing, just before the real Alanna wakes and walks in. Moments later, Ethan crashes through the carriage window with his parachute and saves Grace from her pursuers. But Gabriel acquires the key from her and climbs to the top of the train. Ethan goes after Gabriel, while Community agents Jasper Briggs (Shea Whigham) and his partner Degas (Greg Tarzan Davis) are also on the train and go after him. Grace heads to the front to try and stop the train from going further. Ethan overpowers Gabriel atop the train, but Jasper and Degas corner him before he can kill Gabriel, allowing him to jump off the train. Gabriel then triggers bombs beneath the upcoming bridge. Briggs and Degas try to get all the passengers to safety, while Ethan and Grace manage to detach the locomotive from the rest of the train. Ethan and Grace are forced to climb through multiple cars falling off the bridge. Just before they fall, they are saved by Paris. Before she succumbs to her wounds, she reveals the key's connection to the Sevastopol. Ethan reveals to Grace that he pickpocketed the completed key back from Gabriel during their fight and before he escaped. Ethan escapes the train with a parachute before Briggs and Degas can arrest him. Grace finds Kittridge and informs him that she wants to join IMF. Ethan reunites with Benji and shows him the key. Ethan later receives a voice message from Kittridge with his next mission, to find the Sevastopol and save the world, and he wishes Ethan good luck. Also starring Mariela Garriga as Marie, Charles Parnell as NRO, Mark Gatiss as NSA, Indira Varma as DIA, Rob Delaney as JSOC, and Marcin Dorocinski as Captain. Cruise is fantastic as the secret agent prepared to go to great lengths, and is brave to do his own stunts, Rhames and Pegg as his teammates are great support, Attwell is really likeable, and Morales and Klementieff are good as villains. It should be noted that this took longer to make and release because of the impact of COVID-19, but many would have seen the images of Cruise and the highly anticipated motorbike leap stunt, this is the most exciting sequence. The plot involving paranoia brought by a self-aware AI weapon that could destroy the world is intriguing, the set pieces are spectacular, the fights, chases, and stunts are fast-paced, tense and genuinely heart-racing, the gadgetry is cool, and the music by Lorne Balfe, including the Lalo Schifrin theme tune, is good. Along with Fallout, this ranks as the most awesome of the series and I cannot wait to see the continuation and (possible) conclusion, a highly satisfying spy action. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!",
    "42": "When I have to watch a film over several sessions before I can get through it, I generally know it isn't working.I've been a fan of MI films and I admire Tom Cruise as an actor but this film doesn't really work.Its central premise is an ultimate Artificial Intelligence entity which controls everything and which Ethan has to fight. To make a plot, the Entity is given a master key, which of course comes in two separated halves. Everyone is out to find these missing parts, in order to control the AI. This is all beyond contrived, so that the rather feeble plot now zig-zags between an Indiana style 'find the Ark / find the Grail' chase vs an altered reality show in which nothing is quite what is seems and we can't be sure anyone, anything, or any action is in fact happening.Yawn.Sorry Tom, this really doesn't work very well.",

The whole movie was not organized and was lacking a lot of connection. I was not seeing a good flow of the story. The whole thing just look like an absolute chaos and it looked out of place & order.

Oddly, I've only ever seen the original \"Mission Impossible\" with Tom Cruise and none of the sequels, before I ever started writing these reviews, so I'm tempted to go back and check them all out in due time. As for this story line, I'm still not convinced the cruciform key at the center of the story has been satisfactorily retrieved.

    "63": "Another entry into the Mission Impossible series definitely hits the mark. With stunning stunts, great action and comedy that hits, it ultimately leads perfectly into the second part. The pacing of the film held well and the final act added some much needed tension.In the first act, Hayley Atwell's character was introduced to the franchise and she absolutely shined next to the amazing Tom Cruise. They both complimented each other greatly on screen and gave a great performance, comedic and sincere.The problems I do personally have with the film was the second act. Some parts of it did linger on and felt quite unnecessary. I found myself feeling some boredom especially after one of the best car chase scenes I have seen. Rebecca Fergusons' character death definitely did have an impact however and there was a lot of weight that Ethan Hunt had to endure past this point. Including having to hold himself back from killing the man he ever so desperately hates. This was a great character death that pushed the story along.These feelings aside however, it is an honourable addition to the series and cannot wait for the second part of Mission Impossible: Dead reckoning.",
    "64": "Really solid Mission Impossible movie. This was a fun time out in the theater. I don't think this is the best of the Missions films.. but was still quite good. There were some really excellent action sequences.. and the acting was really good across the board. I was really into many of the sequences and they were tense and exciting.There were some plot/script things that sort of didn't make a ton of sense unfortunately. I wish things made a bit more sense wtih the plot.. but it's wasn't a huge deal. Also the movie felt a little un-even. Although I think they had to start and stop shooing a bunch of times due to Covid.. so I'll give them a little slack on that. Fun movie.. and I'm looking to Part 2.",
    "65": "Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One: A tale of great adventures, fights in and on trains, car chases, mororbike chases, paragliding and parachuting.

The AI becomes sentient when it is transmitted to a Russian Submarine, subverting the aI on board that and fusing with it to create the new Rogue AI. The quest for the keys which will help to destroy this AI provides the heart of this narrative. Great fun, looking forward to part two. 8/10. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie from a screenplay he co-wrote with Erik Jendresen.",
    "66": "Let's be honest here. Tom Cruise has saved Hollywood. His latest film is MEANT to be watched on the big screen as he says in the introduction. The movie was great! It is clear that Tom Cruise KNOWS how to make a movie that will keep you on the edge of your SEAT! This movie had it all! Lots of great action scenes, the plot was not overly complex as his prior movies have been, the female leads were fantastic! However, there is one person who STOLE THE SHOW. It's the guy who played PACO MORALES from BAD BOYS! Yes, you heard me right. Esai Morales! He played Gabriel! His character was so delightfully evil. There will be a part two to this movie (thank goodness). I just hope it comes soon. I can't wait to see part two. Thank you Tom Cruise! Thank you from ALL OF US!",
    "67": "Great action scenes but felt they were extended for no reason which made the film unnecessarily 45mins too long. They could of cut the film decently and had a richer story develop into one final complete film for a near 3hr run time to end the series but extended it to make it into two parts to follow Hollywood trends and maximize profits. Many of the shots were beautifully done although I'm not a big fan of the cameras they used for the film. The close up face shots during intense tension and whispered dialogue were great in the beginning but was over used throughout the film. I don't know why they used AI enhanced facial shots so much I thought it would've been more relatable to see Tom aged and everyone's imperfections made it a bit weird for me. Overall a good flick at unnecessary costs.",
    "68": "I may be late for this review, but let's delve into it. Tom Cruise, who has been elevating the quality of action films he stars in during recent years, manages to push the genre to the top from a technical perspective in his latest action flick, MI7, despite some script shortcomings.Regarding camera work, it is the best I have seen since John Wick 4. The fight scenes, especially one sequence I can call \"Bridge Fight\" featuring Ilsa vs. Gabriel, are exceptional. I find myself eager to rewatch that scene multiple times. Simultaneously, Ethan fighting two people in a tight spot exemplifies how well fight choreography can be executed when needed.In terms of acting, I didn't witness extraordinary performances, but Tom Cruise continues to improve. He doesn't come across as forced in emotional scenes and adds quality to the film with the scenes he genuinely experiences without using stunt doubles. We can't thank him enough; he is tirelessly keeping this genre and the industry alive.As for the script, I believe there are occasional clichéd and simplistic solutions when Ethan finds himself cornered and desperate. Considering the film's current and high-quality premise, these aspects stand out glaringly.However, the film compensates for these few shortcomings by providing real entertainment and a smooth flow. After watching the movie, you remember it not for its flaws but for its outstanding action sequences.I think it is a bit more chaotic than Fallout, but they still managed to maintain the quality. The series continues to improve itself in leaps and bounds.The chemistry between the actors was at an optimal level, and I personally enjoyed it. I had a lot of fun, particularly with the cinematography and camera work.In short, I don't know if it's the best it can be in a visionary sense, but it is undeniably a commendable effort to keep the series going. The film's production coincided with the pandemic, making it a real challenge, but the director and the entire team managed to put in a lot of effort and deliver a distinctive film despite some script deficiencies and shortcuts (For example, that famous scene where Ethan jumps from the mountain and finds Grace's troubled wagon in the 10-carriage train and enters through the window). Lastly, I don't know if it's just a coincidence, but the topic of artificial intelligence came at an interesting time. Uncontrollable artificial intelligence will undoubtedly both greatly facilitate our lives and pose the biggest threat waiting for us in the future...",
    "69": "This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.",
    "70": "This could turn out to be the most entertaining blockbuster of 2023. It's certainly going to be hard to beat. Top-notch action, thrills galore and quips aplenty as the characters interact combine to great enjoyment.Of course Tom Cruise is the star of the show. But Hayley Atwell provides a meaningful counterpoint to his potentially over-dominant star quality. She is able to give us a character who very much inhabits her own space and the film benefits a great deal from that.Of course it is still just an entertainment, which is why I cannot award a ten. But the comedy and action allowed me to rise above any holes in the plot and simply enjoy the entertainment on offer. Object achieved, Mr Cruise!",
    "71": "This is a fun action movie and another worthy entry in a consistently excellent series.The cast is game, with Cruise as protagonist Ethan Hunt, Pegg and Rhames as his tech buddies. The gorgeous, soulful Rebecca Ferguson is present but sadly underused - and yes, I do have a crush for her: blame the opera scene in Rogue Nation and that yellow dress. Newcomers include Atwell, Klementieff and Morales; Czerny returns to the series after nearly 30 years (he was the guy who got a fish tank blown up in his face in the first film) as smug-but-not-completely-evil bureaucrat Kittridge.The set-pieces are fun and spectacular as usual, especially an inventive train crash in the climax.Villains are somewhat lacking. The Big Bad is a personality-less, nearly omnipotent AI who is only occasionally scary and memorable; I liked a creepy scene in Venice where it affects the communications between Ethan and friends and starts imitating Benji's voice misleading Ethan: the movie needed more of that. Then we have mysterious baddie Gabriel, whose previous connection to Ethan is implied but never properly explained and made interesting / not cliched. The best is by far Pom Klementieff as a feral assassin with a unique personal style.Although, to its credit, Dead Reckoning never really drags, there are too many scenes with characters earnestly trading somber chunks of exposition - this would have been better with the breezier pacing of, say, Ghost Protocol.Still, another perfectly competent entry. To quote the name of one of Hans Zimmer's best tracks in MI2: mission accomplished.7,5/10.",
    "72": "While this movie maintains the stunning action sequences and stunt work, the rest of the movie is severely lacking. Despite the development of the characters from previous movies, they feel very thin and hollow in MI 7. The pacing of the film and writing are quite peculiar. It almost feels hacked together in a messy way. The previous movie managed to create compelling characters, with moments that clearly defined them and made them standout from one another. In this iteration, they feel like rote action movie characters without distinguishing characteristics. The previous movie also managed a sense of whimsy through the writing and cinematography that was completely absent from MI 7. This general tone and pacing was perhaps my favorite aspect of MI 6, so for it to be missing this time around felt like a huge step backwards for me.Overall, the movie just felt a bit bizarre. Almost like an AI wrote it or something. I seriously hope the next one tries to get closer to the tone of MI 6.",
    "73": "As a huge Mission Impossible fan (yes I prefer this series more than 007), I am giving this a fairly low score because I personally feel that the plot is cheap and too common like most protagonist-antagonist action film these days; where the bad guy turns into an ally. The movie did not fail to cope up with latest technologies, but as part of the plot, it is yet again cheap with a plot of having to simply retrieve something from the antagonist in order to save the world.I also dislike how they portray that Ethan's biggest weakness is women in this movie. I know for a fact that Ethan Hunt cherishes friendship deeply, but this movie entirely focused on female relationships (insufficient appreciation to benji and luther)In addition, the fighting scenes also gets unoriginal as I somehow sense mimickery to the John Wick fighting styles where they incorporate knives, swords, and batons as a weapon, in contrary to previous MI series that mostly use combat and gun. Relatively, the combat scenes are basic and not even that good, a lot of times unecessary going back and forth.However, Benji and Luther made this movie so much better though, and I wish they had more scenes. The only exciting scene for me was when Ethan actually arrived on the train. This part had me on the edge of my seat. But when he was trying to get on the train, Jesus, the whole things was made too slow and problematic. In fact, all of the chase scenes took too long and this got me and my family irritated. As a huge fan, I really hope they work on Part 2.",

Just stupid!And while I am talking about the steam train, Hawk manages to skydive into said moving train at the EXACT right window to take out the bad guys. LMAO.I know that \"spy\" and \"action\" movies have always had a little bit of fantasy when it comes to the good guys versus the bad guys (James Bond franchise springs to mind) BUT they were always imbued with a sense of realism.

It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.",

The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.",
    "77": "Except for the very first movie in this franchise with Tom Cruise which was released in 1996 and which was an excellent movie in every way,the script always takes a back seat in this franchise,which was the case in this film. The focus is more on high quality action,disguises,daredevilry,\nhigh paced chases and extremely beautiful and scenic locations. In this regard,the movie did not disappoint and definitely checked all those boxes.The acting as always was at best average and the editing was off by about 10 minutes or so.Nevertheless it was a good watch and one of the better ones in this 27 year old franchise\n7/10.",
    "78": "This movie is like some stupid video game. Nothing makes sense. It's like watching a cartoon. None of the characters are worthy investing your emotion in. There is no one to root for & neither is there anyone to invoke the feelings a good villain is supposed to. So in the end you really don't care what happens to all of them. Infact you start to get a feeling that maybe they are all better off dead so the movie can be over & you can go on with your life. The action is ridiculously fictitious & prolonged. Yes this is a MI movie, but it is not cartoon. The other thing, what's with the zooming into the actors faces, like there is some important facial details that are supposed to contribute to the essence of the movie. Just too stupid a movie to waste your 3 hours on & the worst part to it all, there will be a sequel.",
    "79": "Tom Cruise's new adventure in this seventh installment of the saga begins a mission that goes beyond the above, seen introducing artificial intelligence as the greatest threat that has ever been faced. The film does not lose the tone of its predecessors and the action starts at a basic level and then builds up. In that aspect it is somewhat reminiscent of the first film in the saga. The script is clever enough to make this chapter a good preparation for what will come next. Tom Cruise and his companions Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames do not disappoint in the slightest. With action scenes that excite and generate tension, this seventh Mission Impossible movie is a promising start to the farewell to this saga starring Tom Cruise. My final rating for this movie is 9/10.",
    "80": "First of all: the introduction was very good in my opinion (30 min👀). The plot is meh, it s just a two piece key which is being followed the whole movie. The IMF team has just the scene at the airport in the beginning basically. There are no tricks and twists as in the last movies of the series. A Mission Impossible film of nearly 3 hours cannot contain like 5 (maybe?) Action scenes. Plus what the hell did they do with Ilsa? They just ended the storyline which was built very well in the last movies. Literally nonsense. The bike stunt has been literally spoiled everywhere as the movie sequence is exactly like the trailers. Really hope for part two to deliver a proper ending to this franchise (hope they will not do as Game of Thrones)",
    "81": "Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.",
    "82": "Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.",
    "83": "After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.",
    "84": "4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly \"bad\" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me. THAT has never happened to me before watching a MI movie!Despite this disappointing conclusion I still wanna thank you for reading my 2001 th review on Imdb.",
    "85": "Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",
    "86": "This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!",
    "87": "To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",
    "88": "Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect. Baffling.",
    "89": "Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",
    "90": "I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think \"Surely now this has peaked\" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on. Nobody else is remotely close to their level. I would gladly watch this again immediately. Booking the tickets right now.",
    "91": "All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless. If it wasn't for a couple of action scenes I would not remember a single thing about this movie in a couple of days.",
    "92": "Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.",
    "93": "I'll admit that some of the Mission: Impossible movies blur together (though I like them all, to varying degrees), so I have to cautiously say that Dead Reckoning Part One might be the best so far. I've only seen the others once each, and didn't rewatch any in preparation for this one, but I don't remember any of the others being quite this entertaining or amazingly well-paced.After the slog that was Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Dead Reckoning was a huge relief - a big-budget sequel in a long-running series that actually lived up to the anticipation. This film has an amazing final act- the whole last hour is just perfect, as far as action movies go, being similarly thrilling to the go-for-broke final act in the most recent John Wick.Tom Cruise is great in the action scenes of course, but he's also doing great work here in dramatic and comedic capacities, too. The rest of the cast are also all really good, and even if the most exciting part of the movie is the whole extended final sequence, the action before then is still fantastic (and includes one of the best car chases of the past few years, too).It's over-the-top action that also feels believable and authentic, and I think they just got the balance perfectly right here between hilariously ridiculous and genuinely intense/suspenseful. There's a lot of set-up near the start that felt a bit wordy - lots of silly technical jargon - but I guess they had to establish a central conflict to play out over two movies, so the extended opening was probably needed. But once it really gets going, Dead Reckoning Part One delivers some of the best blockbuster action since Max Max: Fury Road (yeah, it's almost that good).",
    "94": "A Part One that still felt like a complete movie, this is how you make a great movie in a franchise that's already going for almost 30 years and they still nailed it and keeps getting better or still as great, when you handing it on the right person like Tom Cruise who are giving his 100%, and makes a really careful good decision then it will work, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was another achievement in action movies as a whole, this is the most serious MI movie experience i've ever experienced and one of the most serious movie experience i've ever experienced as i really locked in and really engaged to the story, following every single dialogue that are really well written, and man do we have to talk about the performance, Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, and Simon Pegg was like a family already and i'm pretty sure they did not need any rehearsal as they chemistry was already there since the fifth one, Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby returning performance was also great, Pom Klementieff gave a very interesting performance as a character and she was amazing in terms of action sequences, Esai Morales was a good intense villain, and last but not least Hayley Atwell at possibly her best performance she's ever in and i think she might be my favorite Ethan Hunt sort of sidekick besides his own team, she was incredible and her present was lovely every single second of it, action scene in MI movie was always in another different level, top notch craziness and just all full praises for the action sequence, they did borrowed some things but i didn't take it as a problem, one of the last sequence in the movie involving only Tom Cruise and Hayley Atwell was one of the most intense sequence i've ever seen and it was just perfect, now it's important for me to also say that the movie wasn't completely perfect as there is some couple of little poor editing in the first 15 minutes and couple of nit picky here and there but not up to the point where it's losing a big 1 score from 10 to 9, so overall Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was another solid installment from a solid franchise, a 2 hours and 43 minutes movie that goes fly just like that because the movie was fills with great story, great performance, great action, great score, great writing, and great everything, i have a blast with Dead Reckoning Part One, and thank you Tom Cruise for making a movie that obviously made from the heart because this movie is amazing and just incredibly well made, well done Sir!",
    "95": "No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",
    "96": "No pun intended - life is still stranger than fiction - especially now when we have studios trying to get likenesses of people - pay them once and use them til the end of time. Of course the movie here is way more sinister .. although you may find the reality and greed of producers way out of line and more evil.That all being said, the MI franchise has been going for a while. I don't think even Tom could have dreamt where he would take the whole franchise when he began in the 90s. It might make sense to rewatch some of the previous movies - friend of mine and myself weren't sure if a character already had been introduced before (Gabriel) because of some flashbacks we get to see during the movie. Seems like he is as new as Hayley ... while still having a \"history\". Or has he? Can we tell what is real? I reckon that one is supposed to be lore to it all.Talking of lore and history: I also can't tell you if this picks up or references anything from the tv show. I can tell you that there are enough new people in this, that it works as sort of standalone too. Although it is nice if you at least know the characters (Ving Rhames being here from the beginning like Tom/Ethan) ... though as you can tell and this being the beginning of the end (if Tom doesn't decide he'll do more than a second part to this) .. no one is safe. Or are they? Well you have to watch the movie to know.It has many things that do not make much sense, but are there to boast suspense ... just don't overthink motives and stuff like that. Or how illogical some people are and act. Plot holes - do they really matter to you? And while Gabriel is played by a great actor, I reckon no one can overshadow P. S. Hoffman ... from part 4. That said, I reckon I decided that the action and the stunts (again logic aside, even though you can't run from it .. right Tom/Ethan?) ... well they are worthy of being called entertainment at its finest ... well or at par with the MI4 ... and while it seems to be the year of the open endings (so many movies leave us ... hanging, sorry but had to), this one is done very well ... and I reckon this time next year I might do a bit of a rewatch ... especially the first 3 or 4 movies ... now go on ... Hunt!",
    "97": "Ethan Hunt and his IM team are tasked with recovering both parts of a key which may be able to control a sentient and now rogue AI, known as 'The Entity', which can infiltrate all systems including weapons systems and could potentially take over the World. Whilst countries are interested in getting control of The Entity for their own ends, Hunt is determined to destroy it.Whilst, with the exception of MI 2, I have always enjoyed these films, I found this one a bit hard to take. It's not that it isn't exciting, with the usual death defying action / stunt scenes and indeed the 163 minute running time mostly shot by, it's just that whilst AI is a reasonable target in this day and age, so much of it was a stretch on the imagination - basically I found a lot of it a bit silly. In particular, discussions about the end of the World drag on a bit and a very long and rather boring section at a big party held by Vanessa Kirby, which suggested the Entity was watching them all like some sort of ethereal spirit gone bad was just too much. Rebecca Ferguson is wasted, Simon Pegg seems more wired than usual and Esai Morales is unconvincing as a 60 year old tough guy who seems to be able to beat everyone up. Cruise is fine and Hayley Atwell is the best thing in this and overall there is a lot of fun to be had here leading up to a spectacular and exciting climax. I do look forward to part 2, but the ideas here are a mission to far for me - Rogue Nation and Fallout were much better films.",
    "98": "Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning is a very different movie than the past 4 entires. For one, it doesn't have a well defined awesome villain. 2- the film leans hard into Dutch angles and Closeups of actors. There's hardly moments where you can take in the scenery or get yourself used to the geography of the locations. This was never the case in previous entries. 3- What are the motivations of the characters to do the dangerous things they are getting themselves into? It's on thin ice motivations-wise. 4- There's a lot of Tell, not a lot of show going on. Things are being described to us as opposed to being shown in a clever way. 5- Other than the climactic train stunts, there are no memorable action sequences as compared to previous entries. 6. The film is too long. The content in this movie could have been 2 hrs. It is a really bloated movie. 7. The hand to hand combat is not that great in the film when compared to other great action scenes that have n presented in other films this year.The good stuff:\n1. Ethan Hunt character is great overall.2. Some of the effects work is really great.Cut the movie down to 2 hours and I would think it's a 6 or 7.",
    "99": "I couldn't be more excited to go see it. My family and I are big fans of Tom Cruise's action films and mainly MI 4, 5 (and 6). I was so certain I'm going to watch this, that I had avoided any trailers and spoilers. The movie was a complete disappointment, I can't believe I'm writing this, and I'm saddened, because I'm afraid the franchise has run its course.Throughout the whole duration, beginning with that cheap opening scene (btw why were they speaking in English?!), I was unconsciously trying to convince myself, that the \"good part\" is coming up, but it never did. The end credits started rolling almost 3 hours in and not a single scene had stood out in my mind. Everything was bland, forced and unoriginal. There was no story, rather a compilation of scenes [******Spoiler Alert: Key lost, key found, saved Grace, Grace stole key and escaped, repeat******]. It also felt like there were never any stakes, no one was ever in peril, and no one including me was having any fun. Additionally:-Where was the great team element & dynamic we've seen in previous installments? Past characters were present here, yet never really utilized. Am I wrong, Ilsa? Was that a decent story arc for Ilsa, an awesome female character equivalent to Hunt we met in MI 5?-What did Ethan Hunt bring to this mission? Anything? He could have been replaced by a generic agent.-Why was Hunt so obsessed with Grace the whole time? 'cause she can pick-pocket greatly?! Her involvement felt out of place.-Where was the actual \"impossible\" mission, where the stakes feel real and intelligence, teamwork and innovation is required?-Was there anything you haven't seen before? Sure, it's pretty hard to create original content in a 7th MI, yet again, honor the previous installments and put in the work.-Shockingly, all action scenes were lifeless and of low quality. Topping previous MI stunts must be almost \"impossible\" and sadly, they definitely made that clear here. Also, such a pity, that bad CGI and filming made it look as if Cruise didn't do his biggest stunts.-MI films are also known for their wittiness and funny interactions during high stakes. Were there any jokes here that didn't feel forced?Tragically, the awesome Top Gun 2 feels more like the sequel to MI 6 than this. MI 7 was lifeless, ultimately joyless and forced. It's such a bummer. I could also feel that the movie was filmed during the pandemic, many scenes where characters were discussing with each other didn't look good, because we were only seeing close-ups of each character. Did it really had to be filmed during the pandemic? Can Part 2 capture the previous awesome MI spirit? Too late for diferent director and screenwriters.",
    "100": "The latest Mission: Impossible film is a part one of two story but finishes in a satisfying way rather than annoying and you won't feel hard done by.It's another great big screen action film that we've come to expect. It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\nMi3\nMi4 Ghost Protocol\nMission: Impossible\nMi4 Rogue Nation\nMi7 Dead Reckoning part one.",
    "101": "The 'Mission: Impossible' series got so lucky picking Tom Cruise way back in 1996. Not only has he stayed in incredible shape ever since, he's been able to do his own stunts for the movies, adding a sense of realism that films like this otherwise simply can't get. It all makes for an incredible product time and time again. And somehow this series keeps getting better with each installment.The film is long at just under 3 hours, but it doesn't feel that way. It's so jam-packed with action sequences that the time flies by. Just how little down-time there is in this movie is quite incredible. The movie often finds ways of getting information across during action sequences so it doesn't have to do it in-between them, or at least not for as long.Also the story was great. It's a very complex plot device they've chosen to use, however they found a way to keep it extremely simple and easy for the audience to follow with the two keys concept. The film was very cleverly written in that way.This is just everything you'd hope for in an action film. An interesting plot, tonnes of terrific characters filling every scene, great action sequences and set in some beautiful and fascinating locations around the world. This was a really good experience. 9/10.",
    "102": "'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)' continues its series' trend of pulling off the impossible by maintaining its quality even as the number of its entries approaches double digits. Despite some early rumblings that this Mission was perhaps not up to the task, I'm happy to report that it's a genuinely enthralling and remarkably entertaining effort from start to finish. While I don't think it's as good as the previous entry (and I certainly wouldn't be able to say it is after having only seen it once), it's right up there with the best of the bunch principally because it's a total blast. Even though the stakes are higher than ever before and it feels as though nothing is off the table, this is a tonally lighter film than 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018)' - as evidenced by Lorne Balfe's bouncier rendition of its theme - and features a number of fairly extended comedic moments to break up the legitimate tension of its more serious segments. Christopher McQuarrie has made each of his efforts feel distinct from one another atmospherically and visually, with this one often having a Brian De Palma vibe (especially in the canted-angle-heavy opening sequence). His penchant for capturing action remains as astonishing as ever, as does his star's willingness to put it all on the line for his audience. Tom Cruise once again blows your socks off with some real-life stunt work that would surely have even the most seasoned stunt person shaking in their boots, but it isn't the movie's most-marketed aspect that necessarily impresses the most here. That's because the other car chases, fist fights and struggles for survival are equally as exciting, if not more so. On top of that, there are several instances of Cruise's classic full-body run to keep that smile that's already on your face there for even longer. There are some truly phenomenal action set-pieces here; even though that's sort of to be expected at this point, it's worth celebrating nevertheless. This is a pulse-pounding, edge-of-your-seat adventure that also makes sure to captivate with its non-action stuff. There are a couple of more traditional story-based set-pieces that centre in on the espionage angle of the narrative, segments which feature suave sleight of hand and despicable double crosses. These are notable because they're just as energetic and enjoyable as a lot of the more bombastic stuff. The narrative itself is perhaps a little loose in places, but it's easy to follow and arguably makes more step-by-step sense than those of the last couple of films. It has veered fully into sci-fi territory, focusing on a sentient rogue AI and the IMF's efforts to destroy it, but the series has always been a little silly and the concept is treated with just enough sincerity that it can be taken seriously (or, at least, as seriously as the filmmakers want you to). The biggest issue with the picture is actually its depiction of its female characters, specifically in how it basically just uses them to motivate its protagonist rather than giving them compelling arcs of their own. I can't really say too much without delving into spoiler territory, but it's a noticeable and disappointing aspect that does dampen some of the flick's narrative success. Still, I can't deny that this is supremely entertaining stuff on the whole. It's an absolute blast that proves the series has yet to run out of steam and is showing no signs of slowing down just yet.",
    "103": "What did 3 years result? A mediocre story that wasnt well thought, a non threatening antagonist and stunts/scenes that have been done countless times by previous directors (youll see it). Nothing was impressive. Spending millions to market a jump scene that was overly exaggerated to be something that has never been done was lackluster, just like the entire film.The story written by director Christopher McQuarrie fell short from plot holes and poor character development (antagonist). Never once will you feel theyre in over their heads or this might be it for them.I love the MI franchise and production quality has always been top notch.DP did a great job.Actors did what they could given the script written (wga on strike? Lol). Hayley Atwell didnt fit the role imho. Her performance was nothing short of boredom.Overall this film was a let down. Fallout was way better. Wait for it on stream, it wont take long. All these previous 9-10 star reviews must have been studio simps watching the premier...dont trust it!",
    "104": "As a fan of this franchise and only disliking one of its films (Mission Impossible 2), I was really looking forward to watching this.I enjoyed the opening submarine scene. But once that was over and the plot was unraveled I felt like I was watching \"Eagle Eye (2008)\". The only difference is that in this film there are multiple agencies aware of the AI/Entity's existence and are looking to control it.There was only one memorable stunt in this film and it was revealed in the trailer. There is a car chase that feels like it dragged on for way too long especially when there wasn't anything special about it.In the other films in this franchise we were made to care about the characters but this felt very emotionless. There were new characters that show up in this film without much explanation for them. The character of Gabriel has to be one of the weakest villains in this franchise. The actor Esai Morales felt very robotic in all of his scenes. I was not convinced of his role throughout the whole film.The character of Grace was unnecessary and unlikeable. All she did was take away screen time from characters like Luther and Benji. The character of Paris was another weak and unnecessary character along with the guys that were following Tom Cruise the whole film.This entire film could have been much shorter especially since it serves as a part one of a film. I don't even know why this film was so long when there are films in this franchise that are much shorter with way more context and excitement. This just didn't feel like a \"Mission Impossible\" movie. The mission didn't seem as epic as in the previous films. There hoesntly seemed to be a lack of gadgets used besides the same old mask trick they use every film. There was only the use of some smoke bomb and a special pair of glasses but besides that there wasn't anything cool.I hated the fight on top of the train especially since it was already done in \"Mission Impossible\". Also it's just not realistic for these people to be fighting and hanging on to a speeding train. They could have did something better and much more original than that.Overall this film was not what I expected and was disappointing. The film ended without much to look forward to. It was too long and not as thrilling as others have been in the past.",
    "105": "The pros:\n1. The first scene is very reminiscent of a Tom Clancy techno-spy thriller which nicely sets up the tone of the movie.2. Good concept for the story. This movie was made about three years ago and was slightly ahead of the AI trend. One talky scene in particular really hammered home the idea that some... maybe all of these characters are only puppets acting out roles in service of the AI. Who's in charge? Us or the AI?2. Pom Klementieff. I just learned today that she is a fellow Canadian. I only knew her as Mantis in the Guardian movies so her role here as an a**kicking henchman was a pleasant surprise.3. Hayley Atwell. Easy on the eyes.4. Esai Morales as the villain isn't so much evil as completely devoid of humanity. He's not so much scary as unnerving. I briefly wondered if he wasn't actually some sort of machine.5. Tom Cruise can still kick in the afterburners when it comes to running.The cons:\nUnfortunately the action scenes are a mixed bag.1. Sometimes, less is more. There is an extended car chase in Rome that goes on too long. We've seen many, many car chase sequences over the decades. This one doesn't really add anything new to the mix. MI has always been about the over-the-top action sequences, but for some reason, they made a ho-hum car chase sequence the centre piece of the movie.Coincidentally, there was also an overlong Rome car chase in the latest Fast and Furious movie. How funny would it have been to catch a glimpse of THAT one happening in the background of THIS one?2. The motorcycle jump was anticlimatic. Thanks to Youtube, most of us have already seen it over and over again during the past year. There's even a 'making of' video which goes into great detail about how the jump was conceived and executed. It included lots of scenes of Cruise doing the stunt over and over. They had to build a runway and a ramp for Cruise to get the necessary speed required for the jump. In the movie some obvious CGI is used to remove the ramp and replace it with mountain terrain.3. The fight scenes are a mixed bag. Ferguson and Morales put on a good show on a bridge. Meanwhile Cruise is reduced to fighting in an narrow and poorly lit alley. It doesn't leave him with many options when it comes to hand-to-hand combat.Overall I enjoyed it, but found it wanting compared to the past couple of entries in the series.",
    "106": "I adore the Mission Impossible franchise, not just because it consists of some of the greatest action thrillers formulated in the past two decades but also because this was one of those franchises I was first exposed to as a novice spectator, one of those early doorways that got me introduced to the scene of Hollywood blockbusters and made me subsequently fall in love with the genre and craft of cinema in general.You can guess how excited I was to see the seventh part, especially after taking into consideration how amazing the two previous parts have been (Rogue Nation and Fallout). Little did I know that I would be settling in for a disappointment! I am not suggesting this was poor; it still had its charm, but it lacked the sophistication and, most importantly, the 'finesse' I so wholeheartedly wished for.The screenplay had sloppy intervals, where specific sequences were needlessly elongated. The action was satisfactory, and the scenes looked impressive on-screen, but their editing did not have the kind of sharpness I desired to see. The composition of the background score, too, sounded a bit generic, and its orchestral heavy tonality took away the sensation of ' Adrenaline rush' and 'excitement' from a couple of high-octane moments as well.The only positive for me to take away from the film was the band that got together once again and the notion of this 'Entity' that, amidst the present-day scenario, looked too pertinent to be unafraid of!I just hope the second part of this story will be told in a much better way and most of the issues that I have encountered here will be taken care of.",
    "107": "The latest Mission Impossible film, dead reckoning, doubles up on the death defying stunts seen in the previous movies to deliver an exhilarating adventure. I think despite what I am about to criticise, on balance, the longevity of the Mission Impossible series is astounding. Most movie series run out of steam after the third movie, but Mission Impossible, like it's immortal star Tom Cruise, manages to keep reinventing and surpassing itself in terms of stunts. These include the much publicised riding a bike off a cliff, but really the movie is filled with exciting set pieces like an early airport foot chase, a comedic Rome Car chase, and a nerve wracking train sequence aboard the orient express. The newcomer to the series, Hayley Atwell, is also suitably effervescent, sharing palpable chemistry with Cruise. The returning cast members are also all uniformly excellent, though I am not entirely thrilled about my favourite cast member being killed off. I think this is merely a symptom of this films deficiencies- that it makes the fatal error of focusing too much on the macguffin- the plot device which details are entirely unimportant to the audience. The writing in this respect really is quite lacklustre- we spend too much time in meeting briefing scenes where there are exposition dumps constantly stressing the severe worldwide ramifications of losing a certain key. I feel these scenes take up way too much time, giving off the impression that the plot thinks it is cleverer than it really is. Because what the plot really is is a load of trite, inaccurate technical jargon rather than the old fashioned espionage story I want. Which is why for my money, Rogue Nation remains my favourite MI film. Rogue Nation does actually have a clever plot full of intricate double crosses, and at the same time it prioritises thrills over spectacle and suspense over action. Also, while Hayley Atwell is great, I still prefer Rebecca Ferguson. Lastly, I feel this movie sometimes gets weighed down by a heightened sense of emotional stakes for Hunt, which I am not particularly fond off, though that is merely a personal preference, and there are many laughs in the film. At the end of the day, Dead Reckoning is still a pretty good film. The run time may be long, but it certainly feels nothing like three hours. But I find that while it doubles down on stunts, it lacks the pace and fun of Fallout, or the solid spy thriller aspect seen in Rogue nation- very much an instance of stunts saving a clunking written plot.",
    "108": "I recently watched a couple of movies where I didn't know it's the first of a two-part movie (Across the Spider-Verse and Fast X). I left both unsatisfied like I didn't watch a full movie. The title \"Dead Reckoning Part One\" avoids misleading the viewers and prevents questioning why certain threads are dangling.Even more impressive, DR1 needed this clarification the least of the three examples. It feels like a full movie with a smooth structure, a climax and a conclusion. I didn't feel a tiny bit unsatisfied from it being part of a bigger whole.As for the movie itself, it's awesome. Great action that feels real, as usual. The story is large and complex with so many moving parts, but they balance it all out so well. So much suspense and tension. It's all up to the usual Mission: Impossible standards.I only have one negative. And it's not even a negative, more like a lack of upside: the action doesn't stand out, there isn't a scene that really wowed me. Ghost Protocol has the Burj Khalifa scene and subsequent sandstorm chase. Fallout has one of the greatest vehicle chases ever filmed, amongst others. I didn't feel those highs, those goosebump moments in this one.To reiterate, the action is awesome and this is a great movie that I will rewatch. Another great chapter to add to this franchise. And I can't wait for Part Two. (1 viewing, opening Tuesday IMAX 7/11/2023)",
    "109": "Any concerns fans had of the Mission: Impossible cinematic universe running out of steam 7 films in will be quickly laid to bed when the lights in the cinema dim and the action to this two-part entry takes hold.Ageing like a fine wine and going against the odds stacked against it, the highs of 2018's entry Fallout have here been topped with writer/director Christopher McQuarrie and his leading man Tom Cruise combining once more to deliver all you could ever want from an action/thriller of this ilk with Covid-19, re-shoot's and gravity unable to hold Dead Reckoning Part One back from becoming one of the must-see blockbusters of the 2023 Summer catalogue.Since its humble beginnings in 1996 when Brian De Palma took a mid-tier TV show to the mainstream, the Mission: Impossible franchise has continued to up its game and spectacle with each passing instalment and while there's nothing here of great substance or anything that should be taken to heart, there's an undeniable charm, quality and enthusiasm on display here that puts many other counterparts to shame with what this film offers for viewers on an almost non-stop two and half hour plus ride.Featuring the return of everyone's favourite impossible mission completionist Ethan Hunt and his merry gang of helpers that includes Ving Rhames Luther, Simon Pegg's Benji, Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa and also new series additions such as Shew Whigham's always one step behind government agent Jasper Briggs and Pom Klementieff's deranged Paris, Dead Reckoning throws a lot of ideas and sequences at us that mostly all land and combine to create a breathtaking thrill ride across the globe.From an early dalliance in the unforgiving sand swept desert, a thrilling game of cat and mouse in a crowded airport, the years best car chase in the streets of Rome right through to a showdown on the famed Orient Express (featuring the films much hyped bike jump Cruise completed for multiple takes), Dead Reckoning has a large collection of stand out segments that all play out like their own mini-movie with their own narratives taking place and when combined with McQuarrie's pinpoint direction, the films smooth and clean editing and Lorne Balfe's perfectly bombastic score, this is the very definition of an all-round package that can't be denied.Coming to us at a time and place where many questions are still being asked about the future of cinema and the blockbuster movie making business in general, with a series of 2023 flops tarnishing an industry looking to bounce back from a tough few years, on the back of Top Gun: Maverick and now this film, Tom Cruise can be seen as a Hollywood player that gets what the people want and whether viewers loathe, love or care no way or the other for the seemingly ageless star, there's no denying that if you want spectacle and entertainment that deserves the big screen treatment, Cruise has you well and truly covered.Final Say -An endlessly enjoyable and thrilling new entry into a series that is getting better with each passing instalment, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is top-shelf Hollywood entertainment that leaves most of its peers in the dust as its leading man and director leave us eagerly awaiting next years Part Two.4 1/2 steering wheels out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",
    "110": "While the Action in Dead Reckoning is crazier than ever, the story is only told through blank long dialogue. The Villain feels incredibly unreal and unnatural, his character did not do enough for me. There were barely any motives beside the stereotypical I want to rule the world.The AI part falls flat, it's an complicated assumption to say that the AI is scared. Because if it is artificial, how could it develop feelings? And if it has some, why can you control the world with it? Does it not act through it's own sense when it feels things? And why even assume to know when an AI is scared or not. That point sticked with me, and the film unfortunately doesn't craft an technical explanation for the AI.Tom Cruise stunts single-handedly safe the movie for me. Without it, I wouldn't have liked it, but he believes in true action and I love that. I waited the whole movie for his hill motorcycle ride, and while his stunt does not disappoint, the editing does. Cutting between his once in a lifetime stunt and a dull dialogue scene in the train does not work for me and takes you out of the tension.I understand that this wants just be an cool action-flick, but Rogue Nation and Fallout also were just cool action-flicks, but they were consistent and hold the tension during their whole runtime.",
    "111": "I don't want to be too extreme and artificially plummet the rating to sub-6 when I did enjoy the movie while watching. However, the title of this review speaks for itself. Out of the 'new' Mission impossible movies, out of the all of the MI movies (of which the ones since Ghost Protocol are a subset, but I hope my emphasis is understood), this is by far the worst Mission Impossible movie. It is by far the worst to the point where I honestly don't understand how the critic reviews are so high...\nSome of the camera work involving duplicitous conversations and backstabbing are wicked, especially with the Dutch angles, but most of the action scenes I found to be underwhelming, and the emotional heft of this movie is sub-zero. Negative. It's like an awful version of Goldeneye from somebody who only heard the synopsis of Goldeneye but didn't watch it. The biggest example of this is Pom's character who is an awful ripoff of Xenia from Goldeneye. Even coming from somebody who wants to be anti-intellectual regarding movie plots that are fun, the plot of this was beyond stupid. And worse is that the stupidity of the plot wasn't made up for by strong emotional performances, but by truly lackluster ones.I don't know what to say other than I was disappointed. The action scenes are underwhelming, and the movie doesn't showcase some of the cool hallmarks of the MI series.",
    "112": "I remember being wowed more with 2018's Fallout but this' still a fun movie, I'd still recommend. An Ethan hunt version of a story that's been told before, especially if you watch sci-fi. A pretty well figured out plot but felt familiar since it's not the first \"AI goes sentient\" story there is. I'd say it does a better job than a good chunk of ai-premise movies have done, but it still has already been done before.I do think it's too long. I started to zombie through it, I wasn't bored just not particularly interested anymore. It felt like the story was being dragged out, twists and turns to delay the end and make it more complex because it's not a groundbreaking 'AI goes rogue' premise as I said. Nearly 3hrs so that's a long time to be thrown left and right if you're considering watching in 4dx.It's still your usual cast from previous movies, I thought the protagonists were pretty convincing. I absolutely loved that the Hayley Atwell was a bad driver. The action was good and there was also some unexpected dead pan humor that hit. A few notes was Luther always looks like he's about to cry with watery eyes and Ethan hunts Fitbit monitor stats must be insane. The key was a little over the top, like a pharaoh designed it thousand years ago, thought it should've been slick, it was state of the art technology after all.We got another train action sequence, I remember a previous mission impossible movie already had it. And I had just watched Indiana jones which also had an extensive train action sequence, this was better but still felt like a repeat. Of course knowing Tom cruise does all his stunts always elevates the thrill. I also didn't know it was part 1, feel like there's been a lot of them recently... fast X, Indiana jones and now this. I still think the self destruct messages are a little more over the top.The last of the third act had spectacular action sequences though, the tension and suspense, all the action before that was good not great. And that's the movie, very good but not great, slightly too long; but as far as first movie installments go this was exciting as you'd expect a mission impossible movie.",
    "113": "Another installment in the saga that rivals that of James Bond, starring the incombustible Tom Cruise. Death Reckoning Part 1 arrives as a solid action piece in which everything revolves around one key element, which, as is to be expected in the action genre, serves as an excuse to show all the spectacular sequences that the budget can afford. Considering that this is a super production, there will be action scenes that will be iconic within the same saga, although without much foundation or originality, except for one.The directing and editing work stand out above the rest of the technical elements, resulting in a risky, adrenaline-fueled and dynamic film. The story has comic seasonings at times, alien to a saga without much comedy. The villain, in addition to seeming to be relentless and impossible to beat, has a rather interesting presence. The locations were very good, although it's something we all can expect from a movie like this.Now, the premise pretends to be intelligent, but deflates as the film goes on, entering a vicious circle that is too repetitive. Everything revolves around a key element, which, at a certain point, begins to make you dizzy from being mentioned so much. The length of the film could have been polished, taking out a couple of dead moments and lacking in rhythm that were evidently redundant.In general terms, Mission: Impossible Death Sentence Part 1 is entertaining, with a very interesting villain, but repetitive, unoriginal and very long.",
    "114": "Funny, several reviewers wanted to love the film more but seem to be disappointed. I was actually counting on at least a 9 out of 10 since the critics seemingly rated this rendition very high. I have always wondered what the critics was looking at versus audience. I have a set of male and female actors that I always support and Tom is one of them. He is old school movie star which I like. An old school movie star makes their work special for the fans, not for award shows.Sorry to say, this is not even in my top ten for this year and this is from someone who absolutely adores Tom Cruise. The last two beat this one by a mile. Not going to give anything away but what a disappointment and I thought they wouldn't jeopardize something that worked over something they thought they had to do so I am surprised about a major decision in the movie. Does Tom not have real or complete relationships with women? I can't tell based on how he gives women power then make them weak at the same time. Major fan of kickass women so this iteration disappointed me to the lowest level. How can you make someone who suppose to be an equivalent to you so weak in a 5 minute timespan. The additions were fine but does that mean you are supposed to take a good thing away? The stunts were great. First time ever, they elected not to show a stunt through and through so it must have failed. You will see what I'm talking about as you watch the movie. The one thing they did well with the script is to make sure everyone understood who was controlling the evil side. Not rushing to the finally next year!!",
    "115": "Went to see it to a theater because the ratings are so high here and on RT. Well I walked out after half the movie. So one can argue I can't rate it, but I just couldn't sit through this cheesy garbage anymore.Here is why - 1 you are going to watch bunch of old botox filled office worker looking white dudes play edgy, agile and capable man, and couple of straight sucker mom women play some \"sexy sharp and skilled\" chicks..? 2 They all suck at acting including Tom in this one.3 you going to listen to raging music soundtrack when nothing really is happening in the movie.4 the team of the main character look and act like they just need to retire. The whole thing seemed 90's in a bad way. So far what I am saying is that there is no edge, there is no thrill, lines are cheesy, story is stupid, and feels shallow AF. At the end I want to add : sure MI was never known to be well acted high quality movie, but at least there was some thrill and fun to them, well say good 6+ stars worth... But this was just a money making forgettable garbage. TV show quality (and I mean old TV, not even an Amazon streaming lol) And while they probably will still make millions I want my $15 back.",
    "116": "An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.",
    "117": "Tom Cruise is a guy who for the last 40 years has surrounded himself with good writers and directors. Robert Towne, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Robert Redford, Neil Jordan and many more.In that time he has learned what it takes to deliver a good product. Cruise is not here to pick up a big pay cheque. He is involved in all aspects of productions.In a summer where action films have disappointed, you can sense that a lot of thought was behind each scene in Dead Reckoning Part One.Jettisoning the different director approach. Christopher McQuarrie returns for the third time. He even takes time out to mimic other franchises, the Fiat car chase is very much James Bond from: For Your Eyes Only. Then there are call backs to Mission Impossible's own 27 years movie history. The train sequence was a call back to Brian de Palma's original.The McGuffin is a cruciform key which is in two parts. Possession of both parts with give the nation owning it untold powers. However there is a rogue AI system called the Entity.It has brought in a man called Gabriel (Esai Morales) to retrieve the cruciform key. Gabriel is an old enemy of Ethan Hawke (Tom Cruise.)Using the Bond formula of globetrotting around the world. Big action sequences and breathtaking stunts. This is a solid exciting movie. Partly overlong but Cruise and McQuarrie show that you can mix familiar ingredients and still come up with something new.",
    "118": "I walked out halfway through this movie.Bruce Geller would be terribly ashamed to have his name in the credits of this movie -- which has absolutely NO substantive basis in the REAL Mission: Impossible series -- which was based upon INTELLIGENCE, not slapstick non-comedy by a wannabe Inspector Cluso.Bruce Geller's REAL \"Impossible Missions Force\" implemented the Long-Con, to get the subjects to incriminate themselves, or to retrieve dangerous materials. And, the pilot was inspired by the movie Topkapi (1964), adapted to surreptitiously retrieve a nuclear bomb. The REAL Mission Impossible was as far away as it gets from shoot-em-up gansters - cowboys - superheros - cops & robbers, and even James Bond.Tom Cluso is so ignorant of the REAL Mission: Impossible, that he doesn't even know it is actually called the \"Impossible Missions Force\" (plural) -- printed in gold letters on the portfolio of agents' dossier -- in plain sight, at the beginning of most episodes to S04E19.Tom Cluso has stooped to the level of pandering to the consumers of comic books and hyper-violent video games, who can only follow a linear connect-the-dots children's plot of \"Where's Waldo,\" running from one string of catastrophies to another. Tom Cluso would do far better to produce a string of \"The Fugitive\" movies.This pair of movies is essentially Mr. Cruise's effort at a \"Lord of the Rings\" action journey... except here it is a journey for Lord of the ***s. Unfortunately, Tom Cruise is neither J. R. R. Tolkien, nor Peter Jackson, and MI-7a presents no archetypal or transformative journey, as Gerwig did in Barbie. MI-7a, pales in comparison to, the Bourne trilogy -- which captivatingly embodied the archetype of the fool's journey from ignorance to truth, and also false guilt to absolution (with parallels to the Manchurian Candidate).Other reviews laud the 35 second stunt which does not even show chute deployment while the motorcycle is falling, and omits any actual landing (all the way from Norway to Poland). The stunts are nowhere near as spectacular, with continuous reality, as in Point Break (2015) -- where the wingsuit scene lasted 2:30, at one point flying 5 feet above the ground at 120MPH, without any CGI or chroma key BS. Since Tom Cluso insists on doing many of his own stunts, they can NEVER be as dangerous or extreme as those done by true stunt professionals -- because the movie insurers prohibit such risky conduct when millions are at stake. Just look at what happened from a fatal accident in the 2019 production of Rust.So far as an effort to supplant the James Bond franchise, more discerning international audiences want more than action and stunts -- which the franchise has adapted and delivered in abundance. Tom Cluso simply cannot project the same sophistication -- like John Wayne was to Laurence Olivier. On the bright side, Hayley Atwell was an excellent casting choice -- apart from her gaunt appearance, instead of her normal weight as a real woman.I also disrespect the mixed use of film and video in this movie, which makes it problematic for 4K UHD release. Tom Cruise made a similar error by neglecting to shoot ultra fast fighter jets in High Frame Rate, for Top Gun Maverick.He hasn't saved movie theaters, he is diminishing their artistic value to that of a carnival ride. Gerwig's Barbie did far more for the industry - proving that psychology, art, and business actually can all coalesce.For a good list of intelligence & espionage movie, see the AFI Silver Spy Cinema series, list of 33 movies.",
    "119": "Once again Cruise proves he can entertain like no one else making movies today, running, jumping, driving motorcycles off cliffs. Another day with Mission Impossible.This is now director Chris McQuarrie's third Mission film, and by now he's settled into a comfortable groove: simple stories disguised by labyrinthine plots, multiple warring factions, noir-ish flavors punctuated by explosive action and stunts, little Hitchcock homages, etc. It's easy for people to criticize the MI films since they adhere to this basic formula, but the truth is that they are genuinely good filmmaking, old fashioned blockbusters with physical humor and a sense of delight. It's amazing how consistently excellent they've been, especially when similar blockbusters such as the (weirdly similar) Indy 5 are currently drowning in awfulness.Like the other Mission films, Dead Reckoning stands quite well on its own (even given the 'Part 1' it does possess a sense of closure, unlike most other films released this year). One of the reasons most will criticize the exposition scenes is that they are straining to make this 7th franchise installment palatable to first time viewers. Obviously how well this tactic works will depend on the audience member. What's certain, though, is that the movie only slows down for these scenes of Ethan planning with his team, and once they end the movie barrels forward unremittingly. The massive climax on the Orient Express is by turns intricate, thrilling, suspenseful, excessive, and perfect. The best studio film of the summer.",
    "120": "The only thing I didn't like about Tom Cruise's return to the screen as the indestructible IMF agent Ethan Hunt was that we'll have to wait a whole year for Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two.I thought maybe they were over-egging the pudding stretching a story across two long films, but that wasn't remotely an issue. Nearly three hours' of movie absolutely raced by.Honestly, what a fantastic film. Say what you will about what Tom Cruise gets up to away from the cameras, but the man knows how to make a cool action film that people want to watch in their hundreds of millions. Car chases, foot races, shootouts, spectacular action scenes that'll make your jaw drop and a villain worthy of a great action/espionage film - just when you think the franchise can't possibly get any better, it does. Oh man, does it ever.Cruise is good as Hunt, maybe a little wooden - I like that we are digging into his dark past. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are their usual dependable selves, the brains to Hunt's brawn. Loved Hayley Atwell (easy on the eye, too) and Cary Elwes. Easi Morales as Hunt's nemesis was disturbingly good.And did I mention the stunts?Wow. Wow. Wow. Roll on June 2024, so we can see how Dead Reckoning ends.",
    "121": "Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One is the first part of the big finale of the franchise, supposedly. This is the second big franchise this year that has had a part one of their final story, with the first being Fast X. I guess after Infinity War and Endgame all big franchises got it in their head they need a two-part epic finale to finish things. Now, if you've followed this franchise (especially since it first came out) to now, and have enjoyed most, if not all, installments of it there's no reason not to see this. Like every entry, it's a beautiful looking movie, with some impressive action set pieces. Pretty much all of them are done practically.The story is pretty simple, like all of them, even though they like to appear complex. In this one it boils down to Ethan Hun and his crew on the hunt for this special McGuffin device that will help them stop the main adversary from taking over the world. It's nothing really new, but people don't really see these movies for the storyline anyway.Although, I'll say I wasn't a big fan of the main villain. I never liked the trope that so many franchises that try to have a big finale try to do. You introduce a new main villain out of nowhere that's somehow majorly connected with our hero, and who has somehow been lurking behind the scenes all this time. It often feels forced and retroactive because it is. It felt forced when Spectre did it. It's not handled much better here. With that said, I did like the main henchwoman named Paris. She really felt like a James Bond or John Wick type character in the best way.While I've always liked James Bond more, I'm a long-time fan of this franchise. I own all the films and have seen most of them in theaters. There hasn't been an entry in the series that I've outright disliked, even M. I 2. I would say the franchise peaked with Ghost Protocol, though Rogue Nation is a close second. While M. I. 2 is technically the weakest, I would say Fallout is the one I enjoy the least. I would put this film on par with Fallout, though that opinion could easily change depending on how Part Two turns out.What I always loved about the M. I. films are the tension-filled, elaborate infiltration sequences. My favorites are in Ghost Protocol when they infiltrated the Kremlin and when Ethan scaled that large tower. In Rogue Nation there's this amazing sequence where Ethan infiltrates this underwater facility. Plus, the ending or Rogue Nation I feel is the strongest in the franchise. Nothing in Fallout or this movie has matched those sequences. These last couple films have relied mostly on over-the top stunts, making them feel like regular action movies. They're all done well, but it's not anymore impressive than stunts in previous film, and there aren't as much of the cool spy scenes as earlier in the franchise.It feels like there isn't much left to do with this franchise, which is why I'm glad it's coming to an end. I feel the same way about the fast franchise. Hopefully, Part Two can end things on a graceful note.Overall, like I said, if you're a long-time fan there's no reason not to watch this. It's the beginning of the end. If you love entertaining action movies there's no reason not to see this, especially if you're tired of blockbusters that are over-reliant on CGI.",
    "122": "Coming back to direct another installment of the acclaimed action franchise Christopher McQuarrie. A runtime of two hours and forty-three minutes.\"Ethan Hunt\" played by Tom Cruise is back. After an A. I. goes rogue and starts causing havoc everything is up for grabs. Something that was deemed impossible is now possible. If it's online nothing is safe.This A. I./entity pulls \"Gabriel\" played by Esai Morales and his lackey \"Paris\" played by Pom Klementieff to do the task it physically can't do. \"Gabriel\" is an old foe of \"Ethan\".There is only one thing that can maybe stop or control this entity, a master key made from two keys. It's a world race to get these keys. Because whoever has them will have the most powerful thing in the world making them the single most powerful person or nation in the world.Now deemed a rouge agent again by \"Kittridge\" played by Henry Czerny. \"Ethan's\" team consisting of \"Luther\" played by Ving Rhames, \"Benji\" played by Simon Pegg, \"IIsa\" played by Rebecca Ferguson, and a new wild card in \"Grace\" played by Hayley Atwell will try and get these keys. Doing whatever needs to be done to stop it.Whether it's \"Ethan's\" own nation-sending operatives like \"Briggs\" played by Shea Whigham and \"Degas\" played by Greg Tarzan Davis. Other criminals like \"The White Widow\" played by Vanessa Kirby.This will be another mission impossible. \"Ethan\" will try to get these keys while the entity and \"Gabriel\" do everything in their power to stop them. Which isn't hard because they seem like they know their every move before they even make it.\"Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning part one\" was good. The last film was great in my opinion. This one lacked in certain areas. The bad Guy was A. I. That's kind of hard to fight so they added an old foe which whom we have no rapport.It felt rushed even though they've been shooting this film for a while now. Certain characters that are very pivotal to the storyline were only introduced in this film. Which is a misstep. All these films and you couldn't use someone that was in a previous film.Then they wanted you to get the connection to some of these new characters and it just wasn't happening. It was annoying that \"Ethan\" was so attached to newbies. I will say the newbie bad guy \"Paris\" was a badass. Pom Klementieff played that character well. But even that fell short of what that character should've been. I don't know what's going on but something was off with that script.There wasn't an actual impossible mission at least not one that felt impossible. For this to be a two-part film they are going to have to knock the next film out of the park. This didn't do it. On a side note, A. I. just arrived. It's in everything and talked about everywhere. I hope we don't exhaust this topic before it even lifts off.It had the feel of a MIP film. But the really good action scenes were in spurts. They talked about and showed the big stunt everywhere so by the time the scene popped up in the film it lost all of its thunder. I give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin\n#CosmoMovieBlog\n#CosmoLanier\n#MissionImpossibleDeadReckoningpartone.",
    "123": "This movie is like watching paint dry, a spit in the face to the audience.This generic ass movie has been made 100 million times already, there's nothing unique about it, it's just the same \"good guy, bad guy, hot girl, hot guy\" concept.I didn't feel a shred of emotion during any part of the movie.And the conversations the characters have about the \"entity\" put me to sleep.The only focus of this movie is the high octane \"sexual tension\" between Grace and Ethan.So if you have fantasies about a hot dangerous man sweeping you off your feet one day\n(or being the hot dangerous guy)\nThen this movie is for you. Unfortunately that is not for me.Give me 291M USD and I'm making a movie that's infinitely better than this, geniuenly.Either the creator hates cinema or this is what the audience wanted, the least controversial and most braindead film ever.",
    "124": "Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has a new mission. He has to find a key to defeat an evil AI. Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) join him on the mission. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) has one half of the key. Paris (Pom Klementieff) is a bounty hunter. Gabriel (Esai Morales) is the evil villain. Kittridge (Henry Czerny) is sending Briggs (Shea Whigham) to retrieve Ethan who is going rogue again. Ethan gets entangled with professional pickpocket Grace (Hayley Atwell). The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) is looking for the key as well as every government in the world.Tom Cruise is doing his running and trying to save cinema all by his lonesome. If all he needs is a good movie, he can hang the Mission Accomplished banner. This is a good movie. It's actually good and a bit of a surprise that it's not a mess. The convoluted plot is very understandable. The AI is actually scary. It's not just another psycho killer like Gabriel. The AI is actually real-world scary. Hayley Atwell is a great addition and her character is very compelling. I can see her as a fun part of the cast going forward. I do have a couple of complaints. First, the bridge fight needs to be more one-sided. Gabriel needs overwhelming advantage especially since it was carefully set up by the AI. It speaks to the power of the AI. The AI wouldn't waste its time on a 50/50 fight. Second, Grace needs to take the money. It's in her nature. I get the premise. She's turning away from her nature to do good. You know what's a better premise. She takes the money AND steals the key anyways. Now for the stunts, they are amazing. The motorcycle jump doesn't look as scary as it could be. That scene has great humor to start. They just need to mount the camera on the motorcycle and make the audience fly off the cliff with Tom. The Venice chase is the best. It's a genius move to use the smaller car. The train sequence starts off looking like it's been done before. When they start going off one at a time, that is pure stunt fun and the actors show their work. Everybody comes to see the actors doing the stunts. In addition, this one does have a compelling villain and not just another bad guy.",
    "125": "Tom Cruise still cant hang up his ego. This is the worst franchise in history. Character development is like watching CW. Action and stunt scenes are rehashed from the first 6 movies. Seriously, not worth it to watch the same 6 plots rolled into one film.Thats ok because everyday working people do the same thing day in and day out just like this last film.There is nothing different about Cruise's acting, same card board cut out technique, same action and stunts, truly there is nothing in this film that makes it unique or stand out. If this is all Cruise has to offer to his generation, its not worth it.David Bautista and Cillian Murphy have better sense to let themselves fall into this cookie cutter, copycat of action films with out the complexity of character development.Garbage thats not worth any money.",
    "126": "Tom Cruise tells his friends several times to \"figure it out\" during the movie, which is exactly what McQuarrie and Cruise are doing behind the scenes. McQuarrie and Cruise is the greatest duo in the history of action cinema. Every movie they make takes a huge leap forward in advancing the genre.They modify real cars and build real trains. Most impressively they invent new ways to capture complex action effectively. It's one thing to perform the death-defying stunts, but it's a completely different sport to actually capture the action and edit it in a way that fully appreciates the actual stunts and lets the viewer understand what's going on. What's the point of doing the stunt if the audience can not fully appreciate it?The behind-the-scenes footage is almost as good as the movie itself. It's crazy to see what goes down before they even shoot the stunts. They invent new cameras to capture it properly and they build huge ramps to practice countless hours.Everybody knows how impressive the stunts are, but what few people seem to realize is how great the writing is. If you want to make a great action movie you should study this franchise. The crew comes up with these crazy set pieces and then they write the story. When actors are cast, their roles are tailored for them specifically which makes everything very natural. However, one of the most important aspects of this franchise's success is the constant time pressure.This is the seventh entry in this franchise and it's still so stressful and intense. Our heroes are constantly fighting a battle with the clock. It doesn't matter what they are doing; they are always in a hurry or something bad will happen. Another vital aspect is the constant escalation of events.Just when you think the crew is out of danger, something even worse happens. Just when you think they are done, a bigger and steeper mountain stands in front of them. It's so intense. I was holding my hat in my left hand and when the action was over and the audience got some breathing room, I noticed how hard I had been squashing my hat. You are constantly on the edge of your seat and time will pass surprisingly fast. I was in the zone; I couldn't feel my body because I was so focused on the movie screen.The new additions to the already fantastic cast are phenomenal. Hayley Atwell does more than hold her own against Cruise. She is the main attraction in many of their shared scenes. Not only is her acting superb, but her dedication to performing the stunts is awe-inspiring.This movie does have a little more downtime than Fallout and part of that is due to the romance between Hayley and Cruise. Cruise has to look out for her and she gets almost as much screen time as Cruise does. This is not bad but it does differ from previous iterations. The stakes are higher and Ethan cares more about his friends' life than his own.Every Mission movie stands on its own. This movie does at times move a bit slowly with a lot of exposition. Sometimes you wish that they would just get on with the action. And when they do, they blow your socks off.This is actually a spy movie. The first half is very different compared to the previous movies with a lot of intense and suspenseful espionage. The enemy in this movie is an AI which feels very fitting considering the current state of the world. It's not only an intense, entertaining action movie - it also makes you think about advanced technology's role in our world. What happens if it goes rogue? Should any person have access to this weapon of mass destruction?What a fun movie. When the movie started I was looking for a seatbelt. I was almost convinced that the cinema would take off like a plane. Do yourself a favor and watch it on the biggest screen you can. Your body will be rocking around in your chair when the sound is booming. A very intense, stressful, and funniest entry in the franchise so far.",
    "127": "Wow.. I dont even know where to begin.. this was just an insane, nailbiting and mesmorizing cinematic experience, that you should treat yourself to if you liked the previous MI-movies or just movies in this genre!With this movie, Tom Cruise performed the insane stunts, that only he can performe! You cant imagine anyway he can outdo himself, but he really manages to do that with this movie! Just.. wow really!Despite the fact that this is the 7'th installment and a part one of.. Two? This movie was an edge of your seat thrillride from beginning to end, with imesurable stakes, as they face the greatest threat yet! This might be the best of the franchise.. only time will tell!This franchise has not lost ANY steam.. AT ALL, And Tom Cruise is going above and beyond with this one!",
    "128": "Another installment in the saga that rivals that of James Bond, starring the incombustible Tom Cruise. Death Reckoning Part 1 arrives as a solid action piece in which everything revolves around one key element, which, as is to be expected in the action genre, serves as an excuse to show all the spectacular sequences that the budget can afford. Considering that this is a super production, there will be action scenes that will be iconic within the same saga, although without much foundation or originality, except for one.The directing and editing work stand out above the rest of the technical elements, resulting in a risky, adrenaline-fueled and dynamic film. The story has comic seasonings at times, alien to a saga without much comedy. The villain, in addition to seeming to be relentless and impossible to beat, has a rather interesting presence. The locations were very good, although it's something we all can expect from a movie like this.Now, the premise pretends to be intelligent, but deflates as the film goes on, entering a vicious circle that is too repetitive. Everything revolves around a key element, which, at a certain point, begins to make you dizzy from being mentioned so much. The length of the film could have been polished, taking out a couple of dead moments and lacking in rhythm that were evidently redundant.In general terms, Mission: Impossible Death Sentence Part 1 is entertaining, with a very interesting villain, but repetitive, unoriginal and very long.",
    "129": "Funny, several reviewers wanted to love the film more but seem to be disappointed. I was actually counting on at least a 9 out of 10 since the critics seemingly rated this rendition very high. I have always wondered what the critics was looking at versus audience. I have a set of male and female actors that I always support and Tom is one of them. He is old school movie star which I like. An old school movie star makes their work special for the fans, not for award shows.Sorry to say, this is not even in my top ten for this year and this is from someone who absolutely adores Tom Cruise. The last two beat this one by a mile. Not going to give anything away but what a disappointment and I thought they wouldn't jeopardize something that worked over something they thought they had to do so I am surprised about a major decision in the movie. Does Tom not have real or complete relationships with women? I can't tell based on how he gives women power then make them weak at the same time. Major fan of kickass women so this iteration disappointed me to the lowest level. How can you make someone who suppose to be an equivalent to you so weak in a 5 minute timespan. The additions were fine but does that mean you are supposed to take a good thing away? The stunts were great. First time ever, they elected not to show a stunt through and through so it must have failed. You will see what I'm talking about as you watch the movie. The one thing they did well with the script is to make sure everyone understood who was controlling the evil side. Not rushing to the finally next year!!",
    "130": "Went to see it to a theater because the ratings are so high here and on RT. Well I walked out after half the movie. So one can argue I can't rate it, but I just couldn't sit through this cheesy garbage anymore.Here is why - 1 you are going to watch bunch of old botox filled office worker looking white dudes play edgy, agile and capable man, and couple of straight sucker mom women play some \"sexy sharp and skilled\" chicks..? 2 They all suck at acting including Tom in this one.3 you going to listen to raging music soundtrack when nothing really is happening in the movie.4 the team of the main character look and act like they just need to retire. The whole thing seemed 90's in a bad way. So far what I am saying is that there is no edge, there is no thrill, lines are cheesy, story is stupid, and feels shallow AF. At the end I want to add : sure MI was never known to be well acted high quality movie, but at least there was some thrill and fun to them, well say good 6+ stars worth... But this was just a money making forgettable garbage. TV show quality (and I mean old TV, not even an Amazon streaming lol) And while they probably will still make millions I want my $15 back.",
    "131": "An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.",

He is involved in all aspects of productions.In a summer where action films have disappointed, you can sense that a lot of thought was behind each scene in Dead Reckoning Part One.Jettisoning the different director approach. Christopher McQuarrie returns for the third time. He even takes time out to mimic other franchises, the Fiat car chase is very much James Bond from: For Your Eyes Only.

Possession of both parts with give the nation owning it untold powers. However there is a rogue AI system called the Entity.It has brought in a man called Gabriel (Esai Morales) to retrieve the cruciform key. Gabriel is an old enemy of Ethan Hawke (Tom Cruise.)Using the Bond formula of globetrotting around the world. Big action sequences and breathtaking stunts. This is a solid exciting movie.

It's nothing really new, but people don't really see these movies for the storyline anyway.Although, I'll say I wasn't a big fan of the main villain. I never liked the trope that so many franchises that try to have a big finale try to do. You introduce a new main villain out of nowhere that's somehow majorly connected with our hero, and who has somehow been lurking behind the scenes all this time. It often feels forced and retroactive because it is. It felt forced when Spectre did it. It's not handled much better here. With that said, I did like the main henchwoman named Paris. She really felt like a James Bond or John Wick type character in the best way.While I've always liked James Bond more, I'm a long-time fan of this franchise. I own all the films and have seen most of them in theaters. There hasn't been an entry in the series that I've outright disliked, even M. I 2. I would say the franchise peaked with Ghost Protocol, though Rogue Nation is a close second. While M. I. 2 is technically the weakest, I would say Fallout is the one I enjoy the least. I would put this film on par with Fallout, though that opinion could easily change depending on how Part Two turns out.What I always loved about the M. I. films are the tension-filled, elaborate infiltration sequences. My favorites are in Ghost Protocol when they infiltrated the Kremlin and when Ethan scaled that large tower. In Rogue Nation there's this amazing sequence where Ethan infiltrates this underwater facility. Plus, the ending or Rogue Nation I feel is the strongest in the franchise. Nothing in Fallout or this movie has matched those sequences. These last couple films have relied mostly on over-the top stunts, making them feel like regular action movies. They're all done well, but it's not anymore impressive than stunts in previous film, and there aren't as much of the cool spy scenes as earlier in the franchise.It feels like there isn't much left to do with this franchise, which is why I'm glad it's coming to an end. I feel the same way about the fast franchise. Hopefully, Part Two can end things on a graceful note.Overall, like I said, if you're a long-time fan there's no reason not to watch this. It's the beginning of the end. If you love entertaining action movies there's no reason not to see this, especially if you're tired of blockbusters that are over-reliant on CGI.",
    "137": "Coming back to direct another installment of the acclaimed action franchise Christopher McQuarrie. A runtime of two hours and forty-three minutes.\"Ethan Hunt\" played by Tom Cruise is back. After an A. I. goes rogue and starts causing havoc everything is up for grabs. Something that was deemed impossible is now possible. If it's online nothing is safe.This A. I./entity pulls \"Gabriel\" played by Esai Morales and his lackey \"Paris\" played by Pom Klementieff to do the task it physically can't do. \"Gabriel\" is an old foe of \"Ethan\".There is only one thing that can maybe stop or control this entity, a master key made from two keys. It's a world race to get these keys. Because whoever has them will have the most powerful thing in the world making them the single most powerful person or nation in the world.Now deemed a rouge agent again by \"Kittridge\" played by Henry Czerny. \"Ethan's\" team consisting of \"Luther\" played by Ving Rhames, \"Benji\" played by Simon Pegg, \"IIsa\" played by Rebecca Ferguson, and a new wild card in \"Grace\" played by Hayley Atwell will try and get these keys. Doing whatever needs to be done to stop it.Whether it's \"Ethan's\" own nation-sending operatives like \"Briggs\" played by Shea Whigham and \"Degas\" played by Greg Tarzan Davis. Other criminals like \"The White Widow\" played by Vanessa Kirby.This will be another mission impossible. \"Ethan\" will try to get these keys while the entity and \"Gabriel\" do everything in their power to stop them. Which isn't hard because they seem like they know their every move before they even make it.\"Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning part one\" was good. The last film was great in my opinion. This one lacked in certain areas. The bad Guy was A. I. That's kind of hard to fight so they added an old foe which whom we have no rapport.It felt rushed even though they've been shooting this film for a while now. Certain characters that are very pivotal to the storyline were only introduced in this film. Which is a misstep. All these films and you couldn't use someone that was in a previous film.Then they wanted you to get the connection to some of these new characters and it just wasn't happening. It was annoying that \"Ethan\" was so attached to newbies. I will say the newbie bad guy \"Paris\" was a badass. Pom Klementieff played that character well. But even that fell short of what that character should've been. I don't know what's going on but something was off with that script.There wasn't an actual impossible mission at least not one that felt impossible. For this to be a two-part film they are going to have to knock the next film out of the park. This didn't do it. On a side note, A. I. just arrived. It's in everything and talked about everywhere. I hope we don't exhaust this topic before it even lifts off.It had the feel of a MIP film. But the really good action scenes were in spurts. They talked about and showed the big stunt everywhere so by the time the scene popped up in the film it lost all of its thunder. I give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin\n#CosmoMovieBlog\n#CosmoLanier\n#MissionImpossibleDeadReckoningpartone.",
    "138": "This movie is like watching paint dry, a spit in the face to the audience.This generic ass movie has been made 100 million times already, there's nothing unique about it, it's just the same \"good guy, bad guy, hot girl, hot guy\" concept.I didn't feel a shred of emotion during any part of the movie.And the conversations the characters have about the \"entity\" put me to sleep.The only focus of this movie is the high octane \"sexual tension\" between Grace and Ethan.So if you have fantasies about a hot dangerous man sweeping you off your feet one day\n(or being the hot dangerous guy)\nThen this movie is for you. Unfortunately that is not for me.Give me 291M USD and I'm making a movie that's infinitely better than this, geniuenly.Either the creator hates cinema or this is what the audience wanted, the least controversial and most braindead film ever.",
    "139": "Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has a new mission. He has to find a key to defeat an evil AI. Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) join him on the mission. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) has one half of the key. Paris (Pom Klementieff) is a bounty hunter. Gabriel (Esai Morales) is the evil villain. Kittridge (Henry Czerny) is sending Briggs (Shea Whigham) to retrieve Ethan who is going rogue again. Ethan gets entangled with professional pickpocket Grace (Hayley Atwell). The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) is looking for the key as well as every government in the world.Tom Cruise is doing his running and trying to save cinema all by his lonesome. If all he needs is a good movie, he can hang the Mission Accomplished banner. This is a good movie. It's actually good and a bit of a surprise that it's not a mess. The convoluted plot is very understandable. The AI is actually scary. It's not just another psycho killer like Gabriel. The AI is actually real-world scary. Hayley Atwell is a great addition and her character is very compelling. I can see her as a fun part of the cast going forward. I do have a couple of complaints. First, the bridge fight needs to be more one-sided. Gabriel needs overwhelming advantage especially since it was carefully set up by the AI. It speaks to the power of the AI. The AI wouldn't waste its time on a 50/50 fight. Second, Grace needs to take the money. It's in her nature. I get the premise. She's turning away from her nature to do good. You know what's a better premise. She takes the money AND steals the key anyways. Now for the stunts, they are amazing. The motorcycle jump doesn't look as scary as it could be. That scene has great humor to start. They just need to mount the camera on the motorcycle and make the audience fly off the cliff with Tom. The Venice chase is the best. It's a genius move to use the smaller car. The train sequence starts off looking like it's been done before. When they start going off one at a time, that is pure stunt fun and the actors show their work. Everybody comes to see the actors doing the stunts. In addition, this one does have a compelling villain and not just another bad guy.",
    "140": "Tom Cruise still cant hang up his ego. This is the worst franchise in history. Character development is like watching CW. Action and stunt scenes are rehashed from the first 6 movies. Seriously, not worth it to watch the same 6 plots rolled into one film.Thats ok because everyday working people do the same thing day in and day out just like this last film.There is nothing different about Cruise's acting, same card board cut out technique, same action and stunts, truly there is nothing in this film that makes it unique or stand out. If this is all Cruise has to offer to his generation, its not worth it.David Bautista and Cillian Murphy have better sense to let themselves fall into this cookie cutter, copycat of action films with out the complexity of character development.Garbage thats not worth any money.",
    "141": "Tom Cruise tells his friends several times to \"figure it out\" during the movie, which is exactly what McQuarrie and Cruise are doing behind the scenes. McQuarrie and Cruise is the greatest duo in the history of action cinema. Every movie they make takes a huge leap forward in advancing the genre.They modify real cars and build real trains. Most impressively they invent new ways to capture complex action effectively. It's one thing to perform the death-defying stunts, but it's a completely different sport to actually capture the action and edit it in a way that fully appreciates the actual stunts and lets the viewer understand what's going on. What's the point of doing the stunt if the audience can not fully appreciate it?The behind-the-scenes footage is almost as good as the movie itself. It's crazy to see what goes down before they even shoot the stunts. They invent new cameras to capture it properly and they build huge ramps to practice countless hours.Everybody knows how impressive the stunts are, but what few people seem to realize is how great the writing is. If you want to make a great action movie you should study this franchise. The crew comes up with these crazy set pieces and then they write the story. When actors are cast, their roles are tailored for them specifically which makes everything very natural. However, one of the most important aspects of this franchise's success is the constant time pressure.This is the seventh entry in this franchise and it's still so stressful and intense. Our heroes are constantly fighting a battle with the clock. It doesn't matter what they are doing; they are always in a hurry or something bad will happen. Another vital aspect is the constant escalation of events.Just when you think the crew is out of danger, something even worse happens. Just when you think they are done, a bigger and steeper mountain stands in front of them. It's so intense. I was holding my hat in my left hand and when the action was over and the audience got some breathing room, I noticed how hard I had been squashing my hat. You are constantly on the edge of your seat and time will pass surprisingly fast. I was in the zone; I couldn't feel my body because I was so focused on the movie screen.The new additions to the already fantastic cast are phenomenal. Hayley Atwell does more than hold her own against Cruise. She is the main attraction in many of their shared scenes. Not only is her acting superb, but her dedication to performing the stunts is awe-inspiring.This movie does have a little more downtime than Fallout and part of that is due to the romance between Hayley and Cruise. Cruise has to look out for her and she gets almost as much screen time as Cruise does. This is not bad but it does differ from previous iterations. The stakes are higher and Ethan cares more about his friends' life than his own.Every Mission movie stands on its own. This movie does at times move a bit slowly with a lot of exposition. Sometimes you wish that they would just get on with the action. And when they do, they blow your socks off.This is actually a spy movie. The first half is very different compared to the previous movies with a lot of intense and suspenseful espionage. The enemy in this movie is an AI which feels very fitting considering the current state of the world. It's not only an intense, entertaining action movie - it also makes you think about advanced technology's role in our world. What happens if it goes rogue? Should any person have access to this weapon of mass destruction?What a fun movie. When the movie started I was looking for a seatbelt. I was almost convinced that the cinema would take off like a plane. Do yourself a favor and watch it on the biggest screen you can. Your body will be rocking around in your chair when the sound is booming. A very intense, stressful, and funniest entry in the franchise so far.",
    "142": "Wow.. I dont even know where to begin.. this was just an insane, nailbiting and mesmorizing cinematic experience, that you should treat yourself to if you liked the previous MI-movies or just movies in this genre!With this movie, Tom Cruise performed the insane stunts, that only he can performe! You cant imagine anyway he can outdo himself, but he really manages to do that with this movie! Just.. wow really!Despite the fact that this is the 7'th installment and a part one of.. Two? This movie was an edge of your seat thrillride from beginning to end, with imesurable stakes, as they face the greatest threat yet! This might be the best of the franchise.. only time will tell!This franchise has not lost ANY steam.. AT ALL, And Tom Cruise is going above and beyond with this one!",
    "143": "I feel there needs to be a counter balance to all the over the top hyperbole about this movie - while it stands out from current action movies, that's more about the poor quality of the others more than anything.The plot is super generic, the villains cartoonish and the stakes seem lower than they should be.The action, while shot practically, doesn't look all that realistic - it almost like there's a gloss placed over the final result to make it look less real somehow! The big action set piece involving the motorbike jumping off the mountain looks less real than similar stunts from movies from 40 years ago, and you wouldn't know Cruise performed the stunt if it wasn't hyped to the nth degree. The fight scenes look bland compared to the likes of the John Wick movies as well.Is it a bad movie? Not at all, but far from being the greatest action movie the reviews here suggest. Top Gun Maverick is far more worthy of that title.",
    "144": "I had a lot of fun in Dead Reckoning. I didn't enjoy it as much as the 4th and 6th. But still this movie was pretty impressive. Let me talk about all the good first.This movie is filled with intense sequences. And I don't mean just the action. Because of the plot of this movie involving a rogue AI, which is taking over the digital world, there is a lot of suspense in this movie and you can never be certain of what's believable and what's not. I surprisingly really enjoyed some of the plot twists. This is actually also a very fun spy movie.The first half has 2 amazing sequences. One involving a certain operation at an airport, and another involving a car chase in Rome. Both these sequences were relentlessly entertaining, filled with intensity as well as a surprising amount of humour. There is a scene towards the end where a certain train is falling, and that was easily one of the most creative and intense action set pieces in recent times.Haley Atwell's performance (other than Tom Cruise, of course) stood out in this movie and her character was a great addition to this franchise.There are still things I didn't like though. The villain in this movie (not the AI, but the one working for the AI), was just so boring. Everything about him was just boring. He wasn't even worthy of doing the gutsy villain stuff that he did here. That made it more frustrating. The subplot involving the damsel in distress trope was disappointing too. The second half of this movie is fun, but it wasn't as fun as the incredibly entertaining first half. And some action sequences in the second half (especially the one where they fight on top of a train) were a bit too convenient and coincidental, which took me out of the movie.But overall I am impressed with this movie as well as the consistency of this franchise. I'm looking forward to part 2. I hope the film staff keeps up all the great work.",
    "145": "(Review after the pre-screening in IMAX)\nQuite possibly the best in the series thus far!Action-packed from start to finish with high production value and clever dialogue. This film has a charm to it, and will keep you amazed by its brio.It reminded me of the good ol' summer blockbusters from like 20 years ago... it's a popcorn movie with basically nonstop action, however, it somehow manages to not seem dumb and also doesn't make you feel like you're losing IQ by watching it, which very few films of this genre managed to accomplish as of late.Cruise is fantastic as usual, this is THE role he, as an actor, will be remembered for.Hayley Atwell is a great addition as well.From the technical standpoint - there isn't anything really worth criticising... I would have to be nitpicking problems that - in this genre - aren't really problems.Camera and editing are great!One thing I'd point out though is, and that's just my personal and subjective opinion, the \"take home message\" about the dangers of the sentient AI that is imminent in the real world could have been stressed a little more... I doubt there will be people coming home from the theatre thinking \"bloody hell what if something like this happens for real\"... it kinda stays within the realms of the film itself and the repercussions of creating such an AI will most likely not be felt by the audience that isn't particularly tech-savvy or doesn't keep up with the current advances in the tech world.To sum up; Definitely worth your time, worth your money, matches or exceeds expectations, one of the best if not the best in the franchise. See it in IMAX if possible, but normal theatre is gonna work as well.8.5/10 for me.Looking forward to watching Part Two next year.",
    "146": "Except for Tom Cruise?He did it again boys. And congrats to all involved.Strong scenario? Yes, very interesting idea and one of the most intriguing opening scenes.Strong villain? Two of them, both exceptional and intimidating in their own ways.Action? It is there and it is solid. The car hunt scene and the train scene near the end of the film are two of the best actions scenes I have ever seen. And they are both in the same movie. Jumping off cliffs with bikes? Shootings in the desert? You name it.Cinematography? Yes, interesting locations are used throughout the film.Plot holes? Minor, nothing out of the ordinary for this type of film.Acting? Solid, as good as can be for an action movie.Directing? Great, especially the action scenes are very suspenseful.Overused characters/Overabundance of characters? No, I am happy to say that every one had a useful part in the film which was well timed.Forced diversity? Nope, there are strong female leads which feel natural and blend well with their male counterparts. This creates tension and lots of interesting pathways for the film.Too long? No, it is a 3-hour movie but it is so well paced that you wouldn't notice. I would even say that cutting scenes might have left gaps and do more harm than good.Climax? Yes, although we knew there would be a second part the movie managed to create its own tension for the first part and end on a high note, in its own right.If I could knock something from the movie, that would be the lots of pick-pocketing. Come on guys, you are spies not magicians. Take it down a notch.A perfect summer action film and I will definitely be waiting for the second part.8/10.",
    "147": "On the 7th installment of the popular and lucrative film franchise Ethan Hunt and co. Take on a new task and as always all hell breaks loose. Pitted against the \"Entity\", a nemesis of mythological proportions the group must make use of their vast and impressive talents and resources to tackle and defeat such a seemingly insurmountable foe. Taking the viewer on a wild ride one is immediately subject to car chases, skilled fistfights, gunfire and things being smashed and thrown about. The varied locations the series is known for is on full display as scenic views alternate with grimy back alleys as backdrop to the nonstop action. What's funny is the breathless rush of the film's pace with it's in your face action is its biggest weakness. Suffering from the \"John Wick\" syndrome of compensating a shaky plot with endless head-busting the tired and worn action cliches wear out at once leaving one in paint-drying tedium. The film could have benefitted from good editing and a shorter length. Tom Cruise looks fine and can still carry the film but age is beginning to show. This film being the penultimate in wrapping up the series would benefit him and the franchise nicely. If anything it's good to see Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames and Rebecca Ferguson together onscreen again. One of cinema's longest and best series this latest entry is one you wouldn't mind seeing.",

As always , Tom 's love for cinema never disappoints.The movie will leave you breathless every moment , the action scenes are insane , every character in the movie kills their roles so well . Personally, I really like the sound of the movie, it feels like it's touching my body.I really like Tom Cruise's character Ethan Hunt because of his determination to protect, do all he can to save people (it's a pity that there is a character I really want to be happy with Ethan).I am a fan of Tom Cruise and especially his Mission Impossible series, I have personally enjoyed and watched this series over and over again.
