    "0": "This is by far the worst script of the trilogy.The story is 80% denzel on holiday in Amalfi coastal village where he sips tea, watches locals and dines out all day. And then at the end kills a few bad guys - but at some point in 3rd act he offers himself up but bad mafia guys decide not to end his life in front of the village people and end this miserable excuse of a movie. You almost wish they shot him to make it a tiny bit realistic and challenging.Oh and during his holiday which makes no sense at all and drags on like a slow Cond√© Nast tourist trip - it finally explains its lame story started because of some pensioner got hacked so he flew to recup 360k in cash and admits he does not even know the guy - huh?? Which feels more hollow than the shallow story - but let's not digress because the big reveal moment is the thinly written part of Dakota Fanning who asks did you pick me- duh - because she is daughter of his old boss. Really?This could have been revealed in 2nd act and made for a great story plot instead of 2 dimensional thin character that just acts like a teenager on holiday and definitely not CIA material - bad casting as Dakota best part is getting almost blown up. Good riddance but she survives.The entire film feels like a bad Charles Bronson movie from 70s and even the bad guys are pathetic characterization of the Italian Camora aka mafia.No idea how this film got such high ratings but by far the worst of the series and Denzel must have a Villa in Amalfi coast or family wanted a sweet holiday. Go in with super low expectations and you might enjoy the Italian scenery because there is not much equalizing - but loads of social dining. Maybe next film will include a Greek wedding4 stars to the food,fish, and tea - and Amalfi villages.",
    "1": "Robert McCall, seriously wounded during operational activity, recuperates in the incredibly picturesque costal Italian town of Altamonte, a place where comes to feel he may find peace of mind. Two things happen while he is mending: he sends some intel he discovered during the op anonymously to his old organisation, and he realises that a group of mafia lowlifes are making things bad for local residents. These two threads intertwine.Denzel Washington's 3rd outing as McCall takes us to more exotic locations, gives another nasty slow build but, fear not, we get a fair amount of action norwithstanding our protagonist being out of commission for much of the action.I really like McCall. There is something very satisfying in seeing an enormously sympathetic and likeable character who is capable of turning on a sixpence, and doing what they do to violent, repellent people, only doing it better. And with a cold, matter-of-fact lack of emotion.There were a lot of moments I lked here, chief among them a shockingly well realised explosion, and an ending setting up McCall, recent victim of a severe woung, outnumbered against a powerful, well armed and organised foe. And a brief callback to the two previous films caught me by surprise.",
    "2": "THE EQUALIZER (2023) *** Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Eugenio Mastrandrea, David Denman, Gaia Scodellaro, Remo Girone, Andrea Scarduzio, Andrea Dodero. The final chapter in the trilogy of the adaptation of the '80s tv series with Washington's Robert McCall attempting retirement in a Sicilian sleepy village where he finds the locals under the threat of the drug cartel led by Scarduzio which leads to a personal vendetta with copious bloodshed and retribution. Nice to see the MAN ON FIRE reunion of Washington and Fanning as a fed helping to snub out the gangsters. Washington is in fine form as the stil-waters-run-deep assassin whose dexterity never continues to surprise nor its ingenious gory outcomes. A fitting last dance (for now) directed with brio by Antoine Fuqua who helmed the series with aplomb.",
    "3": "Was forever searching up Equalizer 3 on Google sine the 2nd film & it was always just plain speculation. It was only until early this year though, that we would be getting a 3rd & until I discovered recently, a final entry in the Equalizer Franchise. I was hoping this would be good, but sadly it didn't quite hit the mark.The film sees Robert McCall who finds himself at home in Southern Italy, but, he discovers his friends are under the control of local crime bosses. As events turn deadly, McCall knows what he has to do: become his friends' protector by taking on the mafia.I found the film to be pretty weak. For starters, there's literally no action & any of that action that we see here, is way too few & far between. The story makes no sense whatsoever & it didn't help that a lot of the dialogue was foreign & subtitled as if the plot was hard enough to grasp as it was.Our main man just plods along after a killer opening for nearly a good hour & I found myself feeling frustrated with the fact that he wasn't doing what he did best. I mean, they could've easily had him go about his day-today life in Sicily & had him kicking arse & taking care of business, but no. We get a weak & flat film that drags along & along for 60% of the film. Disappointing.The action was good & the ending wasn't bad despite being weak in itself. I mean, just letting the main bad guy fumble about like a drunken lout throthing like a rabid rot wiler dog? No badarse fighting duel? Like I said, the gore was there & the action really deliver, but it was too few & far between.The film drags after the opening & if it's bad enough we don't get to see McCall doing what he does best, nothing remotely interetsing happens between the opening & the 3rd act. It's frustrating as given the first 2 films delivering like they did. I mean, did it not occur to the makers here that the film dragged on for a good hour with no action?This film seriously reminds me of Halloween Ends so much, a disappointing end to a promising trilogy. And to add insult to injury, this is the last one in the Franchise. What a way to send off the character for crying out loud...Despite the actors doing a good enough of a job in the 102 minute (1hr & 42min) film, it really lacked for me. The villains weren't even that interesting, not to mention their motivations.Overall, it's a disappointing & weak entry & final to the trilogy. From the lack of action, to the incoherent story to the dragged out feel to the ironically shortest film of the trilogy. This film really didn't cut the mustard & this is despite the gruesome action we got (what little of it) & characters who weren't all the interesting apart from the man himself ironically enough doing little to fa for 60% of the film. What a way to end the franchise. This is definitely the weakest one. Go watch it, but you'll be frustrated after the opening trust me.5/10.",
    "4": "There is a strong similarity between The Equalizer and the John Wick series (and the Taken movies too): with every entry the quality and entertainment level goes weaker and weaker. The first Equalizer movie was strong, the second not so strong and the third one is, well, acceptable, but nowhere near the quality of the first one. Anyway, if you love to watch Denzel Washington and just want some explosions and bum bum, you still can put this one on your to watch list. Production is solid, Denzel cool as ever, that's about it. My rate for the first one is 8, the second got a 6, this one gets a 5 but no more.",
    "5": "What a joke of a movie. The into was great with a 5 min action scene, and then that's it for about half of the movie. He limps around in an Italian village and heals and develops into a drama/romance.Perhaps Denzel is aging and can't keep up with all the Tom Cruise action movies, or perhaps he's tired and wanted to do other than shooting all the time. Fine. Just don't name this part of the Equalizer series as it's not really in the same ballpark.Perhaps he's using Equal, the sugar substitute in his tea and that's the inside joke.Dakota Fanning as a CIA agent investigating drugs and cartels? Totally miscast and poorly. She still looks 13 even wearing some grown up jeans spouting a few intelligent lines.The story itself is sub par. We wait and wait for any type of action, and then we get to the boss fight.. and he goes home to eat pasta. Laughing out loud at the writer.Then some poor action in the finale after the pasta, when everyone is tired from the carb loading. Incredibly poor. 7 and 8 star reviews are just insane.",
    "6": "It's been a while since I watched the first two Equalizers, but I remember them quite fondly as fun movies that found a nice balance between a simple yet effective story and brutal, well-made action scenes. So when I discovered that a third installmant was arriving soon, I was excited.Today, that excitement was shattered upon actually seeing the movie. The Equalizer 3 stars Denzel Washington, of course. And he is once again brilliant. The story here is that Denzel runs into an international drug trafficking ring by accident while trying to steal back his Uber driver's pension fund. The opening is amazing, showing off beautiful cinematography and a creative action sequence in true Equalizer style. Enjoy it while it lasts, because that's the last you'll see of that.After killing off a few mobsters, Denzel passes out by the side of the road and gets picked up by a random guy who just happens to be the son of a doctor who in turn just happens to like caring for random people with bullet wounds. Of course he is also called Enzo and he is an almost offensively stereotypical Italian. For the next hour or so, prepare to watch Denzel Washington drink tea. This movie contains more shots of Denzel drinking tea than it does of him firing a gun. In this little Italian town everyone loves Denzel for no apparent reason, to the point where random kids and grandmas walk up to him and give him gifts without even knowing him. There's a woman who basically throws herself at Washington from the second she sees him. Within a week, the people call him \"one of them\" and will literally die for him. It's just because he's American it seems, because he doesn't do much else. He watches the mafia terrorize the town and the people he apparently loves so much, but he doesn't actually get involved for weeks, not even when his favorite shop is burned to the ground.Meanwhile, there's a hesitant subplot where a CIA agent is investigating the drug trafficking ring. She comes to Italy but doesn't seem too bothered with investigating the actual criminals. She just hangs around harrassing Denzel, who is not even trying to hide that he's guilty of many murders at this point. She acts like she's this accomplished agent, but literally all she does is repeat Denzel's findings to her superiors and take the credit for them. She explodes somewhere halfway through the movie and they basically give her a promotion and a medal of honor for it.The mafia itself starts out quite menacing. They are well cast and very violent, but by the time Denzel finally starts killing them (over an hour into the movie) he immediately kills off all the good mobsters in an underwhelming 30 second shot. That's that then. Now all we have left is Victor, a stereotypical mob boss with not much character to him. He's just evil and he likes money and Ferraris. He is now real angry at Denzel for killing his brother and they have a standoff in the town square. It's quite cool and I was getting ready for an amazing shootout, but instead Victor just leaves to go eat spaghetti with his friends. I'm not kidding. This mob boss, apparently the head of five huge crime families, then goes to take a nap with only a few bodyguards around even though he knows this masterful assassin is hunting him down.The final action scene mostly just killed my last bit of hope for this movie. The kills are dull and are just Denzel picking off guards with a knife one by one in pitch dark rooms. Victor barely puts up a fight and basically dies by getting hit by a Fiat Punto. That was it. The final Equalizer movie is now over and it contained maybe three minutes of actual Equalizing, most of which was incredibly boring. The cinematography is quite beautiful at times, the acting is great across the board, the Italian vibes are amazing and there's a few good and/or funny lines. But overall this movie was just an incredible letdown. I don't mind a slow buildup, but this doesn't build up to anything. The first half could've been great if the second half had a proper payoff, but all Denzel does is drink more tea and kill maybe five people to bring down the entire Italian mafia. The romantic subplot that is set up gets no real conclusion, the ending suddenly introduces a weird plot point that was never mentioned before and then it ends abruptly.Not every action movie has to be John Wick with non-stop firepower, but I do expect there to be some actual action. The Equalizer 3 never really delivers. It's a very pretty display of the Amalfi coast and Denzel's acting, but that's about it. It's a shame.",
    "7": "This is the most Mithun- like film, that Mithun never did. The story line is thinner than a wafer and has a more laughable plot than a Woodhouse. The villain is more sinister than Thanos but dies, along with his troops, in a five minute burst of action.This must be the easiest money that Washington has ever earned. He literally sleepwalks, makes faces that seem to mock autistics and stabs /slashes / shoots armies in fewer than the time it took you to read this sentence.The third poorly made action film that I have seen almost back to back, after Jawaan and Gadar 2. It is in the same league, with no story, poor action set pieces and an avenging angel, who needs to take a chill pill.",
    "8": "No No No... wow, we have two great little scenes, one in beginning, one in the middle and the worst showdown ever put to film for the ending./.. I'm a massive fan, EQ1 = 10/10, EQ2 = 9/10... this is just... it built up and built up then sat there at the end thinking what happening did the budget run out? Did they literally couldn't be bothered to stage a final shootout? What the hell... look at EQ1 finale in the warehouse, one of the best put to screen ever... then compare it to this...I'm so disappointed, what a bad year for films, MI7 was average, Meg2 was just slack and lacking any passion and now this... I'm always happy seeing Denz and it's a slow burner they all are but left the theatre thinking... wow what a letdown!",
    "9": "NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS MOVIE. There are no characters, there is no story, there is no action, there are no stakes, there is no moral or message or point. THERE IS NO POINT TO THIS MOVIE.Every character are stiff one dimensional pieces of cardboard. About 60% of this movie is just Denzel sitting around in a town in Italy doing jack becoming seen as \"one of them\". The villains are just some stereotypical mafia guys who are so laughably evil in cruel it's not even fun to hate them.The action in this movie is sooooooooo brief too. Denzel is pretty much never in danger and always just quickly assassinates the villians.And easily the worst part of this movie is the climax, because just when things are seeming to start ramping up, the movie is just over. Basically the big mafia boss comes to the town and threatens everyone because Denzel killed his brother in an earlier scene. So at this point you think there might finally be some big action payoff at the end. Nope. Instead what happens is Denzel just magically teleports to the bad guy's house (which he never knew the location of but whatever) and assasinates every guard one by one and then the boss without any sort of struggle. And that's it. He basically just kills everyone with no struggle. In a good movie, this kind of big bad mafia villian would be made to seem untouchable, and it would be an actual struggle for are hero to get to them and kill them. But in the Equalizer 3 are hero just kills a dozen men with no problem. There is no stakes no struggle no sense of urgency. You have no reason to be invested because at no point do you feel like there is any sort of danger.",
    "10": "Denzel Washington has done it again! The Equalizer 3 has brought pretty good badass moments with every best kills from Denzel himself. Also he knows exactly how to end the story of the Equalizer, based on TV series.The director of Training Day, and The Magnificent Seven: Antoine Fuqua, always did an amazing job with his best and third final installment of the franchise. And his directing skills are quite impressive.No, I have never seen the TV series of the equalizer, but I gotta hand it to you, every best moments from the equalizer one, and two had very good moments with Denzel Washington and this movie was solid good with his best badass moments and his best performance as always. Well done, Denzel and Antoine! Well done indeed.",
    "11": "Great story. Starts strong and stays there. Amazing music propels the mood. We have seen the story before with Clint Eastwood, Stallone, Jackie Chan and others. This is Denzel at his best. You believe his inner turmoil. You feel his struggle: Is he a good man or a bad man? Does the good make up for the bad? There is a weight to killing. It weighs on your soul. Friends that do it for the military say it changes a person. The story is laid out in the commercials. Roberto comes to town and ends up fighting the local mafia. I cannot recommend this movie high enough after the crapfest of Barbie, Oppenheimer, Flash, Blue Beatle. Ugh. See this movie!",
    "12": "Bad people are really like tumors, invading everywhere they think is vulnerable territory. They believe they can freely encroach on rightful places, carving out territories or extorting protection money. We are the good guys; in fact, most people are good. Good people do good deeds, avoid conflicts, but unfortunately, there are always bad people trying to take advantage. They dine without paying, steal cars without remorse, and threaten others for money when they don't like something. Good deeds bring good karma, and one can only wish that good people have guardian angels like Denzel Washington's character by their side.",
    "13": "I thought this was a very good movie. They build a story early with little action but it finishes strong. I would take this over the Marvel materials from the past 3 years. Denzel's character is similar to the past but more economy of motion. I wish Dakota had more screen time. The scenes in Italy were lovely. I doubt we will see another one of these movies. This was an old school action thriller. The formula is pretty tried and true. I'm not sure how films have gotten away from what works. I hope all fans will turn out to see this film. My large theater was only 1/3 full but the weather was perfect on a Thursday early evening.Nice Job Anton, Dakota and Denzel.",
    "14": "Equalizer 1 is one of my most favorite movies of all times. So the bar was already very high for the second part - which was kind of disappointment, but was still not extremely bad. This part, however, is atrocious. I really don't understand all these 10/10 ratings here. Even 7 is overrating for this piece of trash. There is no story and no action, and really, it's an extremely boring movie. If you're really into watching Denzel drinking his tea/coffee, watch the movie, as this is what he's doing in about 50% of the movie. And in rest of most of the movie he's just walking here and there for showing us some scenary. If we skim the movie's real material it will be a total of les than 15 minutes, 5 minutes of which was action. The script was for a short movie I think but they made it into a long movie.",
    "15": "Don't get me wrong the movie was great! Even though Denzel Washington isn't the youngest any more his action scenes are brutal and just awesome to watch.The problem is that the movie has very few action scenes with Denzel and literally 20 minutes after his first real Purge against the bad guys we get to the final showdown, which doesn't feel like one, and then we are left feeling like we are still in the 2nd Act because a lot is still very unclear especially concerning the mafia.To see such a week ending/3rd Act after the amazing ending/3rd Act of the 2nd one is pretty disappointing, however balances the best opening from this trilogy which results in a good but nothing more movie.",
    "16": "All this third and final installment was, the same old story but in a different setting, with much less action, and a pointless walking cane that saw zero action. Washington carries the film and is impressive as always, but the writing was way more formulaic, cheesy, with lots of plot holes and ridiculous sub plots riddled with cliches. To make matters worse, Fuqua's choice to have the film set in beautiful Italy failed when most of the film needed English subtitles that took away from appreciating the Italian settings and landscapes, and the subtitles weren't on the screen long enough (not everyone is a speed reader) to make out what dialogue was being spoken in Italian. Technically, this was an Italian film with maybe 10% spoken English, and spending so much time reading subtitles took away from the entertainment value. Nevertheless, Denzel did what Denzel does and did it very well, and is the only reason to see this film.",
    "17": "I saw The Equalizer 3, starring Denzel Washington-The Magnificent Seven_2016, Man on Fire; Dakota Fanning-Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Man on Fire; Remo Girone-My Name is Vendetta, Ford v Ferrari and Andrea Scarduzio-Mission: Impossible_Dead Reckoning Part One, Dark Crossing.This is the third-and supposedly, final-entry in the saga of Robert McCall, the retired government assassin that helps people in need when they have no other options. By the way, all three movies are based on the 1985 tv series starring Edward Woodward, not the current Queen Latifah one. The first movie was in 2014 and the second was in 2018, all starring Denzel as Robert McCall. This one starts with Denzel at a farmhouse in southern Italy. He is retrieving a set of keys from some very bad guys. FYI: You learn later what the keys are for. Just as Denzel is thinking that he can settle down in a small Italian town, he learns that his actions have set off a series of events with some other very bad guys, called the Mafia. Andrea is their local representative and he is not a happy camper. Remo plays the local doctor that helps Denzel when he gets into some trouble and Dakota is the C. I. A. Agent that gets involved in Denzel's wake.It's rated R for strong bloody violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.If you liked the previous movies, you should enjoy this one, too. I did and I would buy it on Blu_Ray.",
    "18": "I was surprised that there was going to be a 3rd installment to The Equalizer, Denzel Washington reprises his role as Robert McCall, a likable friendly guy with a mysterious past, and does not want to fight, but if push comes to shove, he will.I really enjoyed the Italy setting, giving a different setting to put McCall in. Denzel's performance, has McCall, feeling his age and mortality catching up with him. Dakota Fanning is also great has an agent, and her scenes with Washington are a highlight, they both where in Man on Fire (2004), you see the awesome chemistry with them. Bad guys are pretty good to watch. I Better warn you it things up a bit since the last two, but I still enjoyed it, a good ending to a series.",
    "19": "I had no real expectations, good or not, regarding this 3rd installment of the Equalizer series. I like Denzel Washington movies so I was simply happy to see him again on the big screen. E1 & 2 were really enjoyable to watch. E3 left me thinking I'd like to see #4, but then at the end of the movie, I thought it'd be fine to not see another one. E3, imo, was so good I could leave it here. As one reviewer posted, \"Denzel is so damn cool\"...yep, there's no doubt about that. While E3 is different from the other 2, it is well-written, kept me guessing and as usual Denzel doesn't \"act\", he \"is\". What's next for Mr. Washington? Dunno, but I hope he doesn't wait years to bring it to the big screen again.",
    "20": "The film was terrible. To record my criticism, I wrote down my problems in bullet points.No character development at allWhat do some people find emotional about this film? A man drinking tea in a village and celebrating at the end? It was all fake and superficialFar too many silent scenesIs the protagonist a sadist? He lets the boss die for ages and preys on the corpsesAt the beginning the evil one runs around and sees his dead men, at the end the evil one runs through the area and sees his dead menThe bad guys want to build a casino and make some good people ouch.üò¢ You don't hate them at all. Has the leader shown any strength other than bossing around?What did the woman in the story do other than let the case be explained to her?What was the bomb about? Kill the woman? The bad guys probably aren't very good at their jobs.Does anyone even want to kill him? All adults with guns don't shoot, but a child pulls the trigger.the person who has been shot is simply helped and no one asks questions?Why is there a scene where they're just driving from the grocery store to the hotel for a minute and dark music is playing.Is riding a motorcycle so scary?He takes off watch, kills, puts on watch, kills. I don't think the clock ever appears except at the beginning.The film consists of introducing villains, killing them, confronting the boss who runs away because the old doctor has a gun and killing the boss. And then everyone is good and happy. Even the scene where the pensioners get their money seems staged.The film looks like an action short film has been stretched to almost 2 hours. Oh well. After all, other people really like the film üòÇ As we all know, tastes differ. Hahaha.",
    "21": "Most of the characters had no relevance to the story and easily could have left out with zero impact to the plot.It doesn't even have that much action with most of the bodies being shown as here are some people that were killed in a previous scene which took place off camera. Very disappointed.The love story was very weak and he seemed out of place.The bad guys were poorly setup and didn't even appear that dangerous or scary.All in all, it was a very disappointing experience that I regretted taking part in and wish that I had spent my time watching something else. I think even Barbie had more action than this.",
    "22": "I was really enjoying \"The Equalizer 3\" until the last half hour or so. The movie takes it time developing the story but after a while it doesn't know where to go with it. It's a fun ride most of the way but it wraps things up in a rather unsatisfying way. It's a great looking movie with terrific location photography and Denzel Washington does a nice job but the script lets him down. I've seen all three Equalizer movies, including this one, in the theater (today I was at AMC Raceway 10, Westbury, NY). I enjoyed the first two but I haven't seen them since and I don't remember anything about them. Today I enjoyed most of \"The Equalizer 3\" but I have the feeling that when I go to work on Monday, I won't remember much of this one either.",
    "23": "Get ready to read captions for the majority of this film. The best part of this movie is watching Denzel dine at restaurants and the views of Sicily. This is not an action/thriller movie, but rather a Drama/Crime. Dakota's part in the movie made the plot even worse with her being an analysts to a CIA agent to crack the Italian mob.The first hour of this movie is just watching Denzel\nGet accustomed with the towns people. It should only take 10 minutes to visualize a community. You have to wait until the last 10 minutes of the movie to see the person behind the operation. Overall slow burner and poor script.",
    "24": "After ending all crime in Boston and ensuring their flatware all point in the same direction, McCall is in Italy in a house full of dead people doing what he does best. He is there because they took something that didn't belong to them, something we discover toward the end. He did let a young boy live after he killed his family. For some reason, McCall couldn't see the gunshot to the back coming. He ends up injured in a small Sicilian town being tended to by a local doctor. He phones his mess into the CIA (Dakota Fanning) who have determined he is a person of interest and not just an interesting person. The small town adopts McCall as one of their own as he discovers the Mafia is hurting the town. We all know where this ends. Spoiler: No one dies that has to be brought back to life in a future sequel.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Lots of subtitles.",
    "25": "This is the worst film in the trilogy. The best part of this film is that it takes place on the beautiful Almalfi Coast. The music was also decent but otherwise this film was a bore. The action is limited to about 3 sequences. The opening action sequence which is shown in the trailers is the best one out of all of them.The villains are the most clich√© villains ever that don't ever truly feel like a threat. All of the characters were very weak and unmemorable.The story was just uninteresting which made things worse since there was hardly any action.This is a very disappointing ending to this trilogy. Don't waste your time.",
    "26": "This film has Denzel Washington reuniting with Dakota Fanning after having worked together nearly 20 years ago in Man on Fire, they had chemistry back then and it's nice to see them as scene partners again. The Equalizer 3 is the final part of the trilogy and is once again directed by Antoine Fuqua who produced it alongside a handful of others, including Denzel Washington.Robert McCall finds himself at home in Southern Italy but he discovers his friends are under the control of local crime bosses. As events turn deadly, McCall knows what he has to do: become his friends' protector by taking on the mafia.\"Are you good or bad?\" a question McCall can't answer which is a good thing. The thing is, he's as grey as you can be. Feeling no empathy for the people in organized crime he brutally kills, whilst feeling empathy for others who are kind. Throughout these three movies we have seen him do some truly horrific things to other human beings, yet we're still voting for him, and you clearly see he has lost all hope in the beginning when he gets shot by that kid and decides to put the pistol against his temple and pull the trigger, thinking he had bullets left. That's a strong scene and what comes after that? Him turning his life around with three characters which inspires him and improves him as a person; Remo Girone as Enzo Arisio, Gio Bonucci and Gaia Scodellaro as Aminah. The first two were the stand outs for me, great performances! Another performance worth talking about is of course Dakota Fanning as Emma Collins, the reveal at the end with her actually being the daughter of Robert's late handler Susan Plummer which was a nice way of closing the chapter of McCall's life along with his new life in Altamonte.The Equalizer 3, what are my thoughts on it? The conclusion of a trilogy which I've loved since the first film, yet never met the same quality as the first Equalizer film. At its best, it comes close to that same quality. The action is where my expectations are high and if you watch it, you'll probably find yourself in my shoes, satisfied. With Denzel Washington headlining the film and Antoine Fuqua in the director chair, this duo is incredible and as great as ever in this film. Fuqua knows how to direct action, also thriller with realism. I just love the partnership they have, also the one he shares with Robert Richardson, the cinematographer, which is their second cooperation. Editor, Conrad Buff, is another person who has collaborated on multiple projects. The pacing is great and overall, the editing is spectacular. Honestly, I thought it was a satisfying conclusion and a terrific action thriller. Denzel Washington is as great as ever in the role, giving something new to the role, also the character aging is noticed and I think they handled that nicely. The writing was great, I really liked it. I thought it could have been longer because of how the ending felt a little bit rushed. The mise-en-scene was terrific, each scene was beautifully shot and directed. The tension and suspension was there from beginning to end which is impressive because of how the pacing is, it's quite slow which is the reason why I have liked these films so much. You get to know the characters, see how well written they are, especially Robert McCall. The story was really good, possibly the most emotional one yet. I really liked it being set in Italy, made sense with the Camorra. This was a satisfying conclusion to The Equalizer Trilogy, a great action thriller.",
    "27": "I wanted to give it a 2 star rating but seeing all this great and excellent reviews left me no choice but giving it 1 star.Damn I didn't expect much after the second movie but boy was I wrong. It starts with a bunch of bodies lying around so I was thinking ok maybe they show the action in a flashback afterwards. But well the writers have decided the equalizer is now a \"story\" driven movie and doesn't need action sequences. So of course he gets shot in the back and wakes up in a wonderfull village at the shore in sicilly and a doctor and policemen just fix him without asking questions... ok... He's trying to drink tea and is mocked for it but as he recovers he is getting best friend with the locals. We are 1 hour and 15 minutes in the movie and what happened? Kinda nothin... except some mafia goons harrassing the locals. In the end they try to force in some action but it just doesnt feel rigth. Denzel kills everyone without any kind of trouble he is just in god mode and erradicades everything in sigth. But somehow out of your sigth most of the time. As I said in the beginning I didn't expect much but cmon watching a white wall probably would be more entertaining than this...",
    "28": "If you are expecting this to be better than the other two, don't set yourself up for dissapointment. I know, I know, it certainly should be the best of the 3...after all, it takes place in Italy with the real Italian Mafia...but yet somehow there is much less action than the other 2! There are hardly any fight scenes. There's really only 2 scenes that could be called fight scenes, and the fighting is short and involves little choreography. Basically the type of action that you wish to see when you watch a movie like this is almost entirely absent, the opposite of what it should be. Which is frustrating. And that's not the only frustrating part of the movie. Another frustrating part is its predictability and how everything seems to happen just right for the main character. Speaking of which, another frustrating part is how unrealistic it is when this is happening. Which leads me to another frustrating part, which is the unrealistic portrayal of how a man like him would experience Italy, a place known for being rude to outsiders, and especially racist towards black people...yet somehow he experiences no racism, or even rudeness at all, and gets instantaneously welcomed into a community of people who somehow speak perfect english. It's super weak, lame, and frustrating. Not necessarily a bad film. It's scenic and has good cinematography, so it looks nice. It just has really weak writing and non-existent choreography except for those 2 fleeting scenes that can hardly be called fight scenes at all. The story is just so lacking. It seems this trilogy started strong and only got weaker with each installment, which again, is the opposite of how it should be. And the ending of this final film was very anti-climactic too. The main character basically just took down an entire mafia family like knocking down domino's, without sustaining any injuries, or even taking a punch, because there was no fighting what so ever as he was doing it. And then the movie just ended before there could be any retaliation, or seeing what happened to him after he did it. It's just so lame. I'm so disappointed. I'm giving this a 5 because I'm being generous since it wasn't that bad, but it certainly wasn't a good action movie.",
    "29": "Robert McCall is a former marine and spy who finds himself in Sicily on a mission. Events unfold and he ends up confronting and taking on the Italian Mafia. My first foray into the Equalizer universe, this is one Action flick with your usual fistfights, gunshots, mutilations and explosions. One thing that stands out here is the talk. The slow burn chatterbox style of build-up in a film like this which usually never works is on full display and it sure weighs, slows and drags. The story is a fantasy in the vein of \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" where a bald, overweight oddball accomplishes what the entire Italian police force fails to do and brings the Italian Mafia to its knees and lives to tell the tale. The backdrop of Sicily in its old time vintage grime adds sordid splendor to the sketchy plot and erratic pace. Denzel Washington looked like he was doing a job in this flick and you'll feel like you're going through one seeing this to the end. Watchable and nothing to write home about this is a sleeper of the year.",
    "30": "Something missing from this one - any light or fun or even a glint of excitement. It's like a Christopher Nolan Batman movie but even more dark and miserable, imagine if directed by Darren Aronofsky. The violence is unending and brutal, I'm surprised this took just a 15 rating in UK cinemas. I remember getting some thrills, fun and excitement from the first two Equalisers but didn't take any from this. By the time Denzel takes out the final villain, I felt woe for humanity of this is what's deemed entertainment these days. Maybe I'm getting old but I'll stick with classics like Dirty Harry and Death Wish thanks.",
    "31": "The latest 'Equalizer' is the third installment of the action thriller franchise starring Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, a former CIA agent who uses his skills to help people in need. However, this time, the movie fails to deliver the same level of excitement and suspense as the previous ones. The script is terrible, full of clich√©s, plot holes, and inconsistencies. The plot is unbelievable and unrealistic. The action scenes are over-the-top and lack logic, making the movie more suitable for a cheaper production of B movies. The only saving grace of the movie is Washington's performance, which is still charismatic and convincing, but not enough to save the movie from being a disappointment. Equalizer 3 is a letdown for the fans of the franchise and a waste of time for the viewers who expect a quality action thriller. I give it a 6.25 out of 10.",
    "32": "I'm hoping this is the end as we all know how studios and greed kick in to try and exploit another film out of dead franchise, they already did the woke tv show. I didn't have high hopes for this.However it delivered, the settings were beautiful, it was actually a more fresh idea and didn't feel like the exact same movie with a coat of paint like the taken franchise or others became. It made you care about randoms and that was good.It went really fast which is an excellent sign, the female agent was great, I'm all for women in roles but just get the casting right! They did here.Fight scenes were awesome, the sounds were even better, so much better than the JW style, it's just a great film where you can escape reality.",
    "33": "First time I've walked out of a cinema. The violence should have been given a higher rating, 18+ at least.I've watched (and enjoyed) plenty of violent action movies (e.g. John Wick) but this was gratuitous and unnecessary.Loved the first 2 Equalizer movies, but they've obviously run out of ideas and tried to make up for it with attempted shock value.First scene is just long lingering shots of dead bodies killed in creative ways. It didn't even build tension and it ended predictably. Maybe the director was dating one of the makeup artists and wanted to show off their work?!Waste of time and money.",
    "34": "Unfortunately.....this is not a continuation of the Equalizer series.....it's an excuse for the ending of it! The movie bogs down into a simple story of a small town.....terrorized by the mafia......and Denzel comes to the rescue. Some scenes make no sense.....the movie is 15-20 minutes too short....because the action scenes are too short. Seems instead of killing off a lead character.....they decided to retire the character into a small village situation with idyllic surroundings. That's fine......good for the retired......but not good for those looking for action and adventure.....little of which you get here!",
    "35": "I really enjoyed the first one hour of the movie with nice character developments and story flow, but the second part seems like rushed into finish with no plot twists etc. It could have been a much better movie by putting more depth in the story.

    "36": "Remember equalizer was a good movie and so went to watch this one. The first part was still catching eyes as he needed to fight against a gang, and it is still attracting although he is almost 70! But he was shot by a boy and neeeed to stay in a clam village. However, another gang came over and he needed to protect the place. The street scene where he killed the big boss's brother was unpredictable. The later part of the movie was much straight forward and he killed all the bad guys again, where the reason was just to protect the retirement fund of a street pass-by! And it's amazed that the actress is Dakota, where he was his bodyguard in Man on Fire where she was a kid. Time flies!",
    "37": "Denzel Washington makes it feel like he was born for this role, even elevating a simple movie.The film is primarily straightforward, easy to understand, and doesn't promise an exceptional script, but it does tie the series together well and doesn't diminish the entertainment.Of course, there are clich√©s, whether it's the peaceful town or the mafia, they're all clich√©s, but what stuck in my mind in the end wasn't the clich√©s.One of the simplest reasons I'd give this movie a 7 is the makeup. The makeup for the deceased and the CGI in the explosion scene was unexpectedly good; I genuinely applaud the entire team for this aspect.What I really wished for was a more complex storyline, a story that would grip us more, but I didn't feel too bad about how it ended. Thank you, Denzel, for being here.",
    "38": "Years after the events of the past two movies Robert McCall is living the life in Italy. This is where retired government assassin people go when they get old. At first, I was not a fan of one my favorite tv shows reimagined to an American character. I watched the prior two films before seeing this at an advanced screening. Only Denzel can turn what is essential a B movie action flick into a first rate thriller.This third movie brings humanity to the deadly enforcer and it gives the film a heart. Had there not been any films before this one, it could stand alone as it's own film. There's a very much deadly enforcer in this one who didn't get the memo about McCall so he simply doesn't care because he's just as badass.Action movie lovers will get their money's worth here as well as Denzel Washington fans of his \"thinking\" action hero.",
    "39": "Disappointing, this is worse than Equalizer 2.

    "40": "You could watch this movie just for the scenery and the architecture; both are amazing. It may not be quite as violent as the first two in the series. It may not equal the first, but it surpasses the second.I don't think the Dakota Fanning character is fleshed out enough, and the Federal Government NEVER moves this fast. It's she's so underutilized.The remaining support characters were all played so very well. The villagers represented a real idyllic community in Sicily.There's not a lot fault with the movie. There's probably too many subtitles.Denzel Washington is as always tremendous.",
    "41": "The Equalizer movies are just awesome. Denzel has a strong one dimensional character that despite overwhelming coolness and always 1 inch from violence manage to also have empathy and warm heart for the weak. Denzel is genius at this.This third story was a bit confusing at the beginning, in Italy, why?But from there it turns in to a warm and extremely cinematic movie, the violence is absolutely more sparse in this one. But for me it did not matter. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to the end as it was entertaining and thrilling.If you would like more Denzel Washington I can recommend \"Fallen\" it is my all time favorite movie.",
    "42": "\"The Equalizer 3\" is a good action film that moves away from the falsehood of many films of this genre that have been released during the last two decades, in which characters perform physically impossible acts, scenes with flying cars and illogical decisions of its characters who remain unscathed in any implausible situation. In \"The Equalizer 3\" the action scenes are taken realistically and are not exaggerated in their execution, in addition to giving explicit gore scenes done in the old school style. A great success of the film is its cinematography, which is perfectly done and results in a visual delight in camera movements and lighting work, in addition to exploiting the beautiful filming locations. The script tells a story that is not so original but that manages to connect with the viewer. The performances are good, with the always incredible Denzel Washington standing out. A film with a story that is not so original but that manages to stand out and whose production is a first-rate job.",
    "43": "So don't for a moment think that because Denzel Washington is getting older and that he is somehow loosing his touch, you would be sorely mistaken -- and the same can be said about the director. Antoine Fuqua, for they both have struck gold with this, the final installment of their spellbinding and riveting series based upon the television series in the mid-eighties of the same name. And, without giving anything away, you will learn Robert McCall connects back with some of his past adventures from their previous movies, and does so in ways that reflect the lead characters unwavering principles and make him even that much more a doer of good.Bravo.",
    "44": "A film made for an American audience that knows nothing about Italy.A far-fetched plot set in a fake country that is supposed to represent Italy and caricatures of characters that have nothing realistic. Almost 2 hours of platitudes and clich√©s that ruined the memory of a good movie that was Equalizer 1. Too bad. And a pity for a great actor like Denzel Washington, forced to play the worn and sad roles of a once vigorous character. The scene of the bad guy who had let the police chief enter his villa and cut off his hand and then was afraid to be photographed in the square and therefore did not shoot the protagonist was ridiculous.",
    "45": "It all started with the TV show starring Edward Woodward, then came the movie adaptation, which was alright, the sequel was pretty much the same standard, this third instalment was supposedly the conclusion to the trilogy, directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Olympus Has Fallen, The Magnificent Seven). Basically, after arriving at a secluded winery in Sicily, criminal Lorenzo Vitale (Bruno Bilotta) slowly makes his way through the building, where he finds several henchmen have been brutally killed. When he finally enters the basement, he finds former Marine and Defense Intelligence Agency spy Robert McCall (Denzel Washington), being held at gunpoint by two of Vitale's bodyguards. McCall gives him the chance to leave alive, but Vitale tries to kill him, so McCall kills him and the rest of the gangsters. After walking out, he obtains a key to a vault at the winery and takes a bag full of stolen money from a cyber heist. While walking out into the courtyard, McCall is shot in the back by Vitale's adolescent Grandson (Adriano Sabrie). McCall considers suicide due to his injury but changes his mind and takes a ferry to the mainland. While driving on the Amalfi Coast, he pulls over, unconscious from shock, and is found and rescued by local carabiniere Gio Bonucci (Eugenio Mastrandrea). Bonucci brings him the remote coastal Italian town of Altamonte, where he is treated by small-town doctor Enzo Arisio (Remo Girone). McCall makes a slow recovery, walking with a cane and struggling to use the stairs. He forms friendships with the locals, including waitress Aminah (Gaia Scodellaro), and becomes fond of the town and its people. McCall makes an anonymous phone call to CIA officer Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning) to tip her off about the illegal drug trade disguised as business transaction that was taking place at the winery in Sicily. McCall's suspicions are confirmed when Collins and other CIA operatives find millions in cash along with bags of Captagon tablets hidden in a storeroom. McCall recognises he is being tracked when Collins appears, but he does not give clear answers when asked about his identity. Meanwhile, members of the Italian Mafia-type criminal organisation the Camorra harass and kill villagers trying to coerce them out of their houses and take over Altamonte for commercialisation purposes. McCall overhears high-ranking Camorra member Marco Quaranta (Andrea Dodero) pressuring local seafood storeowner Angelo (Daniele Perrone) to pay money he owes. As punishment and warning, Angelo's fish store is firebombed by the Camorra with the entire town helplessly watching. Bonucci watches a video of the firebombing and with Italian central police tries to track a van involved. Bonucci, his wife Chiara (Sonia Ben Ammar) and his daughter Gabriella (Dea Lanzaro) are attacked by the Camorra and beaten for interfering in their operations. Later, Marco and other gangsters demand that Bonucci set up a boat for them. McCall overhears this and requests them to move their operations to a different location. When Marco refuses, he kills him and his henchmen. The Naples head of police is threatened and tortured by Marco's brother Vincent (Andrea Scarduzio) to find who killed him. Collins' car rigged with a bomb by Vincent, but she escapes after McCall warns her. Vincent later threatens to shoot Bonucci in front of the entire town if McCall doesn't reveal himself. McCall walks out from the shadows, but before Vincent can kill him, the several of the townspeople record the ordeal on their camera phones. Vincent and the rest of the Camorra retreat but plan to return the following day. Later that night, McCall kills Vincent and his many bodyguards. The stolen money is returned to an elderly couple, their pension fund, by Collins on behalf of McCall. Back in Langley, Virginia, Collins receives a promotion for her role in ending the Altamonte drug trade. It is revealed she is the daughter of McCall's late handler Susan Plummer and her husband Brian. With the Quaranta brothers dead and all threats to the town eliminated, McCall is finally able to relax and celebrates a football tournament victory with the townspeople. Also starring David Denman as Frank Conroy, Salvatore Ruocco as Vincent's Man, and Alessandro Pess as Viking. Washington is well cast as the retired skilled agent and silently aggressive good Samaritan, and it is good to see him reunited with Man on Fire co-star Fanning, now grown-up and being reasonable as the CIA agent keeping tabs on him. It is the same basic formula; the lead anti-hero observes nasty men doing things to the innocent friends he has made and uses his \"particular set of skills\" to get rid of them, the fights and violence are good, otherwise it is just a standard slick enough action thriller. Worth watching!",
    "46": "The Equalizer 3 is a well made film, good from start to finish, unlike most sequels.Denzel excellent as always, think this is the only film of the series to have another semi-lead character as well, with actress Dakota Fanning. I like the location and feel of this one, it's well directed. I do question what it is that he's doing there all day and night though, all we see is him drinking tea in the cafe. This one contains no sappy person for him to save thankfully and has the appropriate violence. The people of this small town help him and welcome him among them and he's happy to return the favour.",
    "47": "\"What happens here, happens in many towns. The mafia. They're like cancer. No cure.\", says Doctor Enzo Arisio who just saved Robert McCall's (Denzel Washington) life.During his recovery, \"Roberto\" realizes that, thanks to the kindness of the community, he belongs in this wonderful little town in southern Italy.An opinion which is not shared only by the Camorra which imposes crime, violence and terror on what only asks to be a little paradise on Earth.When these abominable criminals attack residents and honest local law enforcement, they wake up \"Roberto\", whose only desire was to continue his convalescence in a healthy and peaceful environment.Once the fate of the low-level criminals is sealed, the mafia criminal organization extends its tentacles to Rome and even attacks the CIA. When the Italian Police Chief and the Central Intelligence Agency agent Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning) fall victim to terrorist acts perpetrated by the Camorra, and their local leader takes the population of \"Roberto's\" adopted town hostage, McCall emerges from darkness to accomplish his mission to restore justice.So that the rule of law, and respect for everyone, regain the place that must be theirs. Thus, proving that there is a cure for cancer, provided that all cancer cells are eliminated before they destroy the body they gangrene.The two final scenes, both in Boston and in the small town on the Amalfi Coast where \"Roberto\" retires, are particularly touching. Like everything that the production team and the cast wanted to infuse into this masterpiece which closes 'The Equalizer trilogy'.",

That has been happening with pretty much all movies this year as it has fallen into some... generic... nameless feeling I can't describe it.But great action, great acting, it just falls off a bit because it feels diffrent. Honestly, they could make 20 more of these movies and I doubt any one of them would be bad. Denzel has a 4th great movie now, he is a great actor!Dakota Fanning, though. Certainly not bad, and despite how amazing Man on Fire was, who wants a second one? Even if there are like 6 books? (which I've never red). Anyway, solid movie, watch it!",

Unlike the first installment wherein you knew Robert McCall had a dark secret but we needed it to unfold due to the circumstances in this one we know and relish his capabilities. Here he is in Sicily for an extended time due to an unfortunate incident and it becomes his new home. He ends up on a collision course with the Mafia and it does not node well for one of them. The violence, the action, the acting, the cinematography on this one are all top notch. Great Flick. Better than Number 2, which was very good.",

Naturally, his quiet time does not last long as some local Mafia types make life miserable for the townfolks. He sees the shakedowns and the violence only gets worse during his stay.Instead of his planned departure, Denzel decides to stay and make things right.The scenery is spectacular, especially the inside of a one thousand year-old church.One of my favorite movie of 2023.",
    "52": "The ending of this trilogy is all about McCall and his desire to find peace and a home. It probably wouldn't even make sense at this (st)age to let him fight every goddamn Mafioso in Sicily.Yes, it's a bit underwhelming in case of fight scenes as e.g. The scenery starts with lots and lots of dead bodies and you don't really know why and wonder how it all started, but Fuqua wants to put Denzel aka McCall in the spot: his heart, his characteristics, his wisdom, but also the heaviness of his heart because of his transgressions.That's it, that's the film you get, a character study in a action trilogy that even though it feels a bit too shiny (for Fuqua typical unfortunately), it definitely has the heart in the right place. And I appreciate that a lot from a flick, where everyone expects only action and violence.",
    "53": "This is a very forced sequel made just to grab some more cash from the audience. The actions scenes are on a tv show level and the plot is predictable. It looks cheap and undeveloped. The overall quality is belowe \"streaming service premiere\" quality. Even regarding cinematography - it's grainy, it's shaky, it's random. The cast sleepwalks through the whole movie.

When you say justice, the subject and actor of the movie, Denzel Washington, immediately comes to mind. Still, it's okay, it's watchable, it's not a very boring and low-level movie. Maybe logically it could have been a better movie. Only the operation to eliminate the mafia and save the town was good.

For a prequel, Denzel Washington is too old. The formula of a vigilante bringing justice to people is not new, but the shooting in Southern Italy is magnificent. The plot is nice, showing a receptive population that welcome Robert McCall and makes him feel good. The plot of the international drug traffic gives the chance to see Dakota Fanning, now a young woman, in the role of a CIA agent that Robert tips off and uses his advices. The plot with the Mafia (Camorra) is very well resolved by Robert McCall in the end. Great to see Vincent having an OD with his drugs. That should be the fate of drug dealers in every civilized country. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"O Protetor: Cap√≠tulo Final\" (\"The Protector: Final Chapter\")",

    "58": "This is a movie that just feels like they were painting by the numbers. If you enjoy the cookie cutter action flick, it's not bad. The template is a western. A solitary man (with some affliction) shows his ability of force. He come to a town that is suffering under corruption. He is pushed to the limits until he fights back for the townspeople.Yep. It's that basic. Again, if this template plays to your heart, this is worth a watch.I would also say, seeing Dakota Fanning, previous of \"Man On Fire\" with Denzel was a bit jarring. That might've been the selling point, but she is as believable as a operative as Jason Statham would be as a mild mannered reporter in a cape. It just felt awkward. I would almost assume she studied Jodie Foster in \"Silence Of The Lambs\" Her line deliveries are very strange and her gait doesn't have that feel of a person of authority (people in law enforcement know what that walk looks like; Dakota seems to be attempting it, but comes off as a gazelle moseying).The action doesn't swell to where you want it to go. The original Denzel Equalizer felt so satisfying in doing away with the baddies. This one felt so...bland. Some of the violence is cartoonish. Such as shoving a gun through a guy's skull and firing through it (c'mon). While others feel like just run of the mill items of convenience used to make ugly bloody pulpy messes.The baddie in here is a nod to a town's gentrification. I know Denzel loves being the savior of the underdog, but does the script have to have it be so obvious. His tough guy words seem off these days. He was such a presence in \"Man On Fire\" That flame is gone.I get the link between Dakota and Denzel. It's as if you are a fan of \"Man On Fire\" and you want to know what became of Pita afterwards.Well, she's a spec op who walks funny.All in all, not a bad watch. It does what you want it to do. Nothing more, nothing less.",
    "59": "I think it's heartwarming that Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning worked together on Into the Fire back in the day. Equalizer 3 is quite enjoyable was nice to see in imax, I can't decide which is better though but I'd definitely recommend this amazing action extravaganza! A lot more foreign based which I didn't expect yet Denzel made everything awesome and the acting is phenomenal throughout with more brutal action than than previous films. It's impressive that stylish stunts were done at high age. One of the most notable aspects is the gorgeous visuals throughout and entertainment value is great!",

The Italian Mafia.Being that the film takes place in Italy, it is of course beautiful. The final chapter has a nice story to it too, and caps the trilogy of nicely.The first film is still my favourite, although this one is next in line. Even though these are McCall's easiest foes, they may be the most satisfying deaths. He's more of Michael Myers slasher killer in this one. He's a straight up nightmare for these bad guys.Denzel Washington shows he is still one of the greatest actors of the last 35 years.",

The plot leaves alot to be desired. And it didn't seem like there was much dialogue. And it moves pretty slowly. Lots of \"thinking\" scenes which was sort-of misplaced. But they are heavy on the blood and gore and shoot-em-ups. Definitely a slow-burn type of build-up to get the audience worked up and swayed to Denzel's savior side. Whatever. Yes, scenic views of the quaint little Italian village and cute villagers. But just entirely too much gore and blood for my taste. Disappointed they would put this out as a \"blockbuster\" or whatever. Save your money. Stream it in a few months when it is available.",

It was like one of those bad summer movies where the violence is too much. I love a good action flick but I don't need this level of violence to entertain me! Denzel Washington doesn't need to make this garbage for us to watch anything he in. Sort of reminds me of the Expendables...to many exploding heads for my liking. On a side note, the countryside and Italy was so lovely... it reminds me of my time in Tuscany when I was a child. My mother would buy fresh bread every day from the little bakery in the middle of the block down by our house...a lovely memory.",

He is the sole savior of this film since it is a total trainwreck. Yes Italy lends itself for beautiful scenic shots and the maffia for a good story. But boy oh boy did they make it a good guys/bad guys script filled with nonsense. To name a few plotholes/nonsense: the internet gang hacks the bank account of a pensionfund so the pensioners loose their money. They transfer the money but then change it into cash. The maffia threathens a policeman and mutilates a head of police while corrupt policemen are usually assets that are bribed and blackmailed. On the plaza Robert is confronted with Vincent after killing his brother. But after the confrontation Vincent leaves without Robert (usually would have been pushed in a van and transported away). Robert knocks Vincent unconscious, but still manages him to let him eat his own drugs. How? Robert gives the bag with cash to a CIA operative with only the name of the man to which it belongs. A) how does this women gets the money into the USA without any problems and b) how does she know where to find him? It is all lazy scriptwriting, hopefully Equalizer4 will have an intelligent script that makes sense.",
    "64": "I would say this was an entertaining film. I thought the Gomorrah guys were a little over the top, especially the big boss and his brother, but the movie was scenic and the local Italian towns were great. As usual with Fuqua, the direction seem to be handled well, and the writing wasn't bad. Denzel was great. Fanning was decent, but I felt she was miscast for the role, or perhaps they should have written her character as someone with more field experience. She felt like she was in over her head and did not feel like a feasible character.The one thing that I did object to was the soundtrack, it was one of the worst soundtracks I've heard in the past 10 or 20 years. It felt like it was done by a kid who was trying to be annoying, and there was absolutely no reason for that. Lots of good artists out there who could have created a soundtrack that helped to absorb one into the fail, instead of the opposite effect. Hopefully Marcelo Zarvos does not get any more films to degrade.",
    "65": "After finishing a job, Robert McCall is shot in the back and ends up in a small town near Naples. While recovering, the townspeople help and accept him without question, and he grows to think of it as home. As Robert gets to know the town, he also senses it is in trouble. As the problems in the town escalate, he realizes that there is more going on and enlists the help of a young CIA analyst to tie up all the loose ends.The third installment of the franchise differs from the first two. There is not as much action as in the first two, but the violence is intense. The story leaves you wondering how it fits into the overall storyline. By the end, it all comes to a satisfying ending. It is worth a watch for franchise fans, but it can also be streamed at home.",
    "66": "Robert Mccall (with 2 C's & 2 L's) wants to have a peaceful life in each of the 3 Equalizer movies, but it turns out that he can't. What's better place to settle after retirement than southern Italy. Maccall finds himself end up in Altomonte where he's liked by the locals and he too is enjoying daily cappuccino in the local caf√©. But some elements of the society are making the life of the residents of this small town/village difficult. Maccall is the one who can save this Shangri-la type of place by creating Havocs in the lives of local Mafia and in the process helping CIA (Dakota Fanning) to contain a bigger threat looming over Italy.Scenic views of regions of Campania and Calabria mainly Sicily & Naples are great to watch. Action sequences are just appropriate.In my view, better than the previous part but the first one is still the best.",
    "67": "The begining was kind of slow.. but since it is a Denzel movie it is always enjoyable.. how does he do that? Most movies when there is no action going on, we just sleep or fast forward through the boredom..anyway, the dakota fanning scene with mccall was funny.. every time they have a female character, they always need to assert dominance and say dumb things.. her taking in mccall or trying to intimidate him or whatever she tried to do lol.Im sorry but she is what? She is 29 but looks 20.. nah, she aint got the looks to try to be some CIA badass case agent.. for that, you should have brought Gadot, De Armas or maybe Johansson.. or Scarlett would have been awesome at this..ok, the last paragraph I was writing while watching the movie so at the end we understand why he was doing this.. she is a rookie and he pretty much feeds her all the info he himself finds because she had no actual intel nor the experience to come up with all those leads and deductions.. but you see.. that is the thing, without McCall to guide her, she would be easily become a one hit wonder..right? She breaks some crazy drug smuggling thing thanks 100% due to Roberto and then she wouldnt be able to do anything close to it later on.. but ok, details, right?And like another reviewer said.. the villains were ridiculous.. \"Teddy\" from movie 1 was much more menacing and presented a better challenge.. here, you have some punks terrorizing the city for half of the movie and when robert gets better, the dudes are gone next scene LOL..even the super bad guy.. he goes to the city, makes a scene.. next sequence, every one of his guys are gone and then he receives some nice OD to see how it is like to die by one..so, I would say the point of the movie was to make him find a place where he belonged and wanted to be there.. let us ignore the fact he aint probably got a visa.. and better yet, no job.. but infinite money for tea every day in the morning at the local caff√©it doesnt matter.. it was just a fitting end starting with him helping someone he barely knew, helping the people he began to care about and also helping someone related to someone he really liked in the past.Well done.",
    "68": "They should call this Robert McCall One Man Army LOL. Nothing ever fazes him and he is cool, calm, and collected but deep down at least he has a soul. Not all mercenaries or PI's would having such a soul.But in all seriousness, he finds a place in Italy and finds his place. It seems the violent past comes back to haunt him though he wants to so desperately leave that behind. Still he can't help but be involved.Italian mafia bullies people who are poor and less fortunate and even the police can do nothing about it. Going so far as nearly having a police friend of McCall's getting badly beaten up and nearly killed.So McCall uses his brand of justice to finally end the mafia and find peace once and for all.Nice to see a Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington reunion. She was just a kid when they first teamed up. Still the ending will surprise you about her character!",
    "69": "It is like they made a movie whilst on holiday in Italy. It feels so far removed from the previous two movies I had to check who directed, Antoine Fuqua must have been on Syrian synthetic meth to deliver this. It felt so low budget, like a spaghetti western about gangsters. I'm assuming the wriyers strike caused problems as that would explain why we had 2 action scenes where Robert McCall takes out the baddie villa twice in a movie. The first time its shot without action, just a long tracking shot of carnage through the villa where McCall is revealed to have killed almost everyone but then surrenders so the big boss comes into the room..... so he can then kill him.... cos timing it so the big boss is there was too difficult presumably?Im really dissapointed. The worst part was that the supporting cast were so dreadful. It was nice to see Creasey and Pita back together even if they did shoehorn the big reveal of who her parents were, da da daaaaaa!It's a shame the Equalizer trilogy ends on such a weakened movie.",
    "70": "\"Equalizer 3\" brings the trilogy to a close with the series' signature style intact. Denzel Washington once again delivers an efficient and entertaining performance as Robert McCall, the vigilante with a heart of gold.The film serves as a compelling swan song for McCall, as he takes on his most personal mission yet. The action sequences are brutal and intense, showcasing McCall's ruthless skills and providing a satisfying dose of catharsis for the audience.However, \"Equalizer 3\" does have its moments of weakness. Some parts of the plot can feel dragging, which occasionally slows down the pacing.Overall, \"Equalizer 3\" delivers on its promise of action and suspense, wrapping up the trilogy with style. It's a fitting conclusion for fans of the series.",
    "71": "Equalizer 3 (E3) delivers in a big way. The third installment of this film was more realistic and had a better ending than the second film and slightly less impressive than the first Equalizer. E3 differs from the first two films with it's European setting, possesses a strong storyline with a good amount of bloody action. Dakota Fanning plays a moderate role that made me reflect back to the film \"Man on Fire\" when her and Denzel paired together in another action packed film. I thought E3 was a solid film that delivered. The film's action sequences were gruesome and gory, but not too unrealistic. The plot was simple, but appropriate and Denzel's portrayal of Robert McCall was charming, fierce, and moral. The film hits the mark, especially since it's difficult to make a third film that isn't substantially worse than the first two.",
    "72": "I didn't watch the first 2 movies in full. Similar to some of the other reviews, I felt the third one lacked some action. We knew very well the final boss, Vincent, stood no chance against Robert, not to mention they know nothing about Robert. But then as the final scene rolls out, I realized this is the ending of Robert's story. He was always avenging for others, but this time he can protect them. He also found a place he calls home. The purpose and meaning of the music and cinematics throughout the movie now make sense to me, and I finally can properly appreciate the movie for what it is: a retirement tribute to Robert McCall.",
    "73": "Denzel does this like only Denzel can. He's getting a bit long in the tooth but it was a pretty solid entertaining movie. I wish this series started earlier so there would be more sequels as I do still like watching Denzel do his thing. Personally, I thought things tied together reasonably well (need to stay to the end to see it). The Italian locale offered some pre-conceived notions that may cloud our views and/or opinions but I don't think it got into the way at all. Everyone else has offered up their views on the action so I won't duplicate. Just know that if you're a Denzel fan and/or a fan of the Equalizer series, you will enjoy this one, and maybe you'll hope there's one more, like I hope.",
    "74": "Very good movie. The construction of the plot and the feeling of tension grows until an ending that has it all. It must be recognized that one of the keys to the film is to take us to a different place (the first two were in the US) and that place was magnificently filmed, generating visual delight. The casting, cinematography, cinematography and direction were top notch. A couple of details should be noted: the first is the loose end of the first sequence that one hoped would be resolved; The second is the lack of realism in the representation of crime (exaggerated) and the police (ineffective, corrupt) that does not go hand in hand with the reality of present-day Italy. Despite this, it is an enjoyable experience and represents his ideal role for the main actor. It is a film that has rhythm but honors great masters like Peckimpah where the violence can be fierce but does not necessarily take up all the footage. Recommended.",
    "75": "Denzel Washington (rogue agent) goes to Sicily (Italy) to combat the Italian mob. And he wacks them all. The end.The bad: too little action, too much Sicilian scenery. Only about 5 figthing scenes, that's a bit meager. Sicily does look beautiful, but isnt this suppose to be another Equalizer edition (the final one) and doesnt every Equalizer movie has to have A LOT of thrilling fighting scenes? Bit disappointing to be honest.More bad: the (supposedly vicious) mob boss isnt impressive at all. So arent the other mobster guys. They look kinda silly and are way too easily killed by Denzel. No real thrill in that.Even more bad: Dakota Fanning is miscast as a (supposedly) tough cia agent. She looks too cute for that.Conclusion: Lacking in thrill, lacking in action, lacking in mean bad guys.Not any good?It's not all bad though. Denzel Washington is still COOL, CALM and COLLECTED, the way I like to see him, but it's too much looking like Denzel was on holiday on Sicily, instead of being a thrilling gangster movie.Ah well, despite the slowburning \"holiday\" look and feel of this last edition, it is still an enjoyable watch...but the first edition is definitely better, although the second edition is definitely worse, way worse than this one....",
    "76": "The Equalizer 3 is a solid concluding chapter to this entertaining trilogy. Even with an entirely new setting and cast, it does a great job of setting everything up and making you care about his new relationships. The movie overall is entertaining and mostly satisfying.As usual, Denzel is a beast. Charm and charisma are off the charts, this isn't news. Like with part 2, there are few looks he gives that chill me to the bone. It's so impressive the way he portrays being the nicest guy in one scene and the scariest guy in another.The only thing holding this back from being great is the surprising lack of action. Now I wouldn't call either of the previous movies action-packed. But I would estimate this one has a total of about 7 minutes of action. That's just not enough. And it especially hurts during the not-so-climactic climax.I still had a good time with this movie. If you like the series, I think you will be pleased. And to Hollywood: more Denzel please! (1 viewing, opening Friday UltraScreen 9/1/2023)",
    "77": "This is a decent and satisfying end to a trilogy. Remember the good ol' days, back in the day, when movies stopped at 3? No Fast X, Saw X, Indiana Jones cracking a whip at 85.Things feel more complete at three.The way things should be.A beginning, a middle and an end.And not some old man doing ridiculous things way beyond his age or physical capability.Denzel is one of the greats.And he deserves credit for never taking a role too far.He's as much a presence on the screen here as he ever has been.His age and wisdom is his real strength.Oh, there will be punches thrown. Bones broken and many cries of agony.But at least it comes from the villains on screen and not those in the audience.Coastal Italy is gorgeous.Denzel is a living legend.You've seen the other two films in this series.Wrap it up nicely with this installment.Ciao.",
    "78": "My expectations for this one were moderate, I enjoyed the first, I wasn't blown away by the second, this third and final movie is actually really good.It's a pretty good storyline, with Robert of course central to events and fighting for justice. He takes on Italian gang bosses, and of course there are multiple fight and action sequences, but in this film, he felt mortal, in the second I felt they made him into some sort of superhero, you felt he was indestructible, I didn't get that here.The action sequences are great, and it is very, very well produced, but the true winner here is The Italian scenery, it looks sublime, and arguably enhances the movie.Washington, outstanding once again, he really does nail it. This film has prompted me to get a hold of the original Edward Woodward series, that's up next.Entertaining.7/10.",
    "79": "The Equalizer 3 rounds out this unexpected trilogy with another satisfying action thriller that continues the journey of a man who understands violence, trying to finally put that behind him, placing him out of his element to show quite literally how far he goes for people. The ending hinders it a little because it feels anticlimactic but it still works.On a quest to finally find and maintain happiness, Denzel Washington is as flawless as ever. This time around he gets to be happy and show McCall actually enjoying life for once and as this is the final instalment there's obviously some introspection and self reflection as well.The villains are really weak, it's not a massive distraction as they remain easy to hate and don't take up too much time but as the marketing implied that this would be McCall meeting his equal is kinda laughable considering how little they feel like a genuine threat to him.The subplot involving Dakota Fanning initially threatens to derail the film but thankfully it ties back into the main narrative effectively and any scene she shares with Washington is great because it's both a Man on Fire reunion and her rapport with Washington is so good.Antione Fuqua's direction impresses yet again, the violence has never been faster or more brutal and the stark colour palette allows this one to stand out in contrast to its predecessors. The music by Marcelo Zarvos is better than it's ever been, so distinct and noticeably industrial.",
    "80": "In 2014, director Antoine Fuqua released The Equalizer, a film based on the television series of the same name that aired from 1985 to 1989. Where actor Edward Woodward played the role of Robert McCall in the series, none other than Denzel Washington was chosen for this film, who of course already had a whole arsenal of this kind of action films to his name in the past. What is funny is that in this third part of The Equalizer he is reunited with Dakota Fanning. The two already starred together in the 2004 film Man on Fire, but Fanning was only a ten-year-old girl there. In this film, she plays a CIA agent who tracks down McCall after an anonymous phone call to her agency leads her to a very large drug discovery on a wine farm. After a very strong first part, a fairly mediocre second part of The Equalizer followed in 2018. Now, five years later, you hold your breath a bit whether this third part is going to be worth it, of course. Well, that sounds quite negative compared to the second part, but it was just where the first part excelled, the second part had simply become more of a standard action print. Certainly not a bad film, but just less than its predecessor.In this film, the story moves to Italy, Sicily to be precise. McCall ends up badly injured in Sicily, where he is rescued by the local agent Gio Bonucci, who takes him to the local doctor Enzo Arisio. McCall comes to and befriends the locals. The village is only ravaged by the mafia and of course McCall won't let that happen just like that. The film takes a long time to explain everything. It all starts on the wine farm, where McCall is on the trail of serious criminals and also murders them. The action scenes leave little to the imagination and are sometimes just rancidly portrayed. After that, the film slows down considerably and takes a good look at McCall's recovery and how he befriends the local population. When he leaves an anonymous tip to CIA agent Emma Collins, it is of course a simple calculation that she will quickly track McCall. Meanwhile, McCall watches with sorrow how the local population is put under heavy pressure by the mafia. Of course you immediately understand that they shouldn't have messed with McCall.Most of the film seems like a long advertising film for Italy and it may evoke the holiday feeling in many viewers. The images are absolutely beautiful and eye-catching, something that enhances the atmosphere of the film. Still, a point of criticism can be made with the bad guys from the story, because we can't really say that they really express a lot of threat so that McCall faces a real challenge. But also the character of CIA agent Emma Collins has no added value in the film. You will therefore often wonder why she has so much screen time in the film. Not that it's really annoying or anything, but it doesn't really add value. Perhaps because this is the only film of the three that is under two hours, this storyline may have been intended as filler to keep the film from being too short. It now feels a bit like a wander in the story where the writers didn't really know where they wanted to go. The ending is what you can really expect from it and is of course accompanied by a lot of violence, but this so-called final chapter does not become as good as the first part.The Equalizer 3 may not be as good as the very strong first part, but it certainly beats the disappointing second part in every way. Denzel Washington returns for the third and, according to the subtitle, the last time as the ice-cold and tough retired commando who carried out so-called 'black operations' for the government. This time the story moves to the beautiful Sicily in Italy, where Robert McCall gets into trouble with the mafia this time. The role of Dakota Fanning is very superfluous and really adds nothing to the film at all, the mafia members don't really radiate a lot of threat, so as a viewer you know that McCall will not be faced with his toughest job. Still, the action is nice in the film and it also has a pleasant running time that has been kept under two hours. Whether this really will be the final piece in the Equalizer series is of course still the question, but it is clear that this is very pleasant viewing and simply an excellent action film.",
    "81": "I liked Equalizer 1 and 2 but this third entry has a \"might as well make another one\" feel about it. There are some brutal kills but some of them feel very phoney with their CGI blood.The plot is very straight forward and kind of predictable. The mafia villians are pretty dumb. While the random scenes featuring a grown up Dakota Fanning feel tacked on and unnecessary.The other 2 movies built up to a big action finale. Which made for some standout action. The first one in a hardware store, and the second during a hurricane. But this one is just in some guys house.Its unfortunately very straight forward and fotgetable this time, but Denzel Washington has a few bad ass moments. If you want to wait past all the scenes of him tackling high stairs.",
    "82": "Following the disappointingly lackluster sequel that notably marked the first time Denzel ever agreed to a sequel, \"The Equalizer 3\" remarkably surpasses expectations - though admittedly, I had set the bar fairly low. But any reservations were dispelled early on, as the movie plunged straight into its visceral, stylish action that sees Denzel masterfully blending the vibes of John Wick, Liam Neeson's unyielding avenger in \"Taken\", and his own enigmatic survivor from \"The Book of Eli\".Age seems like just a number when it comes to Denzel. As he inches closer to 70, there's no slowing down. The film cleverly incorporates his age into his character, offering action sequences that lean more on intelligent combat rather than sheer brute strength and stamina akin to Rocky or John Wick. There's an elegance in how he maneuvers, outthinking and outmaneuvering adversaries in ways that leave you awestruck.I absolutely loved witnessing the reunion of Denzel and Dakota Fanning, their electric dynamic echoing reminiscently of \"Man On Fire\". Their chemistry is undeniably magnetic, and adds layers of depth to the already charged narrative.One of the movie's masterstrokes is its unyielding focus on the sheer prowess of Denzel's character. He remains ever the cool, unshakeable force of nature, perpetually ten steps ahead of everyone, leaving both foes and audience in anticipation of his next move.While some might dismiss it as yet another action-filled extravaganza, for me, \"The Equalizer 3\" was the epitome of action cinema artistry. A mixture of raw, over-the-top action, the evergreen charm of Denzel, and a touch of Italian style made it the ultimate cinematic cocktail. It's a whirlwind of entertainment, action, and thrill - and I found myself completely immersed and gratified.In short, \"The Equalizer 3\" delivers in spades. For fans of Denzel and the action genre, it's a treat that shouldn't be missed.",
    "83": "I am a huge fan of the first part, the second one was decent, but this one was a huge disappointment. Hard to believe the same star and director were involved in this. The main problem is that this third installment is incredibly slow and lacks action, esp. When compared to the first Equalizer movie.That 80% of the film was in Italian with subtitles did not help.There are only three very short action scenes in this, one at the beginning, one in the middle and one at the end. Nothing about them is exciting or special. Most of the time you see Denzel sitting at a table drinking tea or walking around a nice Italian city. The villains are totally generic and forgettable. The sub-plot with a young female CIA agent is unnecessary.What left me thinking was why was everyone in this Italian city so nice towards Denzel¬¥s character, although they did not know him at all? Why did the doctor help him and did not report him? Why did the policeman help him, why did he not search his car or did any background check?The idea of McCall going against the Italian mafia sounded so cool and promising, but the outcome was disappointing. Maybe Fuqua and Denzel just wanted to have a nice holiday in Italy.",
    "84": "Denzel Washington is undoubtedly one of the best actors of his generation, and he has starred in a wide range of roles including more prestige-oriented films as well as some mid-range action thrillers. This franchise, about a vigilante who will stop at nothing to deliver violent justice on behalf of those who have been wronged. The first two films were moderately entertaining action films largely anchored by Washington's charisma, but this film is a significant step down from the first two in terms of quality. It's even more generic, pointless, and lacking in creativity or soul, which is too bad given just how much I am a fan of Denzel.This film centers around Robert McCall living in southern Italy, having a seemingly idyllic life until that is derailed by Mafia gangsters. The first two films in this series were far from original, but they felt more unique in story than this film, which is completely by-the-numbers. There's never any real tension about the fate of neither McCall nor the vicious gangsters he's trying to stop. The screenplay is also generic and rote; moreso than in the earlier films. There's just so little to take away from the storytelling here besides sporadic, outlandish bursts of R-rated action. McCall's character isn't much further developed, the plot developments aren't unique or clever, and despite being less than two hours, the film feels a bit long. The only unequivocal positive is some beautiful shots of southern Italy.As a result, I do not recommend this film. This doesn't make Denzel Washington any less of an excellent actor, he just simply needs better material than this, as the overwhelming majority of his films are. 4/10.",
    "85": "It's not very often you see a second sequel in a film franchise and it actually turns out to be a very good movie. In fact, most of the time, they end up being some of the worst. Thankfully, this new entry by series director Antoine Fuqua and star Denzel Washington is a fantastic example of how to do a sequel right.I will say the film is not perfect. There are a few storylines that don't quite add up to anything, like Denzel's character having flashbacks of his murders and how bereft and awful it makes him feel. Something thay could have and maybe should have been explored just a bit more. However, that is ok because the film swiftly picks itself up and in the days where most films like this are over 2 hours long, this one keeps it's pace and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Good choice on the writers and directors part.The acting throughout the film ranged from good to fantastic. It seemed everyone was pretty much on point here as far as what their characters needed and how to display that to the audience. It was also lovely to see Dakota Fanning and Denzel Washington back together. I would love to see them work together in other films because they have fantastic on-screen chemistry.Overall, one of the best sequels to a film I've seen in a long time. Although, not an entirely necessary one, but the story and acting is good enough to justify it's existence. Plus, can you really go wrong with Denzel?4 italian mobsters out of 5.",
    "86": "Equalizer 3 well....This movie is a complete bore fest of a film. It is nothing like the other 2 at all.Most of the movie consists of watching denzel on the phone, drinking tea or walking around.Gone are the times you remember from the first movie with him checking his watch for how long it takes him to kill the bad guys. The reason for this is because you don't really see him kill any bad guys (a handful).Denzel character never felt in danger so i dont know why the trailer made it out like he met his equal as i dont recall him getting injured whilst In his new found happy place.So many people at the start of the movie have guns (adults) but yet doesn't get shot until a small child takes aims and fires and nearly kills denzel.All in all set in a nice back drop but honestly if you don't speak Italian or can't read the subtitles then you won't have a clue what's going on as majority of movie is in Italian.Conclusion = boring movie, lazy script, boring bad guys, nothing really ever happens unless you enjoy tea.Was it a good send off? NO NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST.",
    "87": "The movie, Equalizer 3, starts out well. There is a rather good slow action scene to start the movie. But it is all downhill from there.Without ever really establishing a plot or a reason for why the Equalizer is where he is today, the movie does not flow like the other films. There is a mafia connection, but nothing else to really tell us why the Equalizer is doing what he is doing or why he is even still there.Like so many sequels, there is usually either more sex, blood, or violence. For Equalizer 3, it is definitely violence. There are some scenes where you almost have to look away because of how violent they are.It is just an awful story line about mafia, drugs, and possible terrorist ties that did not make sense. Like the film itself, everyone seems to know that Mr. McCall, the Equalizer, is a special person whereas the previous films tended to hide his unique abilities. There is no anonymity to the person or the story anymore.The previous plots were personal in nature while this one is completely impersonal. We get a hint at the end of the movie that there might have been a personal connection, but the story line is so convoluted that I could not figure out what the personal connection was or how it fit.The movie has enough action to get through it. But do not expect the level of story and plot line like you found in the first film or even the second. It simply is not there. Like a lot of sequels, this movie gets away from what made it such a good first movie to begin with.",
    "88": "The equalizer always has a \"you should've...\" scene; 'you should've taken the money, you should've let me in' and they're all great. This installment doesn't hold back on action, while the first two films had the most memorable fights, this one still stands on its own. Plot progresses a little slower but still engaging. It's predictable, but that simplicity works in its favor, with no unnecessary additions which for me was the writers exude confidence in their narrative.This is exactly what you'd expect from an Equalizer film. The protagonist is more humane and compassionate, yet the action maintains its brutality. It's a journey of revenge and finding peace, a fitting end to the trilogy. The pacing is good, having serene moments alongside thrilling fights without changing the vibe of the film. The sudden religious rally confused me though; perhaps I just missed something earlier.It's Denzel Washington being a badass, always a treat to watch for me. Didn't give it a perfect rating. While it didn't blow me away, I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it. A trilogy binge-watch would make for a fun day, and I wish they'd re-release it for a triple feature like they did with Black Panther in cinemas.",
    "89": "\"The Equalizer 3\" is the best in Denzel Washington's film series, embracing an old western formula, specifically \"Shane.\" The \"final chapter\" offers more dramatic heft and equalizing elements. The third installment by Washington, director Antoine Fuqua, and screenwriter Richard Wenk possesses sentimentality, reuniting the star with Dakota Fanning almost 20 years after his death in \"Man on Fire.\" The film follows retired assassin Robert McCall, who helps those in need in Italy, where the Mafia provides ample human cannon fodder to eliminate. \"Equalizer 3\" begins with an R-rated opening sequence. McCall, a wounded gunfighter, is taken to a seaside village where the locals welcome him. He considers hanging up his guns and settling down, but the Mafia plans to take over the town, leaving him with a choice: to intervene or not. The film explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the consequences of one's actions in a dangerous world. The film is a thrilling and thought-provoking exploration of the complexities of human relationships. \"The Equalizer 3\" is a film that explores the fallout from a crime scene and a tip given to a young CIA agent by Robert McCall. The film cleverly weaves together various strands, providing emotional resonance despite the generic threat and big crime boss. The film, which has been released nine years after its first release, has a sequel and a CBS version starring Queen Latifah. Although not entirely convincing as a \"final\" film, it feels like it reaches a point where the story ends on a positive note for Robert McCall and all things equal. The film's emotional resonance is enhanced by the use of quiet strength and the presence of Andrea Scarduzio. The Equalizer 3 is the final destination on a nearly decade-long journey for the filmmaker and his leading man, Matt Washington. McCall, a government assassin, faces injustice and is unable to ignore it. After being rescued by a Good Samaritan, he finds a community under the oppressive and violent fist of local crime bosses, the Sicilian mafia. All hell breaks loose as McCall protects his new friends and their livelihoods. Washington appears more at ease in McCall's skin than ever, despite the internal battle he's going through. His ability to manifest this in both moments of calm (such as his ritualistic setting in a cafe) and moments of violence (such as picking off bad guys in a dark alley) is incredible. The character feels more of a personal stake in his actions, which is interesting as he has always dispensed justice with contained and almost indifferent rage. While not Washington's best work, it's a great performance hanging on the frame of another tight script by Richard Wenk, and it's undoubtedly his best turn in the franchise. The Equalizer 3 is a visceral sequel to Antoine Fuqua's franchise, featuring McCall's simple skillset and Washington's icy delivery. The film showcases Washington's ability to switch from sympathetic to killer, making him a step ahead of his enemies. However, the film's yawn-worthy, bordering-on-troubling context for its baddies prevents it from reaching the rewatchable heights of its predecessors, making it a less enjoyable experience.",
    "90": "Im sorry how can anyone rate this above 1 star? 2 Stars at best!Very disappointing. Some of my gripes:A half decent storyline (looks like Fuqua lost the plot and panicked trying to establish new story arcs/tie up old ones)Was there a villain in this movie? I literally cant remember, such is the ease with which McCall dismantled (and disfigured) the supposed \"mafia\". This one is perhaps the most frustrating disappointment for me, as I was expecting a worthy adversary, whereas the villains in this film are a joke.The trailers make numerous reference to \"The equalizer meets his equal\". Um, where? When? Who?",
    "91": "LIKES:The Music:\n-Simple, but powerful, a track that holds the spirit of the Equalizer with its mighty instruments blaring and loud drums.-It holds so much in the tones and when used together with the powerful scenes and acting unleashed a power shot that makes the theater shake.-The majestic attitude of the pieces are awesome, and the versatility to it is subtle, but works very well for what they accomplished in the movie. Fantastic in just how much it adds.The Cinematography:\n-One of the high points, the movie is solid in how much it captures with the shots they chose.-The filters are perfect to convey the mood, dark and foreboding at times, bright and hopeful in others, and a middle ground that conveys the level of the threat.-It captures so much of the culture of the setting, the feelings of the villains in their savagery, and the moments of dark dread and discovery to really hit hard.-And then you bring the moments of justice, the Equalizer trying to equal and adding that emotion that you love in these movies as the blow is dealt.-Every shadow, very alley, and every finishing moment drips emotion and I love that about this franchise in how it delivers that raw edge.The Sound Editing:\n-Another small trick, another effective treat to help with hitting the high notes and putting another layer of the Equalizer.-The sound engineering is top notch, those awesome bytes brought in at the right moments to emphasize the movie.-Wet sounds of knives, blaring gun noises, and several other things add that realistic horror noise that fans love to hear. And other effects of crashing and destruction ring out to add to the carnage that smashes the ears and brings you into fun.The Acting:\n-Another wonderful addition to the mix, Equalizer's setting welcomes the acting traits of the character and the talents they bring.-Mastandrea holds charm, that moral drive and character to pull the whole movie together in many ways. He's compelling, he's fun, he's sincere and sweet, and works super well with his cast to convey the family feeling.-Fanning is totally great in this role. She's not the most interesting or really intense CIA agent, but for the purpose of the character she works. Her dry delivery works with Denzel's demeanor, making a sort of body cop design of the characters thrive and have that charm I like to lighten up the movie without destroying the tones too much.-And Washington is of course the top tier actor who does so little and yet so much with his performances.-His lines might be monotone and seldom waver from the calm neutral, but the way he adds the inflections, the little pauses, and those hints of surprise help give them light.-While physical acting and mannerisms are a level on themselves giving the Equalizer that other half of the coin that is scary, intense, but good in many ways.-And the chemistry with so many people, touching up moments without straying too far from the character achieves in this series. What a great acting performance.The Story/Emotions\n-Equalizer always has that underlying moral aspect that identifies but sells it in just the right touch of things to add that satisfaction without going into the cheese zone.-And this movie may do it the best in terms of the storytelling. Equalizer is not really the best in terms unique plot lines or surprises, but what it suffers in clich√© succeeds in execution.-This town he dwells in has a lot of charm and heavy character centric morals that are stalwart and the anchor to which we have everything latched on to.-Not enough? Well how about the fact that you get this stellar tie in to the other films and in a way that takes the relationships and fosters them to motivational heights?-Still not enough, well how about the effects of what happens during this movie and elevates Robert to that same level of heroism we love?-That's the feelings that I got watching, and the biggest punch of the movie and what I felt gave reason to go through the dark chaos again and the violence. That's the level of storytelling and use that a writer like me likes and what I hope you will enjoy as well.DISLIKES:Predictable:\n-The plot sort of follows the same song and dance routine, and given the origins it's not expected.-You know who is going to suffer, you know how he is going to strike, and from the trailers can piece together the plot in minutes, including most of the big twist.-Throw in the foreshadowing and you really are only left with how gory will the kill be and those small details you forgot about in the beginning.Violence is the Highest:\n-It's a vicious movie, and like the originals is a rated R movie for a reason.-This one though holds a savagery that exceeds the previous and so be careful because you are going to get things that might be disturbing enough to make you sick.-The sounds with the vicious actions are not holding back, with gruesome gore and death awaiting those at every scene. And sometimes it gets a tad excessive to go the routes, even though they add a bit of diversity.The Suspense/Mystery/Action are lacking\n-It depends on what gives you the thrills and chills, but for me, this movie did not quite accomplish the task of the most thrilling movie.-Sure , it's got the justice action that delivers that moral satisfaction, but the journey to get there is a little bland.-Bad guys are cruel, with awful tempers, and degrading features, but they aren't the worst bunch in the land, nor really that imposing of rivals.-Even when the stakes get heated, this supposed antagonist group is quite mediocre in regards to the fight put up.-The mystery and the motivation behind it are realistic with the tones, but without that spark is rather bland nor mind blowing when the answers come out.-And as for the fights, again Equalizer 1 and 2 do more than this one, still showing Denzel being awesome, but just one sided and kind of lackluster in terms of the most stylish or unique finishes.The VERDICT:\nEqualizer 3 succeeds on many levels for a third installment tying things up with the finish and polish that you hope this series will have. The movie has great sound editing and visual style that does a lot of the lifting and adds that edge this series is known to have. A strong acting crew further helps paint this little Italian family together, blending that attitude with good characters that become the central story component of this series. And with it, the story and morals that this series has are good, primarily the heavy moral components and the way it ties to the cold hard steel man that visits it. It holds so many great moments that really are that justice dealing goodness, with a set of finishes that though violent, hold so much bite to them in many ways. And to seal and tie everything together the way they did it, was classy and in check with the series. However, the movie is extremely dark and gory, easily earning the rated R mark and sometimes to a degree that is going to make people potentially not comfortable secondary to the level of extreme violence that was on profile. Sadly, the story, mystery, and the action did not quite make the violence and darkness not worth the investment at times, at least in terms of an action thriller sense. The endings of the others held that merit and wow factor, but this one, though again cool, just doesn't have that same spectacle or intensity the others did. Thus, it loses points in that regards, at least for this reviewer. Factoring all these together, my scores are:Action/Crime/Thriller: 8.0\nMovie Overall: 7.0.",
    "92": "Equalizer 3 marks the epitome of vigilante action, masterfully directed by Antoine Fuqua and led by the indomitable Denzel Washington as Robert McCall. This finale exudes a riveting blend of vengeance and virtue, set against the picturesque yet perilous backdrop of Southern Italy, a departure from the urban sprawl we're accustomed to from its predecessors.The narrative unfolds with a sinister Sicilian mobster's world coming undone, an ode to McCall's relentless quest for justice. Washington's embodiment of a righteous avenger resonates with a sense of authenticity that is as engaging as it is awe-inspiring. His transition from a humble dweller to a harbinger of retribution is seamless, affirming his prowess in action-heavy roles, despite the generational gap with contemporary action stars.The film doesn't shy away from delivering a gleefully violent spectacle, with each punch thrown and bullet fired reverberating the core essence of McCall's crusade against the unyielding Sicilian Mafia. The atmospheric tension is palpable, bearing the signature touch of Fuqua's directorial finesse. Amidst the relentless action, what shines through is McCall's affinity for the innocuous folk of his newfound haven, accentuating the dichotomy of his violent endeavors and his quest for tranquility.Equalizer 3 also subtly explores McCall's coping with the ghosts of his past, while forging ahead on a merciless path of retribution. Though the subplot involving Emma, a young CIA analyst, leaves something to be desired, it doesn't detract from the film's core narrative.The narrative rhythm is maintained with meticulous care, ensuring a robust pace that keeps the adrenaline pumping, yet providing those moments of reflection, showcasing a meditative side amidst a storm of violence.In closing, Equalizer 3 isn't just a movie, it's an experience that leaves you at the edge of your seat, yet introspective about the dichotomy of good and evil, and the lengths one goes to uphold justice. The film is a fitting closure to a saga that has enthralled audiences with a raw depiction of vigilante justice, embodied by an actor who continues to defy age and expectations in delivering compelling performances.",
    "93": "The Equalizer 3: McCall (Denzel Washington) is back, we find him in a wine cellar in Sicily, surrounded by dead bodies, held at gunpoint by two mafiosi until teir boss arrives with a sidekick. All four of them are soon dead, McCall being inventive, shoving a gun barrel of obne crook's eye and shooting through the back of his head, We';; have to wait a while for flashbacks to see hoe he killed the others and why hr was there in the first place. But he finds drugs associated with ISIS. Soon the CIA are involved including Dakota Fanning as an agent newly sent from a desk job to the field.A wounded McCall is nursed back to health by a Doctor in a small town (shades of Jason Bourne) near Naples. He takes to the town and ir;s inhabitants but the Camorra are extorting money from local businesses and their main branch in Naples want to take over the town to build a resort. Of course they come into conflict with McCall, All of the strands tie together eventually with a few surprises and plot twists along the way. A tale of terrorism, drug dealing, the Camorra, police corruption and parts of McCall's history and sense of obligation. Bloody, violent, once again MCCalli's more akin to a Superhero than an ordinary assassin but his violence sometimes pales in comparison to that use on ordinary people by the Camorra and ISIS. A gripping film maintaining the tension even when McCall is at peace in the small town. (This is the final film in the series but there has been talk about a prequel regarding McCall's origins.) Directed by Antoine Fuqua, written by Richard Wenk. 8/10.",
    "94": "I saw the first in 2014 and nine years later, hopefully, the conclusion to this trilogy. The main emphasis of these movies are crime and punishment. The Equalizer is like a person who punishes evil people who are beyond the reach of the law. There are so many movies like these that I will not even begin to recommend which ones for you to see. Denzel Washington is a great favorite actor of mine. I've seen countless films of his, some very good like Fallen(1998) and Deja Vu(2006). He has acted in diverse films spanning many genres. He is an actor that can make you smile or cry depending on the role he is portraying.This movie is basically just an all out war between Denzel's character Robert McCall and the Mafia. So you would typically expect over-the-top violence and action. And this is where director Antione Fuqua excels. Training Day(2001) and Tears Of The Sun(2003) are two excellent movies of his.Verdict: if you want to complete watching the trilogy then go ahead. However for me this is nothing but repetitious action and acting. If you've seen all the 80's action classics like First Blood(1982), Commando(1985), Raw Deal(1986), The Delta Force(1986), Die Hard(1988), Red Heat(1988) then give this one a skip.",
    "95": "This was the most perfectly generic action move of all time.Almost untouchable man gets injured while taking down lots of bad guyssaved by some kind old manfinds love and peace as he healssees his newly found love and peace being bulliedand then proceeds to take down the bullyall while acting like a robotic Alonso X Lucas. (Anyone else notice that Denzel Washington is the exact same person in every single movie he's been in since Malcom X)The first equaliser was pretty decent, second was ok and they thought, we've got audience hooked, lets just write any old rubbish and we'll get paid and then we can retire the character.",
    "96": "It's like Modern Robinhood film.Good cinematography\nDecent music but I missed Harry's fantastic score.Action scenes were well choreographed and decentFilm is very grounded, very calm first one hour but the last one hour gives some thrillsEmotionally, this film is much better than other two, but action wise little less.Denzil steals the show as always and the other actors got good roles too.Visuals are stunningIt's not great but not bad at all.Good experience.Harry-Gregson Williams score could have provided a bang. Anyway! Thanks for the ride.I will miss this series, one of my favourites.",
    "97": "The Equalizer 3 is a strange film, so strange that I wonder how it was greenlit in the first place.The entire film takes place in Italy, and about 85% of the dialogue is in Italian. One has to admire them for doing this. It's always ridiculous in films when Russian or Italian gangsters suddenly speak English with each other. They went for realism in the language department.However, the rest of the film feels like a slow, horrible, surreal fever dream. Right off the bat the color grading jumps out at you. The colors are so desaturated, they may as well have filmed in black and white. The film opens with a landscape shot of Sicilily, and it looks like some brown-yellow-greyish mess, similar to the movie 300, but without that film's comic book stylings and bursting earthen red tones.Anyone who has ever been to Italy can attest to it being a very colorful country with usually great weather and the sunlight bringing out popping colors. Here it looks like a post-apocalyptic wasteland. This stands in stark contrast to the harmonious life the film is trying to portray.The depictions of Italians is a caricature and could be considered racist.For one, the Film depicts Italy as a crime ridden hellhole run by sadistic gangs that terrorize the people and the police, cut off people's hands, torture them, even bomb the police. It's a joke. Italy is one of the safest countries in the world. Even Germany's murder rate is twice as high. The US's murder rate is 12 times as high!I've worked in Italy multiple times and had run ins and dealings with the Mafia. They're scum. But not like in the movie.They portray Italians as tranquil peasants, sitting at cafes and wearing 1950s clothing, sitting there like sheep passing the time, waiting for mafia thugs to come and terrorize them. A scene at a school depicts the children wearing school uniforms. This hasn't been the case in Italy since Mussolini.The mafia are portrayed as thugs on motorcycles with face tattoos, who in broad daylight loot a hotel, terrorize people (a cop even) in restaurants, and feel more like stereotypical Hollywood Russian mob hitmen.In reality, the Mafia works almost entirely behind the scenes via corruption. They're invisible. They're not street thugs with face tattoos. They work in city administration, customs, transportation, construction. They mainly syphon public funds away by having controlling interests everywhere and putting people in power on their payroll (or sometimes intimidating them).In my personal case, our business had to pay bribes to the actual police. Multiple times. They threaten you with some bulls**t code violation and openly tell you they will shut you down for a few weeks and drag things out, so it's cheaper to just pay them.The Mafia would never lay hands on a policeman or cut the hand off of a chief of police like in the movie. The idea that a crime family can intimidate police is laughable. The police in Italy are as militarized as everywhere else in the world. Just a bit more corrupt. Thugs in uniform. No one in their right mind would mess with them. There's no profit in that.The mafia has its hands in everything, but they don't go around randomly butchering people, raping their children and other things alluded to in this film.So all that said, the Italy depicted here is a fantasy Italy, much like the fantasy Sparta and Persia in the aforementioned 300.I'm not faulting the film for having a fantasy setting, but if you have a fantasy setting, this should be reflected in the tone. V for Vendetta, 300, Kevin Costner's Robin Hood, Braveheart, there are tons of examples of films that distort reality to fit the tone of the story.But the tone of Equalizer 3 is... a mess. What tone were they even going for?A political spy thriller involving the Mafia, ISIS and corruption? Too unrealistic and silly.An hommage to a gritty 70s Italo crime thiller? Too sombre for that.A sombre drama? The story's too simple and the characters too thin for that.A Liam Neeson style silly violent power fantasy? Too slow and not enough action.The film lacks a coherent tonal language. The only thing that is consistent is the violence. This film is not just gory, but sadistic. While movie violence doesn't shock me anymore, in this case it still appalled me. The film revels in people being slaughtered. It's shot in a semi realistic way, but absolutely glorified. Eyes are stabbed, limbs broken until the bones exit the wounds, people are crushed by cars, hacked in the face with meat cleavers... you get the idea. One scene even depicts a killing spree in first person view like a video game. This film has no moral compass, because it presents the violence a human misery in these desaturated, naturalistic colors, while at the same time glorifying it as if it were an awesome video game killstreak.Despite all the gore, the violence is still played safe. Only men and mostly only the bad guys get it. The scene where the mafia beats up the cop in his apartment in front of his wife and daughter would have been far more effective, if they had forced him to watch them beat the wife or even daughter. But they don't get so much as a scratch. The movie tries to be hard, but chickens out where the violence would actually be shocking instead of just abrasive.As a filmmaker you have a choice when it comes to violence. You can make it cartoony and fun (i.e. Robocop), or you can go the Saving Private Ryan / Schindler's List route, keep it realistic and shocking, and focus on the suffering to tell a story. This combines the two in the worst way: Focus on the suffering and misery and present it as cool. It's akin to putting Heavy Metal over the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan.Like many modern low budget films, the pacing is extremely slow. Long shots of people walking through halls, entering rooms or exiting cars pad the run time. With tighter editing, it could have been 25 minutes shorter.These are some major flaws. It doesn't help that the story is stupid, paper thin and unrealistic.However, the movie does have some undeniable qualities in terms of craftsmanship. Denzel Washington steals every scene he is in. He is supremely talented, and breathes life into his character with many little quips, little smiles, nods, the way he moves his eyes, tilts his head. There's a lot of subtlety going on.The scene with him and the CIA agent at a caf√© is a highlight in terms of both writing and acting. The dialogue is sharp and full of wit, and Denzel manages to be curteous, unassuming and dangerous at the very same time.Some of the scenes with him and the locals like the doctor or the policeman are extremely well acted as well. If you're a fan of his, you will get your money's worth. He used to be in a lot of big films, and it's a shame to see him relegated to smaller productions recently. He still feels like he could helm intelligent blockbusters like he did 30 years ago.Instead we get this.",
    "98": "I love me some Denzel Washington, God knows I do, but this is my least favorite movie with him starring in. Not because of him, but because they did waaaay too much! For starters did the camera person really need to spend the 1st five minutes of the movie walking past dead bodies. We got the point! Denzel (aka Robert McCall) killed them all. (Sorry Fuqua, you are an exceptionally talented director & the body of work you put on the big scree is awesome, believable work) But (in terms of writing) an overload of dead bodies alone, does not make a great story. A great turn of events does. Anyway... No one will probably admit it but the story line was long & unengaging. In the first two movies Denzel was a person with heart, spirit, and influence. In EQ3 he's no more than a menace, a vigilante. His killing started before we even knew why. It also seem like they weren't quite sure if they wanted to write this movie as an action flick, an emotional drama, or a travel blog and just show all the beautiful buildings, food & culture of Italy. I loved the first two installments, but this is blase at best. No wonder during an interview when the host told Denzel she was surprised to see him make a 3rd sequel, Denzel said, he thought Robert McCall had run his course too, but \"apparently they felt McCall still had work to do\". It's almost like he felt his presence in the movie was an after thought too... cause that's exactly how I felt watching it. Sure, he was in every scene, but his presence wasn't valuable enough, if you ask me. Still, I love Denzel. He hasn't loss a thing. The man commands the screen & is still one of the best actors to ever exist.",
    "99": "Denzel Washington teams up with Antoine Fuqua once again, returning to the role of Robert McCall in a solid albeit relatively formulaic threequel.The story finds McCall in Italy, where he attempts to find a semblance of peace after settling in a welcoming community. However it isn't long before the mafia starts to threaten this peace, leading McCall to flex his vigilante muscles once again.If that doesn't necessarily sound like an overly original story it's because it isn't. It follows the same story beats of most 'one man army' type films like John Wick, Taken etc. That's not to say the story is bad. It is perfectly serviceable and delivers what you'd expect, but it doesn't go beyond that.Thankfully the performance of Denzel Washington stops the film feeling overly generic, as he once again conjures up an intriguing protagonist in Robert McCall. His ability to effortlessly switch from charm and charisma to steely and calculated is brilliant to watch. He is just very believable in the role which really grounds the film.As well as this, Dakota Fanning gives a good performance and is perhaps underutilised. Her story thread does feel a little underdeveloped in truth, and maybe should have been fleshed out or dropped entirely.Speaking of being fleshed out, the villains of the piece are as generic as they come. A little more work here would have been appreciated just to add a but more interest.The action that is served up in the film is good but perhaps a tad sparse. A couple of extra sequences or an extension to the existing ones would have been welcome, and would have also helped the pacing slightly, which does feel a little off.Overall The Equalizer 3 is a pretty good ride. Antoine Fuqua doesn't push the boat out too much but he pulls together an enjoyable and engaging film that will be sure to entertain.",
    "100": "I never obsessed over The Equalizer films, I always thought they were decent action movies but I really liked the first one, it was great. I always preferred the john wick franchise over it.This one was not necessarily bad, it was alright but it feels off for some reason and it felt kinda boring, a lot of elements were missing from the previous ones such as the iconic scanning and going into Robert's head and the time counting.This one also felt long as it didn't feel like a three act film but a film with just one long act that takes the span of 2 hours.The story was kinda decent and the fight scenes were still great but I wanted to see more, the only thing that held this film apart was the scenes with Denzel, I legit didn't care about the side characters and other stuff.I still recommend watching it though.",
    "101": "This was definitely the worst out of the trilogy. It lacks the action that you definitely associate with The Equalizer, even if the opening seemed to be especially brutal. In fact, much of the movie doesn't really strike me as a film that Antoine Fuqua had much involvement in. McCall doesn't seem to scan the environment for weapons or even do much of what the title implies he does. Ninety percent of the film is him spending time in a small town just hanging out with the locals, with Mafia thrown in for a couple of scenes as an afterthought.That, and half of the film seems to focus on Dakota Fanning's character, who isn't really interesting enough to hold your attention for a terrorism subplot that serves as an afterthought.That, and the movie just ends on an anti-climax that wasn't exactly riveting. The fact most reviews on here are giving this movie 8 or 9 stars is wildly suspicious. That being said, Denzel gives his all, as always, and still ends the movie as an interesting character, as always.",
    "102": "I can not understand the many good reviews . In my opinion one of the worst films I've ever seen.The film is very superficial, there is hardly any meaning. Except for senseless and many brutal deaths, the dramaturgy is just worse.The film has no depth in either the characters or the story itself. The film is artificially lengthened by many unnecessary scenes that are unnecessarily long, as if you were stretching chewing gum.There is hardly any character building, the roles all seem very superficial and weak. You hardly learn anything about the new person in the film, many questions are not answered or only answered very vaguely.The screenwriters, directors of this story and the dramaturgy failed here. My reviews are pretty harsh, I know I'm usually more of a positive reviewer, but I'm just plain disappointed here.The only nice thing is the scenery and the places that have been chosen.",
    "103": "I've enjoyed the first 2 offerings with Denzel.ButThe first 2 had much more reason, much more thought behind the reason for the violenceEqualizer 3 is very violent , excessively so , and with minimum explanation as to why .Somebody behind Equalizer 3 has thought that the most important factor is the violence. The more violent the better the film. They didn't understand that it's the story is what makes the film, understanding the how when and why of the characters and their world.So this offering is really really violent but without justification. Even why McCall is in Italy is only lamely and glibly explained at the end of the film.Shame and waste of opportunity .Would I watch again ? No (but i would and have the previous 2 films)",
    "104": "In Sicily, crime boss Lorenzo Vitale and his son are returning home to find lots of dead bodies. Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is being held prisoner but not for long. After more killings, he is wounded but escapes. He finds safety in a city threatened by other criminals. He calls the CIA and gets operative Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning).Denzel Washington is doing super-fighting and director Antoine Fuqua is bringing his cinematic style. The partnership continues to be solid although the movie franchise keeps drifting away from the original TV premise. This could be any number of avenging vigilante ex-spy superhero. Let's be honest. Denzel is almost seventy. It's less and less reasonable for him to still be super fighting. He needs to fight with experience and brains more than brawn. My favorite scene is the restaurant where he does exactly that. I'm fine with the general idea of a black John Wick or Jason Bourne. Denzel is probably aging out of that role. Everything else is fine. I didn't actually recognize Dakota Fanning although I kept thinking that she looks familiar. Denzel's age does keep bugging me throughout the movie.",
    "105": "If you're an absolute action fanatic, and you're hoping to see plenty of it in this, lower those expectations now. While there are some fantastic action scenes at the beginning and end, the middle is where things really slow down. Literally like half of this movie is just showing McCall's ordinary day-to-day life in Sicily, which was to me, a very surprising decision by Antoine Fuqua, since anybody with a brain would know that an overwhelming majority of the moviegoers for this are gonna be die-hard action fans, yet this film possibly has the least of that out of the whole trilogy. But what annoys me the most is the fact that our protagonist, our *main* character, barely even has a role in the plot that unfolds. He starts and finishes the story, but other than that, he's almost entirely unnecessary! It's actually Dakota Fanning's character that keeps the story ticking along, and then every now and then Denzel Washington's character drops in a bit of key information to make it *seem* like he's majorly involved. And linking to this, where on Earth does he even get this information from? This was actually a recurring theme throughout the series (so not just in this sequel), but still, certain things just don't have any clear explanation, like for example, how did he figure out the bad guys' location? It doesn't at all make sense. All they had to do was show us how he managed to find out these elusive details and the movie would have flowed along nicely. But as a result of not doing this, it feels like the film untimely jumps straight into the action.But anyway, I'm talking way too negatively about a picture that I actually had a lot of fun with. Even though it does just mainly depict an old man going about his day in a friendly, sociable area of Italy, I strangely didn't get bored in the slightest, even though I could easily describe it as boring (if you can somehow understand what I mean). And the action sequences were epic, just as they were in the prequels to this. Not one bit dragged for me.In conclusion, whilst I'm ever so slightly disappointed that they didn't end on a big one, I am still very satisfied with my cinema trip, as it was a great feature to kick back to and take in.",
    "106": "I thought this was a big improvement from The Equaliser 2 in terms of story, action, and the overall watching experience.Denzel Washington returns great as always bringing the character of Robert McCall to life. Denzel's character never gets old, the cool, calm, and collected demeanour that can easily switch to a cold blooded assassin at the beep of his watch.As with the other instalments to this series, we are in a completely different scenario, this time in southern Italy where Robert McCall faces off against drug smugglers that use their income for terroristic-like endeavours.The first instalment of this series introduced us to Robert McCall and how ruthless he can be. The third instalment being this one, did not disappoint and encapsulated Denzel's character.I rate The Equaliser 3 a 7/10 as it wasn't better than the first one but was an important upon the second one and because of the story and action sequences.",
    "107": "This Sorta-Senior-Bourne does not Equate the greatness of the first two and yet, still gets a solid recommendation. Only, catch it on streaming.While I really did have a good time here and cherished the baddies getting 10x more than they deserved, this is definitely a SKIP-theatres kind of movie. On the surface, it looks like it would have grand cinematography, but it really doesn't. They truly made an interesting and picturesque Italian village look dull and boring.\"Retired\" Superspy Roberto McCall finally feels some of the pain he dishes out when he gets wounded during one of his many vigilante adventures. In about half the movie's time, he heals in a foreign land, gets warmly welcomed and has enough encounters with the local thugs, his mouth waters once more for vengeance.One thing that ultimately let me down was the lack of episodic \"heroism\" scenes. This was based on the weekly television action-drama of the 80s about an ex-CIA agent stealthy helping the needy and punishing the criminals. One thing they did great in both parts 1 and 2 was making you feel like you've seen a half-season worth of episodes/climaxes within the runtime. This was sadly absent in the supposed \"final chapter.\"Instead, this boiled down to just two linked Italian Jobs. And for the majority of the movie, he's the \"getting too old for this stuff\" recovering patient. Most of this action movie is just as slow as the first chapter and while I did like the world-building/character-developing, I would have loved to see him more able than disabled. Plus, the story had all the beats you needed, they just weren't all felt.And yet...I did have fun. The small sparks of the old Robert McCall were really nice. I mean, Denzel Washington. The name says it. Even in his worst movies, he shines. And he still charmed me to death.I do love how consistent this franchise is. Yes, this was the weakest entry, but still dang enjoyable. Plus, I love how HARD-R this is. In the few kill-moments, Robert doesn't mess around. SOOO glad this wasn't PG13.Overall, if you liked the first two, there isn't a reason to not make this a trilogy night. And if you're worried about this going on too long, keep in mind: mercifully, each installment gets shorter and shorter.Listen up Hollywood, PLEASE make shorter movies. I really can't bare to go into another 3-hour movie, especially ones you already told us was just the first part of two. Egah, too long!***Final Thoughts: Not that long of a franchise, even though it's been going on for about a decade now, but here's my ranking:1. The Equalizer (2014) 4/5 Stars - Barely edges out #2, almost a tie.2. The Equalizer 2 (2018) 4/5 Stars.3. The Equalizer (2023) 3¬Ω/5 Stars.",
    "108": "Denzel Washington as Robert McCall is back in THE EQUALIZER 3. But this time, he has decided to retire and settle in Southern Italy, enjoy a peaceful life, and make some local friends. Of course, as you would expect in an Equalizer movie, it doesn't stay quiet for long, and McCall discovers that his new friends are under the control of local crime bosses - and he wants to protect them.The Equalizer 3 gets off to a slow start, but by the second half of the movie, things pick up. Of course, the plot is predictable, and there is nothing original about it. The action scenes are well choreographed and intense, contrasting with the beautiful Southern Italy backdrop to what is going on.As usual, the tone of the movie is gritty, with rare moments of humour. Denzel Washington puts in a solid performance as Robert McCall. The rest of the cast is forgettable. The story superficially skates across themes of redemption, justice, and family. There's nothing new. I enjoyed the soundtrack, but it's standard stuff for an action movie. The dialogue is ok but doesn't have any memorable lines.I was entertained by Equalizer 3, but there's nothing much to be emotionally invested in, and it is a by-the-numbers action movie with lots of explicit violence. The theme of community and family probably resonated with me the most.If you are looking for an action movie to pass the time, particularly if you have seen the other two Equalizer movies, I'd check this out. But don't expect a groundbreaking film with original ideas. Take plenty of popcorn!",
    "109": "What a beautiful story and excellent movie.This third movie is like watching a masterpiece. This movie also shows us the beauty of Italy and the Italian culture.Denzel Washingtons acting is superb. The way he acts by his face expressions,With his body language,by his looks and With his words is awesome to watch. Antoine Fuqua is a very talented director and in my opinion he has created a masterpiece.Fuqua directed both the Equalizer and the Equalizer 2 in an excellent way. All the Equalizer movies has different stories and maybee this is the most beutiful story of the three movies.The Equalizer 3 Its a great story who is getting personal for the wiewer and the message is:we can all contribute to do this world a better place.The filming is so good that it feels like you are two steps behind Mc Call and can follow every step he takes during the whole movie.Great acting also from Dakota Fanning and Remo Girone and from many others of the actors in this movie.Robert McCall is personifying a person who is doing this world a better place to be in and what we can learn from this movie is that we all can contribute to do this world a better place to be in.In this movie we get to know Robert McCalls human side more. We can feel how he like all human beeings are facing situations every day where he can choose to help others and then reap the joy to see others rejoice.Excellent movie who deserves to be watched many times!I hope that Robert McCall Will be back in Equalizer 4\nThis franchise is even better than the James Bond franchise and the world gets a better place for every The Equalizer movie that is released.Martin Berger (Prague Czech Republic)",
    "110": "I was really excited to see Denzel back in action and went to watch in theatres the first day itself but honestly it was bad. It had the nuance and potential to be a great concluding chapter in the Equalizer series but it didn't do the character any justice. Somewhere along the way, the director, Antoine Fuqua lost the charm of how he made the first Equalizer great: with riveting and inventive action that keeps you glued to the screen. This movie doesn't have that. The opening act was cool but after that, the movie goes stale and bland for a long time until the end of the second half but even the climax of the movie wasn't properly done. You can easily predict what would happen in the movie pretty easily and if you have watched the trailer, there's actually nothing more to be seen cause they have included all the good portions of the movie in the trailer. Thankfully I didn't watch the trailer and so atleast, that was an advantage for me but even then, the movie is simply put: boring. I've even liked the second movie but this one is really bad! It felt like the movie didn't have a proper script and they just wanted to release a movie just to say that they've completed a trilogy!",
    "111": "The Equalizer 3 is essentially the The Seven Samurai minus six of them.Director Antoine Fuqua goes for something slow burn ramped up with shocking bursts of violence.After taking out a cyberterrorist and crime lord in Sicily. Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) discovers that they were also importing synthesised amphetamines from Jihadis in Syria. McCall later gets shot in the back by a little kid.He is saved by a passing policeman who takes him to a kindly doctor. As McCall recovers in a small Amalfi coastal town. He finds out that a Mafia gangster is planning to turn the town into a swanky casino resort. Just as he begins to view that town as his home.Fuqua at times make the movie like a beautifully shot travelogue. You would think it was a paid product placement for the Italian Tourism Board.After the opening scenes, it takes a while for McCall to crack some bones. Well he is recuperating himself. Once he does get better, McCall opts for some cold hard violence on the bad guys.I was surprised that McCall was shocked that the Mafia run the show in southern Italy.",
    "112": "The first installment was simply beautiful, and the second lived up to the same standard. However, this latest one-come on, it felt like they were pushing it onto the audience.Denzel, well, he does make it look super cool and extra entertaining, but this one doesn't quite reach the level set by the first two editions.This is the reason for a bit of disappointment; you start watching with very high expectations, solely because of the brilliance of the first two parts. However, as you progress, you find that it doesn't quite measure up to the same standard. While the concept of taking the fight abroad was good, the plot, its presentation, and the failure to maintain the character tidiness while executing the action are among the reasons for my disappointment.Nevertheless, if you've seen the first two, it's worth watching the third, especially for Denzel.",
    "113": "Considering that the two previous installments had been quite good ones(especially the first one), I had pretty high expectations for the movie. Unfortunately after watching it, I found myself feeling like I had been one of the bad guys in this movie, but with less gore.One has to wonder that if Fuque and Denzel were spending good time on the beautiful coast and decided that they might as well do a movie? So shallow and thoughtless it feels sometimes that even the fish in the movie might have problems swimming.One of the biggest issues of the film are relationships which Robert/o creates. When compared to the previous films, I found myself caring much less what happens to the people involved. For example in the first movie there was a lot of story arch for the young female character and you really felt it. Also it was clear to see how much Robert was struggling with his conscience. In this movie he appeared almost sadistic sometimes. In the second movie the character bonds were much stronger and the people were interesting. These \"civilians\" and criminals were way more one dimensional.As some of the previous reviewers have pointed out, we are starting to stretch the limits of imagination way too much. Obviously Robert has always been more or less fantasy character but this time we are taking things up to the notch. Also multiple scenes in the movie are not realistic at all or something what would really happen in the current criminal world. After all, this does not happen in Mexico or some parts of Africa or during the last century.The slow tempo did not really bother me and I liked Roberto having a plenty of cups of tea. Cinematography is the clear winner of the movie and Italy looks stunning, so much so that the country could consider hiring Antoine as a creator of travel ads. Music is quite good too but it makes me wonder what Harry could have achieved with this one.The film serie is known for it brutal action sequences but for those people who expect more of that, may feel like they have been gut punched by Roberto because after all, there is very little action and it's rather boring when compared to the previous films of the trilogy. The final action part is very disappointing and it almost feels like all the wine bottles were put into the basket of the beginning scene.I have been pondering between 5 and 6 but since we can't give half points, I have to rise it to 6 and there are indeed some redeeming qualities like the beautiful cinematography. But for those who are after more realism and depth in their dishes, this smells like an \"expired\" fish. So stick with the previous titles, you get more soul and some.",
    "114": "Does the third entry in the Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington Equalizer series do anything you wouldn't expect or give you anything you wouldn't wish to receive? Absolutely not, but that's entirely the point in a surprisingly solid third outing for Washington's Robert McCall as he finds himself on a not so relaxing holiday to Italy.A much more entertaining and well-rounded outing than the trite second chapter that seemed to suggest McCall should stay retired for good, Equalizer 3 is the biggest step yet into exploitation territory, marked by a grisly opening act and a procession of gory yet also cartoonish violence that sees both Fuqua and Washington revel in the excesses of their over the top story that hides nothing about its true identity and wears it like a brand new hat from a clothing store.There's no doubt a film of this ilk is below someone as talented as Washington but it's also a guilty pleasure joy to see such a talented performer embrace such a simplistic yet uncomplicated outing that does what it says it will on the box and does it well and while Washington may here be teaming up with his Man on Fire partner Dakota Fanning as upstart government agent Emma Collins, this is very much the Washington show and a show he commands with a simply facial expression or a gun through the eye.Moving the McCall action from the United States to Italy is also a strong move for Fuqua's film with the seaside set locale in Southern Italy allowing for a lot of solid moments of eye candy around the cheese-riddled dialogue, the questionable friendship/romance arcs and side plots about kindly fisherman and while there may be less action than some might expect from a film brandished with the Equalizer name, when McCall gets going he makes it worth your time, gleefully dispatching Bond like baddies as if his a blood relative of John Wick, ensuring fans will be satiated with the carnage they are given.Unlikely to win any new fans, this old school action/thriller that feels like a product of a bygone era is a competent and effective genre offering that is unashamed of what it is and at all times aware of what it isn't, giving us an entertaining \"final\" chapter to the exploits of one of Washington's most over the top yet memorable characters.Final Say -A refreshingly old school action flick that's journey into exploitation cinema may surprise fans of the first two outings, The Equalizer 3 doesn't have a lot of depth or meat on its bones but thanks to a commanding Washington, a great location and some intense action, The Equalizer 3 is sure to appease.3 1/2 ice buckets out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",
    "115": "Anyone remember the little tune that went with the Edward Woodward television series? Well you won't hear it here in this rather procedural vehicle for Denzel Washington. His usually meticulous planning is compromised by a young lad with a rifle. This leaves \"McCall\" needing the care of a doctor \"Enzo\" (Remo Girone) in a small Sicilian town that is about to become the centre of the venal ambitions of \"Vincent\" (Andrea Scarduzio) and his henchman younger brother \"Marco\" (Andrea Dodero) who uses his team of thugs to extort from the local businesses. It's only a matter of time before heads clash and, well - you can guess the rest of this actually rather brutally predictable drama. Dakota Fanning appears now and again in a rather unnecessary sub-plot involving the CIA and some Syrian narcotics smugglers that is really undercooked - but for the most part this is really just Denzel being, well, Denzel on his quest to save his new-found friends from the grip of the unscrupulous Camorra. It's overlong for what it is, and I found Washington's performance to be rather sluggish throughout before a denouement that came across as rather simplistically rushed. It's fine, but forgettable.",
    "116": "The Equalizer 3 is an action-packed thriller that delivers on many fronts, earning a solid 7 stars out of 10. While the movie had its moments of excitement and intrigue, it did fall short in a couple of key areas, hence the slightly lower rating.Let's start with the positives. Denzel Washington once again shines in his role as Robert McCall, the enigmatic vigilante with a heart of gold. His performance is nothing short of stellar, and his portrayal of McCall's unwavering dedication to justice is a true highlight of the film. The action sequences, when they do occur, are intense and well-executed, showcasing McCall's lethal skills and resourcefulness.The storyline, though not groundbreaking, keeps you engaged throughout, as McCall embarks on another mission to right the wrongs of the world. The supporting cast also delivers commendable performances, adding depth to the characters and the overall narrative.However, where The Equalizer 3 falls short is in the absence of those iconic slow-motion scenes that have become synonymous with the franchise. These moments added a unique flair to the previous films, and their absence is certainly felt. Additionally, the film's pacing was a bit slow at times, causing certain scenes to drag on longer than necessary. Tightening up the editing and injecting more adrenaline-pumping action could have improved the overall viewing experience.In conclusion, The Equalizer 3 is a solid addition to the franchise, with Denzel Washington's magnetic presence and a compelling storyline. While it may not reach the heights of its predecessors due to the missing iconic slow-motion scenes and occasional pacing issues, it still delivers enough thrills and excitement to warrant a 7-star rating. Fans of the series will undoubtedly enjoy this latest installment, and it's worth a watch for anyone seeking an action-packed evening at the movies.",
    "117": "Greetings from the other side. I enjoyed the first two Equalizer movies, so I was excited to see number 3. Was I ever disappointed! Heck, I didn't even watch the entire movie. I got to around 2/3 and then picked up my phone and whatever. Since the movie no longer interested me, I was half-watching it until the end.This movie was SO BORING. I see other reviews telling us that the scenery was beautiful, and that's because there is no action or anything else to watch. They show us Denzel walking down stairs with a cane, Denzel drinking tea, and Denzel going up the stairs with his cane. Most movies wouldn't show us the entire journey up and down the stairs, but this one does.There was so very little action, that it shouldn't have been called an Equalizer movie, but something else. It was like a bait and switch. I'm not even sure what the heck is was about. The intro was good, and I got excited because it was Denzel killing bad guy butt, but then it was just the camera following him around like he was on vacation, and it was boring as hell.I tried watching this a couple months ago, and I got bored and did something else. I tried again tonight and the same thing happened.Sadly, I cannot recommend this movie. That bogus Equalizer TV series with Queen Latifh is a joke as well. She is a great actress, but she can't pull off that role. So many cuts during her fight scenes that you could fall into an epileptic seizure. Plus that kid of hers is annoying as hell, and having a kid on this type of show is just silly.",
    "118": "Denzel Washington is one of those actors who raises a movie's quality and value just by being in it.Interestingly enough, John Wick sailed off into the sunset not long ago. The characters share some DNA, but their worlds are entirely different. One borders on fantasy, the other tries to stay grounded in the real world. Wick finished with (IMO) the weakest of the series.Equalizer has a tenuous hold on reality, because, as happens with most action movies, the action sequences stretch the laws of physics.But ultimately, because Denzel Washington is a better actor than Reeves, and his character has more backstory, Equalizer 3 wraps up the series in satisfactory fashion. The action is fun, Denzel provides the gravitas, and the story concludes in okay layers.As with most series like this, the original is the best. But a good actor is like a tide that that floats all boats.Recommended.",
    "119": "The third & final entry in Denzel Washington/Antonie Fuqua's big screen adaptation of the old Edward Woodward TV show. Opening up on a literal blaze of gunfire, Washington mows down some baddies in an Italian winery but unfortunately catches a bullet from a fleeing child. Winding his way to safety in his car he finally passes out by the side of the road where a kindly constable, Eugenio Mastrandrea, whisks him to an equally sympathetic doctor, Remo Girone, at their village where he heals Washington up w/o asking the who's or why's. Washington does indeed heal both body & mind but surprisingly his spirit as well as he takes to the small hamlet as his own especially when the Mafia starts to make moves on his new neighbors forcing his hand to strike back. Washington & Fuqua have I assume after making 5 films together (Training Day & the Magnificent Seven remake round our their collection) have established an easy shorthand together w/each artist complimenting each other which puts the viewer in a relaxed frame of mind in what they're about to watch w/be something special w/this outing (which I hope is not their last) as good as their others. Also starring David Denham, from Greenland, as a CIA operative & Dakota Fanning reuniting w/Washington for the first time in nearly 20 years playing Washington's connection into his old life.",
    "120": "5 years since the last film in the equaliser franchise and Denzel Washington is back as Robert McCall. For anyone not in the know Robert McCall is a bit like a John Kramer character who deals out justice to those who may have continued to get away with their actions otherwise. Unlike Kramers use of traps though McCall prefers a good old fashioned shotgun, Sniper or pistol, you get the idea. This time around he finds himself in a small town in Southern Italy being attended to by a doctor after taking a bullet to the back in the films prologue. He begins to get used to the fine things Italy is known for such as their food, hospitality and oh yeah drug smuggling gangs.Just as he starts to feel like he's found the perfect place to retire his break is interrupted by a gang called the Camorra who without going into spoiler territory essentially plan to take the town for themselves.It feels somewhat unfair to compare this film to the likes of John Wick Chapter 4 as yes of course they would both fit into the same genre as they're both action films. That being said however it's a bit like comparing CS:GO with Call Of Duty, yes they're in the same genre, they're both online multiplayer first person shooters but at the same time they're very different. This film is very much like the CS:GO to John Wicks Call Of Duty. Robert McCall is much more methodical and spends more time planning than taking action this does mean that there's overall less action in this film compared to say the likes of John Wick. I don't think that's a bad thing though as what action there is in the film is impactful and I have to say a lot bloodier than I had anticipated it being. The trade we get with less action scenes is an all together much more grounded story. We see the damage this gang is causing to the people of this tight nit community and as the audience we are fully onboard and are just waiting for McCall to strike. That being said it does also mean that this isn't an action film for all fans of the genre it's a much more realistic story and sets itself and the franchise away from the likes of the John Wick films.Overall this was an enjoyable way to spend a late Monday afternoon and it's great to see Denzel Washington back where he belongs on the big screen after a short hiatus.Rating: 7/10.",
    "121": "First thing about this movie: this movie is incredibly shot. We get a GOOD look at Italy and we feel like we are a part of this city. It's extremely well done.The second thing about this movie: Denzel is amazing. The director - Antoine Fuqua (previously in Training Day) is reunited to make this masterpiece. This movie is very character-driven, so anyone watching this will UNDERSTAND why Robert McCall is such a beloved character.I took off a star because of the pacing issues. It's a little slow at times, but it's clear they wanted more story than action. The characters are good. The actors did a great job in making you like or hate them.There's a quote that I'm paraphrasing here, but the idea is there. A good man doesn't know if they are a good or bad person.",
    "122": "Equaliser 3It got off to a very slow start, however this pace was all part of a very well planned story that required lots of comprehensive characters, and there were a lot of them. Some of them were really violent, threatening small time thugs that enjoyed torturing innocent and defenceless people, this is the setting for our hero to settle some scores. The story only made sense at the end so you have to be patient.A few things irritated, the subtitles it was practically an all Italian movie.Slowly but surely the tension built and hero delivered in spades, the camerawork was inspired as were the medieval settings, apart from the Mafiosa types lol, I want to get on a plane tomorrow and visit this beautiful place.Overall this was a really great movie and Densiel was inspired. I'm giving this a really firm 8, it didn't disappoint, but beware there is one terribly gory scene that you might want to hide behind your blanket.",
    "123": "All three Equalizer movies make the audience not only hate the villains but also the villains' culture and nation. In Equalizer 1, the Russian mafia and Russians in general are described as evil. It's difficult to distinguish the villains from their cultures. The Russian mafia regional boss who dies on the funky floor disdains the entire American people by saying \"You Americans think you can buy whatever you want.\" In Equalizer 2, there is even less sympathy for the Turkish father who abducts his daughter from his ex-wife only to hurt her. The audience gets the feeling that not only this Turkish man but also his entire culture is complicit in this crime because the Turkish culture is mysogynistic and patriarchical. About Denzel's African-American sidekick painter, one can't decide whether to root for him or to give up on the African-American male culture which drives men to crime. As for Equalizer 3, I got the feeling that Italy is so powerless about the organized crime that the innocent peace-loving people and the police must all bow before the omnipotent Camorrah. Although the audience roots for the good Italians, it also learns to fear the loss of government control over crime in Italy. The only good guys are the CIA, which is a strange way of looking at the world.",
    "124": "The Equalizer 3 (2023) is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the popular action trilogy, starring Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, a retired government operative who now uses his skills to help those who cannot help themselves.In this installment, McCall finds himself drawn into a conflict with the Sicilian Mafia, after his best friend is killed in a seemingly random attack. McCall travels to Sicily to investigate, and soon finds himself caught up in a web of deceit and violence.Washington is once again superb as McCall, bringing a quiet intensity and gravitas to the role. He is equally convincing in both the action scenes and the more dramatic moments. The supporting cast is also excellent, with Dakota Fanning, Remo Girone, and Eugenio Mastrandrea all delivering memorable performances.Director Antoine Fuqua crafts a visually stunning film, with sweeping shots of the Sicilian countryside and picturesque villages. The action sequences are brutal and unflinching, but they are also well-choreographed and exciting to watch.The Equalizer 3 is a must-see for fans of the franchise, and it is also a great film for fans of action movies in general. It is a well-made and entertaining film with a strong performance from Denzel Washington.Here are some of the things that I particularly loved about the film:The Sicilian setting is beautiful and atmospheric, and it provides a fresh backdrop for the action.The supporting cast is excellent, and they all have good chemistry with Washington.The action sequences are brutal and intense, but they are also well-choreographed and exciting to watch.Washington gives a masterful performance as McCall, bringing a quiet intensity and gravitas to the role.The film has a satisfying conclusion that wraps up the trilogy nicely.Overall, The Equalizer 3 is a thrilling and satisfying action film that is sure to please fans of the franchise and fans of the genre in general. I highly recommend it. So many films I have seen this year that I felt wasn't worth the cost of a movie ticket, but I didn't have that feeling with this one. I really enjoyed it and in my opinion, its the best of the Denzel trilogy.",

The Equalizer 3 is exactly what I expected and a bit more. Denzel Washington is the calm before the storm, the \"Jackal and Hyde\" of justice and this is a really bloody fun feel good film.Cast - Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, David Denman, Sonia Ammar, Remo Girone.",
    "126": "I approached the theatre with minimal expectations, given that \"Equalizer 2\" had failed to live up to its predecessor's standard. Nonetheless, watching seasoned actors like Denzel Washington and Liam Neeson, both in their 70s, deliver relentless action remains a guilty pleasure of mine. Denzel's films consistently resonate more deeply with me, thanks to the emotional depth he brings, which is sometimes lacking in Liam's recent work.To my surprise, this sequel exceeded my expectations regarding its grounded and gritty nature. Denzel, a once-in-a-lifetime actor, excels at conveying vulnerability and loneliness through his expressive eyes and facial expressions. In this movie, he expertly portrays a character torn between conflicting emotions - doing the right thing or walking away.Director Antoine Fuqua, renowned for his ability to depict violence and its consequences, doesn't disappoint in this regard. The screenplay is tightly woven, with the first half focusing on the protagonist's quest for community and a sense of belonging.The cinematography is exceptional, beautifully capturing the picturesque Italian towns.A special mention goes to Dakota Fanning's inclusion despite her limited screen time. Her chemistry with Denzel shines, evoking nostalgia for their previous collaboration in \"Man on Fire.\"Throughout the film, a recurring dialogue emphasizes that \"you are where you were supposed to be,\" while Denzel's character grapples with feelings of being lost. Strangely, after the movie's conclusion, I reflected on the same sentiment.",
    "127": "The Equalizer has went the opposite direction of John Wick. While John Wick has become more and more action-filled and chaotic, The Equalizer has toned the action down in favor of more meaningful scenes and tone. But there is power in the pause! After learning from the first films what Robert McCall is capable of, every scene where he does not act on his abilities makes more of an impact. Instead of getting bored from tediously long action scenes, you get the suspense of waiting for hell breaking loose. And when it does, it is glorious.This movie is not without faults. It introduces some new characters that frankly doesn't need to be there as they don't affect the plot at all, and the ending is somewhat lackluster.The story itself is a pretty standard affair, but it is excellently excecuted. Throughout it you develop empathy for the right characters, antipathy for the others, and in general get a sense of the stakes at hand.All in all, this is, by a small margin, my favorite outing in the series.",
    "128": "The Equalizer 3 continues with the story of Robert McCall(Denzel Washington), after the events of The Equalizer(2014) & The Equalizer 2(2018). Now living in Southern Italy, McCall learns that his new friends are being threatened by the local Italian mafia. When the situation becomes extremely grave, Robert McCall will do what he does best. Dishing out his severe methods, to protect his newfound friends & home.The Equalizer 3 is a great film. Director Antoine Fuqua has given us a movie that perfectly concludes The Equalizer franchise. The action set pieces are mind-blowing. Italy has been gorgeously captured, by cinematographer Robert Richardson. However, the first half of the movie is quite dragging. The performances are superlative. Denzel Washington steals the show, as Robert McCall. Washington gives us another flawless performance, like always. Dakota Fanning is spectacular as Emma Collins. The supporting cast is fantastic. The Equalizer 3 is a must watch for fans of this franchise & Denzel Washington fans. Just lower your expectations & you won't be disappointed.",
    "129": "The plot seems like it was taken from a 4-year-old and expanded upon - poorly.Every action in the film felt unjustified, unbelievable, and underwhelming.Character development was sub-par, taking the reasonable yet haunted character from the first two films and making him an untenable sociopath, at times irreconcilable with himself in the same film. Everyone else in the film was a cardboard cut out, even the love interest that goes nowhere and merely serves as a) eye candy, and b) someone the main character can be \"empathetic\" with to offset his apparent psychosis, thereby giving the audience a slim thread of likability to hang on to.The action was mediocre at best. The \"let's all stick together\", syrupy-sweet relationships that develop are hackneyed and implausible.I don't fault Mr. Washington for this tripe, he's an excellent actor. It genuinely feels as if the writers threw this together in a couple of weeks, high on adrenaline and whatever else, and genuinely thought it was passable. It wasn't.Truthfully, I've never been a fan of Mr. Fuqua, except for a couple of his films. Just about everything he's done has attempted to be grandiose and elevating and merely gets to \"meh\" on the meter.Anyway, watch the film. If you like it because coastal Italy seems exotic to you, great. But don't be afraid to come to terms with disliking it within the first 45 minutes and turning it off.",
    "130": "\"What happens here, happens in many towns. The mafia. They're like cancer. No cure.\" Enzo Arisio (Remo Girone)The good doctor of a picturesque Amalfi coastal town is about to discover that his patient, the imposing anonymous Black man, Robert (Denzel Washington), can cure that cancer. It's all a fantasy, of course, but a durable one.Just like our formulaic Westerns, our vigilante motif lives where the stranger comes into town and changes things. Considering the long tradition of spaghetti westerns, Italy is a comfortable place for our good versus evil shootouts.This third and presumably last installment of its franchise, The Equalizer 3 has much less of a body count than, say, in John Wicke, but far more heart and soul as it zeroes in on the masterfully understated expressions of the Oscar-winning star. While the Wicke franchise offers bloody ballet, Equalizer McCall offers terse no nonsense: \"Nine seconds. That's what I'll give you to decide your fate.\"Why this retired government assassin lands here is uncertain, but it is certain that while he grows loving toward the town, he is equally appalled by the Camorra mafia's blatant drug smuggling and abuse of the townspeople. He will have none of that.In a series of bloody set pieces, especially the painful \"arm wrestling\" encounter, Robert begins to set things straight. Helped by the luscious cinematography of Tarantino's lenser, Robert Richardson, with the pure white town spotted in red, director Antoine Fuqua and screenwriter Richard Wenk capture the beautiful vulnerability of a former medieval fishing town confronting the messy brutality of modernity.Like most others in the audience, I know what is coming to the bad guys as this improbable savior whitewashes the bloody town to make it pure again. Because this is allegedly Washington's swan song as Robert McCall, we watch more intently the professional assassin of The Equalizer 3 put to order the other not so smart assassins.My delight is the comfort that comes from seeing the bad guys get what they deserve because they are getting away with murder of various kinds in our real world.",
    "131": "In the cinematic world of \"The Equalizer 3,\" Denzel Washington reprises his indelible role as Robert McCall, reviving a character that bears the distinct aura of a modern-day Western hero. As the narrative unfurls, it becomes evident that McCall, portrayed with a magnetic and enigmatic presence by Washington, encapsulates the quintessential spirit of a lone gunslinger embarking on an odyssey of justice.The film's journey commences with a narrative template well-worn but remarkably rejuvenated by Washington's performance. McCall's character, cloaked in a shroud of mystery and resolute determination, evokes the timeless archetype of a solitary figure traversing an unforgiving landscape.The cinematic experience is punctuated by action sequences that, while occasionally stretching the bounds of reality, serve as a poignant homage to the classic Western showdowns of yesteryears. These moments magnificently showcase McCall's astute resourcefulness, contrasting his unique brand of vigilante justice with the ruthless tactics of his adversaries. Denzel Washington, in these electrifying encounters, reasserts his status as one of Hollywood's most captivating talents.\"The Equalizer 3\" transcends mere action spectacle, delving into a labyrinthine narrative featuring the CIA, ISIS, and the Camorra. This intricate tapestry weaves together elements of espionage, terrorism, and organized crime, lending the plot an enthralling complexity. The introduction of Dakota Fanning's character as a CIA agent introduces a captivating dynamic, albeit one that could have benefited from further character depth and development.Under the masterful direction of Antoine Fuqua, the film's visuals seamlessly capture the picturesque Italian backdrop, invoking an aura akin to a modern-day frontier. The visual palette oscillates gracefully between tranquil townscapes and explosive showdowns in the dust-laden streets.Though minor tonal inconsistencies occasionally mar the film's coherence, \"The Equalizer 3\" ultimately emerges as a gripping and action-packed odyssey that adeptly channels the essence of a modern Western. Denzel Washington's enduring charisma and his arresting portrayal of McCall constitute the nucleus of this cinematic tour de force.In summation, \"The Equalizer 3\" delivers a cinematic symphony, splendidly resonating with the spirit of a contemporary Western saga. With its relentless action sequences and the charismatic resurgence of Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, it earns a commendable 8/10 rating. This film secures its place within the annals of modern action cinema while also reaffirming its lead actor's magnetic hold on the silver screen.",
    "132": "It occurred to me, whilst watching this,? End of the trilogy, film that the Mafiaso/Cammora characters here are really repugnant, nasty ,vicious individuals -sucking off the blood and sweat of the ordinary working person for 'protection ' money which never really has been addressed in either The Godfather films or Goodfellas.And yet this is how all the 'Corleones' made their fortunes.It was, to a certain degree ,in The Sopranos...\nThis adds a certain depth to the villians in The Equalizer 3, that one feels a certain elation during the fight scenes. Something that Indy Jones and M. I never had.....even the head Cammora villian looks like the smug,arrogant hospital male Matron Matthew Loga....surely a ripe villian for the taking!Denzil Washington is his usual charming, decent self and his neat,orderly fastidiousness (certainly with dunking his tea bags) reminds me of my friend Chris!It looks good- showing Sicilly with all its \" ciao Mama Mia\" stereotypes-,with well directed action scenes and whilst the romantic sub plot with a cafe owner is poorly written, it has heart,soul and pace.A worthy finale to an enjoyable trilogy.",
    "133": "Its very hard not to like Denzel (Washington) in any of his films over the years because, he is a superb actor who has great screen presence. Whereas the first 2 films were straight to the point, with a faster pace and some nice extra touches (like the emphasis of looking at his watch to evaluate killing time) this 3rd outing is, very laid back with a slower pace that matches the lifestyle pace of a place like Italy; especially in the islands. Its all done with an abundance of really cool style wrapped around a very good script. His payback to the thugs is done in a thinking, planned perfection (most likely the reason that the films critical dissenters did not like as it wasn't just wham, bang and dead). It was literally a cool, memorable and stylishly clever way to end on a good trilogy final note. Oh yes! He kills a ton of Mafia scumbags as well so, there is still a lot of Denzil's original villain disposing action sequences. And its all done amidst some of the finest scenery you will ever get to see in a film!I will miss this series of McCall Equalizer payback films.",
    "134": "As a fan of the series, I enjoyed it tremendously. While watching the movie lying down, I moved to a sitting position out of respect for McCall. My admiration for Denzel Washington reached its peak with the series. As they said they were going to force McCall in every movie, he took down the bad guys so easily, I swear I was filled with joy.And how beautiful the music in the finale was. It made me sad for an ending. However, I eagerly waited for the final music of the first movie, but it did not play. When the movie ended, I was sad that I would never have such a pleasant wait again.It is the 3rd and last movie of the series, produced in 2023. This time the movie takes place in Italy. Mccall came here again for some business and was shot by an accidental bullet. A person who finds him brings him to a doctor in a small town. During his recovery, Mccall sees the gang that haunts the town and begins to fight with his own methods.",
    "135": "There is nothing in it , except Washington. This is the worst movie. It has too much lengthy and meaningless shots that gives tour of Italian city,\nThere is not much action and its very limited.There is not real story and most conversation is also lengthy and meaning less.No character development as well.This is a very disappointing sequel\nDon't waste your time and money.Better watch something else or spend money on something else.People will watch this just because of Washington and name of sequel number 3 to successful franchise.I belive that is it, this is end of this franchise\nDenzel has great potential and I hope in future we see more acting like \"Training Day\"",

    "137": "Favorite episode from the old TV show was when the this guy beats his wife and kid and to teach him the error of beating up people the Equalizer rips the guy to a bloody pulp. Lesson learned, it's bad to use your fists, except, you know, when it's okay.Credit to this film, it doesn't even pretend to be as high minded. Violence is pretty much the only solution in this picture and the movie shows plenty of it. And like the old Edward Woodward show, you won't mind much because the bad guys are 100%, grade A cartoons. Plus, it's Denzel doing the ass kicking and he's always a joy to watch, even when he displays what can only be described as the ability to become invisible.No, its not a super hero movie but the ability to become invisible must be one of the Equalizer's talents because the guy sure gets in and out of places without anyone seeing him. Or seeing him too late.Look, it's a stupid movie. You want the better angels of our nature go find Denzel's performance in The Tragedy of Macbeth. That's art. This is fun, garbage for the teenagers and those adults who know better but don't care.",
    "138": "My ratings for the first two 'Equalizer' films were 9/10 and then a drastic fall down to 6/10. I really enjoyed the first, but the second one I did not find the same connection with. This third entry in the series falls somewhere in-between those two. It was far from perfect, but it did enough to scrape its way to the finish line in one piece.The film has a pretty good opening scene. It was unexpected and unique, and set things up nicely. Then the film falls into a bit of a rut for the next hour or so. There are surprisingly few action sequences in this film. The ones that there are are great, but I certainly could've used more of them.The film has a good menacing villain, but much like the action sequences, it feels like we don't get enough time with him. The film unfortunately spends a lot of the runtime on the least interesting elements.What carries the film though is this character of 'The Equalizer'. He is undoubtedly very cool and lot of fun to watch when he is operating on screen. Sometimes things do all feel about too easy for him, but hey, we aren't coming to these movies for shocks and surprises in the script are we? We know what we are sitting down for and that's what we get. 7/10.",
    "139": "No pun intended obviously. I assume you have seen the other two Equalizer movies. Maybe you do not have to watch them - as in this works as a standalone too. But especially the first one is one you should watch - still edges this in being the best. So much so, that back when it came out I was on \"Team Equalizer\" (against Team John Wick) ... I know, no one asked for that - at least officially.But some people were wondering who is better ... as much as I love Denzel Washington (let's keep it real, he is the better actor of the two), John Wick does not just have a movie more (both having TV shows, though Equalizer is not supposed to be any good, from what I've heard) ... but it is the better franchise! No denying that - and while the inferior second movie is almost forgotten with the final (?) entry in the franchise ... it is not erased. It is there - I quite liked that one too, but it did not hold a candle to the other movies.All that said, there was a lot of ... well people were telling me how brutal this one is. Maybe I have become used to it (movie violence that is), but while this does have a few really hardcore spikes ... when it comes to brutality, I was not ... shook (that's what people say nowadays, right?). There are also enough slower passages for us to relax and prepare ourselves for the next burst of action ... we know it is coming.The ending is a bit ... it feels almost rushed and yet it makes the most sense. Which also is true for the final ... reveal/twist. It was there all along ... kids, right?",
    "140": "Im one of those many who can't seem to find a decent action thriller nowadays and I was so skeptic going into this one especially after the total let down of Equaliser 2.. First part was excellent for me and will remain this way but part 3 doesn't fall too short behind infact some people could find it the best of all 3 subject to taste and different opinions but for whatever it is it got me writing a review on imdb which I very rarely do but I feel obliged doing so after really enjoying it in cinema and as I said the rarity of quality movies in this genre over probably the part 3 years as if Hollywood has gotten of all sudden brain dead with so many so called \"blockbusters\" flopping one after another in such a despicable way that has put off me off going to the theatre all togather.. This is one without giving anything away is a very well done well thought after movie that I believe could go in the classic books with the excellent choice of story, locations and overall directing which will make it standout to any serious viewer with proper taste... If anything you should take from brief comment it's to go and watch it without much expectation for too much expectation will always let you down!I gave this movie 9 yet its more of an 8 especially in comparison to movies coming out in its genre nowadays... it surley is not a 6-7 I tell you that much.. Reason I rate it so highly is to improve it's overall rating and hope others understand this point and be more generous with the rating towards decent films for as I said there is hardly anything decent in this extremely important genre nowdays.",
    "141": "Which isn't a bad thing from the studio's perspective: it means that they have little to no excuses to make many more Equalizer movies. However, unlike Fast and Furious, where one cannot even count the movies anymore, The Equalizer 3 actually is marketed as the 'final chapter'. I say actually because the audiences probably won't notice that this is the final instalment in Robert McCall's story or at least what resembles a story of some sort. This lack of grand-scale storytelling over multiple films is partly due to the first two films on which this film is based on, but that doesn't excuse the film's own narrative problems and its inability to develop our main protagonist and his history from the first two films.Don't get me wrong: The Equalizer 3 is not a terrible film. It certainly improves on certain aspects of The Equalizer 2 and has qualities of its own. Unlike the second Equalizer film, Robert McCall, played by the always reliable and charismatic Denzel Washington, isn't going around the world saving and helping random people. In Contrast, he is much more grounded in a local community, very much like the first film but now in Italy. This gives the story more depth and focuses the plot, even though this advantage over the second film is not fully utilized which I'll explain later. Furthermore, the accompanying cinematography of the locations in Italy is what you expect from a movie of this calibre. The action scenes are also well shot, and mixed with some creativity and symbolism make them well worth the wait in this otherwise slow-paced action film. The accompanying actors all do what they have to do, with a standout turn from Dakote Fanning. On a sidenote, it is nice that actual Italian actors are cast and also speak Italian, in comparison to many Hollywood blockbusters where we have to endure over the top accents in the English language.However, even when these good components are brought together, the story somehow falls flat. In general, the movie is basically about our one-man army Denzel Washington fighting the Italian mafia due to their aggression towards the local people who saved him and gave him peace. Along the way, a bigger connection is formed with international drug trafficking which is where the CIA gets involved and discovers secrets of the Italian mafia Denzel is fighting against as well as secrets of Denzel himself. However, how exactly this connection with drug trafficking was established in the movie is still vague to me after having seen it.Unfortunately, the film has many of these plot points that are shoehorned into the story without much explanation nor elaboration. Although no plot holes are present in this movie, these type of plot points that try to expand the scope of the story fall flat. Not because they do not make sense, but because they do not move forward themes and ideas that are interesting, especially in relation to our main characters. That a mafia clan is bigger than we thought does not really surprise an audience in an action film. I won't reveal spoilers here, but the surprising reveal in the end on the character played by Dakote Fanning that somehow connects this film to the previous two is also disappointing because it is not developed nor played on much in the film, just like the mafia reveal. This is disappointing considering the on-screen chemistry between Denzel and Dakote Fanning.Overall, the story suffers from superficiality. The film is supposed to be about Denzel's character homecoming, him finally 'finding peace'. However, that is difficult to believe. Although much time is dedicated to building a sense of relation for Denzel's character to the local people, it still feels rather superficial in the end because there are no stand-out, well-developed side-characters who reveal something interesting about Denzel's character, let alone his history. He may well be integrated into the daily life of the small Italian town in which almost the entire film takes place, but it doesn't feel like there is a strong bond between the various inhabitants of the town and Denzel's character. Sure, the previous movies didn't flesh out the man's motivations and past, but if there was anytime to do it, it would be now in this third and supposedly last film. At least that is what viewers of the previous two films like me hoped for.This slow build-up that is present in the first half of the film is also undone by the action that follows it. When Denzel and the movie do finally get to business with the Italian mafia, Robert McCall's motivations are even more questioned since he pro-actively goes out to hunt down the members instead of more justifiably attacking them at home when he or his loved ones are threatened. Another home-alone like stand-off sequence as in the first two films would have maybe felt repetitive, but it feels weird to crack down on the mafia this hard with all the violence (this movie is not for the faint-hearted) included when little to no inhabitants of the town have actually been seriously threatened, let alone killed.Even more so, Denzel's character is not even attacked in a way that makes the audience scared of what's to come for him, unlike the first two films where friends were kidnapped, tortured, or even murdered. I guess the equalizer's job is to equalize natural enemies of the people as quickly and efficiently as possible, but it doesn't make for compelling storytelling when our main character does not go through much personal struggle nor physical pain to achieve it. In other words, Robert McCall is kind of too perfect an assassin to be actually believable. The same mistake was made in the second film, and although it looked like this film was steering off of it by injuring Denzel badly in the beginning, his recovery in the end reveals that the filmmakers haven't learned their lesson. It would have been a great opportunity to see him struggle after having to recover and being injured for so long, but his terminator-like skills just reappear without a problem.This makes the killing, although creative and gruesome in a stylistic way, muted since there is little to no danger or actual surprise. As a result, when Robert McCall's duty is over at the end of the film, it comes as a surprise because it feels like the typical processes that a protagonist should normally go through in a film in order for the audience to believe him or her are missing. In a time where films are becoming longer and longer, The Equalizer 3 could have used a longer runtime to implement the necessary scenes for both the story and our main character to be more compelling. Instead, clocking in at 1h49, the film is more style than substance. In this case, the style is greatly executed but given the fact that the action is more sporadic in this film than you would expect, the shallow story is hard to ignore. Both Denzel and the audience deserved better, especially since there was so much potential here.In the end, I would rate this film a 5.5: better than the second film thanks to the recycling of plot strategies of the first film but falling short due to similar mistakes of the second film. Thus, I would recommend to watch this film when it is on sale or released on your preferred home-entertainment platform instead of going to the cinemas for it. Not a bad watch, but certainly not as good as some say.",
    "142": "I don't know how hollywood keep messing things up with sequels and prequels. I guess they are doing these just to get that 1 or 2 weeks of ticket sales and hope for luck.You'd know the younger the generations would be spending money the moment they see the Equalizer title.Denzel should stop making himself looking like a clown for the legend he is.Same old same old, I would forgive part 2 since that one had a much more direct motive for his buffet killings. It was bad nonetheless.This is just unforgivable. Over dramatic unnecessary scenes, random motives, pointless plot, same killings, the corkscrew was the victim again. I guess it become some kind of his trademark move. Its just plain bad.The only positive thing about this one was Dakota Fanning all grown up and beautiful. Give her better roles please, I believe she can deliver.",
    "143": "It's enjoyable...\nthe art and therapy of violence.It's a well put together story that offers the viewer an outlet for all of their existential angst...seems to be a lot of that going around today and movies like this help the viewer feel like they don't have to give vent to all that pent up feeling that life, as we've known it, is coming to an end. Hence, the therapy part of the second line...\ni liked the setup. The editing was clever. I can't say how or it would be a spoiler. But you'll understand if you see it.The low ratings are a joke. Probably by guys who went to see it with their girlfriends. And when their girlfriends got either angry that they had been taken to such a violent movie...or did nothing but talk about how attractive Denzel is, all the way home, well...you can see why they rated it so low.And, of course, denzel's got this character DOWN! Just like most other characters he's inhabited...\nso sit yourself down in the bloodbath and exit cleansed of your feelings that the bad guys never get their's...edit: and KUDOS to the composer of the OST...there's this part of when some of the violence happens...it's like the instruments are SCREEching! It got into my cells...i'm a musician that can play a number of instruments...have done recording and listened to more music than most 20 people would in a lifetime... and i can't quite figure out which instruments were used to attain that sound...it MIGHT just be some synth patch, but...in any case, it's VERY effective.",
    "144": "The Equalizer 3 (2013), directed by Antoine Fuqua, starring Denzel Washington reprising his unstoppable vigilante role in the two earlier Equalizer films, offers excellent production values, credible performances, and an enjoyable viewing experience.The tone is a bit uneven. It begins with a sort of mysterious, suspenseful sequence, then grinds to a tedious pace somewhat reminiscent of scenes from Denzel's Man on Fire, then picks up the pace, although in a largely predictable formulaic manner.At 68, Denzel is a little slow and a bit heavy for the role, but is benefited from a quick-cut editing style. At 29, Dakota Fanning seems to have passed her window of opportunity for her role by several years and a few kilos. The other performances, largely by unfamiliar actors, are spot-on and credible, although a bit two-dimensional.The tepid B-story romance falls flat. The film is rated R for violence, but the love story seems better suited to a high-school stage play. Two loose ends seem distracting: the MacGuffin from the opening scene, and a potentially intriguing revenge angle involving a character who fired a .22 bullet. Overall, it could have benefitted from less attention devoted to the picturesque scenery and more effort at character development. Other than miscasting Fanning and the obligatory interracial love interest, the film thankfully avoids woke themes.",
    "145": "I just watched the 3rd one instalment of the Equalizer series and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The pacing was excellent and the characters were all well introduced. The bad guys weren't likeable at all and perhaps that's what prevented me from giving it a full 10 out of 10 score. I thought the story should have spent an extra 10 minutes or so to flesh out the bad guys, maybe something like their upbringing or background of their family. Make them just a little bit more 3d and not so 2d in the story.Denzel's character McCall is a superhero, simple as that, though one without any bullet proof skin or ability to fly. I suspended any disbelief to thoroughly enjoy myself since he's the most believable superhero possible. Robert (or his Italian name Roberto) McCall is a great superhero hero we really want to see in real life, calm, cool and knows everything there is to know about swiftly dispatching the bad guys using just his Flash-like speed and medical doctor knowledge of every square inch of the human body.It does seem like it's the final outing of Denzel or McCall as the protagonist but? I suspect the story seems to suggest the next episode is one where he returns as a guru to a protege. The setting could well be the same location in charming southern Italy where McCall seems very much at home.",
    "146": "Just came back from the movie theaters; i loved it. The equalizer 3 has a subtle approach. The pace is not very fast but it never gets doll. Instead, you will floath allong with the main character Robert McCall (Played by Denzel Washington) in a lovely italian small city. The setting of this Italian small city is fantastic. You can feel the Italian vibe, the cozyness, the warmth and the simpleness of life where the whole village is one family.Maybe because i also have watched the other two parts and Robert McCall is for me a knowable character; i didnt mind the slow build-up before some action arrived. Instead you get to see more of the other side of his character which is great otherwise it would have been more a repeat of the first two parts. In this way you are more ''grabbed'' by the filmmakers and feel more connected with the ending of this trilogy. Because i dont know about you guys, but i left the movie theater with a smile after the last scene. I cant remember much movie trilogies with a ending thats feels so satisfying like the Equalizer 3 gave me.The action (there is still plenty of it) is good. It felt a little bit like John Wick but somehow also not. I love action shooters movie but believe the film makers did the right thing by not implenting to much over the top violence and shootings. In my eyes it would have disrubted the balance of the movie. Now.. the balance is just perfect and the main focus stays on the story line.Last but not least; i even laughed sometimes during the movie. But maybe not everyone will catch the same vibe as i did. In the end a solid 8 out of 10.",
    "147": "Saw it today. Frankly I must be old school. Not old hat; old school. Because I enjoy good scripts and characters I can either identify with or feel empathy for.I'm not part of the short attention span generation who requires explosions and mindless violence that doesn't give you time to take a breath (John Wick) or where the screen is loaded with so much tech and gimmickry (Transformers) or the foul language masquerades anger for toughness (nearly everything) so I can feel totally entertained with this one. A good script, sensational photography which is incidentally why the pacing of the film works. The town is amazing. The people are delightful. The bad guys are horrific and doctor Enzo steals our heart.There's enough of McCall's trademark to satisfy. Wow.An awesome piece. A great way to wrap the series.",
    "148": "3 out of 5 stars.The Equalizer 3 is a fair vigilante action thriller which Denzel Washington delivers his action role and a direction by Antoine Fuqua which feels like a formula sequel.The plot is good. Taking its setting in Italy this time with Robert (Denzel Washington) laying low and living with the people in a small town. Until they are being harrassed by italian mobster. Which he starts taking matters into his own hands. While the US government lead by Dakota Fanning is on Roberts trail.Plot is decent. Feels like an episodic thin story for the franchise. An italian mobster harrassing people for money and they are menacing the town by taking it over.Denzel Washington delivers the role and is always worth the watch with these films. Dakota Fanning is also a new addition which has some connections to Roberts past. While the rest of the cast ensemble is okay and the bad guys are forgettable.The action sequences is okay and gritty with its opening sequence. The action does fall thin in the climax.Overall, it is an okay film with a great lead and decent direction but falls short with its action and decent plot.",
    "149": "Seriously, if you decide to see 'Equalizer 3' you already know the sort of film, the sort of story, the sort of action you're in for. Hamlet, it isn't. Oscars it ain't gonna win. Subtlety is nowhere to be found. So, the question is,Given all that, will you be disappointed?I was, sort of.This McCall (Denzel Washington) seems somehow unrelated to the McCall of the earlier two films. He's no longer 'the regular guy' with a secret who just happens to work at Home Depot. No. It's as though he's been looking for trouble, and as the film opens he's found it. Or it found him. But here's the problem. He is so good at what he does (killing), and what he says (telling his victims what's going to happen to them and when) that when the fighting starts we know that nothing can happen to him. And so whatever suspense there might once have been, it's no longer there.But there's good to be had.(1) This Equalizer is shot in Italy (likely The Amalfi Coast) and it's great to look at. Its beauty makes for an ironic counterbalance to the violence that takes place.(2) Like in 'The Magnificent Seven' what we have here is a village being controlled by a band of hoodlums. Did I hear 'Mafia'? Could be. And so the stranger in town is faced with either walking away or helping the helpless in their battle against crime.(3) The bad guys are really bad. Unfortunately the worst of the bad guys gets off'd too early (for my taste).(4) There's a question raised early in the film. Is McCall a good man or a bad man. And when he's asked, McCall answers, I don't know. And after viewing the film in its entirety, I'm not altogether sure.Anyway, You know what you're in for. So, go and enjoy."
