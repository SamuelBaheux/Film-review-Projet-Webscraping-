    "0": "Defnitely not a bad movie for sure, but one which has an odd feature that might annoy or put off some folks...The bad: beware this movie is one contineous MONOLOGUE by Michael Fassbender, contineously speaking to himself in his head (silently) about HOW he is planning AND executing his killing sprees. We as viewers get to LISTEN CONSTANTLY to the thoughts of this meticulous and ruthless professional killer, who is on a revenge killing spree after his wife got molested by his very crime boss whom he worked for.The monologue is THE movie. Not kiddin'. There is little to NO diaologue or interaction between any other characters. It's solely focussed on Michael Fassbender's thoughts as a character and those thoughts unfortunately werent the most interesting. Not terrible, but not elevating me either....Something else DID disappoint me more though...More bad: I was waiting for SOME surprising and original twist or plot turn, that would make this story stand out from any other crime movie, which unfortunately never came. Bummer. There isnt a satisfying final to this story. On the contrary the final is a bit underwhelming. There definitely is a lack of true drama and thrill towards the end.The good: It has got several beautiful features though, like this bleak and dark lit photography, a sparse yet very effective hypnotizing soundscore and several great actors performing well (yet not extraordinary well). And the suspense and violence is almost hypnotic like, really mesmirizing.Despite this definitely being another quality made crime movie, it is not one of director David Fincher's best. Still worth a watch though, but I only would dare recommmend this to the arthouse movie fans of this killer crime genre.",
    "1": "Was really looking forward to this movie as i like Michael Fassbender and David Fincher and they never showed it at any cinemas near me during its limited release. Maybe i've just built it up too much in my head but i can't help but be disappointed in it.It has alot of cool style and it as dark as you'd expect from Fincher. Who as you'd imagine, does a good job of directing. But its a very straightforward story and i couldn't help but say \"Would a professional hitman really do that?\" at certain points of it.The constant commentary of the movie won't be for everyone and there's only so much dramatic acting Fassbender can do as a stealthy killer. So all in all. Pretty average.",
    "2": "That's a quote from the opening scene of the movie. I'll give them credit for telling you upfront: you are in for an absolute slog of a movie. It's not hyperbole for me to tell you this is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. It was extremely difficult to get through. I thought about quitting multiple times.To make it worse, the story is ultra basic and fully bland. There is zero intrigue. It failed at making me care about anything or anyone in the movie. There is one really cool fight scene that lasts a couple minutes. Other than that, nothing about this movie stands out.The quality level of filmmaking is far from terrible. But it's swept aside by the sheer boredom that is this movie. I really wish Netflix could figure out how to make movies. I feel like it has to be the writing. Or maybe they just take on scripts that aren't worth making. Way to waste Fassbender.",
    "3": "I'm surprised by all the positive reviews here. If you like movies that are stylistic and pretty in theory, but boring and consulates in practice, I guess you'll like this movie. But if you're someone who actually cares about plot, I'd definitely pass.For starters, this movie takes forever to get to the point. It starts off with narration that just continues and continues. If you make it past the dull start, you'll discover an unoriginal plot that's just not interesting enough to justify its unnecessary complexity. There are a few stand out moments, but they're strung together poorly. There's also nothing to get you invested in the characters or their well-being. You're just watching a guy do stuff, and sometimes it's interesting, but a lot of the times it's not.",
    "4": "3.5 ⭐\nI love Finchers work but this one was a bit off. This film had a typical revenge story with a lackluster ending. Fassbender lead the way only to discover the script limited his potential for a great performance. The whole film was just sitting and waiting for the peak to hit but it never does.Cinematography was nothing out of the ordinary. Production was decent but it didnt seem difficult at all given how the film played out. Dont think any awards will be dished out for this one..A watch and forget movie with no lasting impressions from the audience. Probably why Fincher chose Netflix. Its free to watch for a script he pulled from the middle rack.I wouldnt recommend this film to anyone trying to save 2 hours of their night.",
    "5": "It's well compiled. The narration got me invested. Shot beautifully, the suspenseful music is excellent. The movie as a whole is...yeah it's fine? It lacks depth and some scenes lack logic as well. It makes for a fun watch nevertheless. Better than most of the stuff going around these days. A one time watch and you never think about it again kind of a watch. Not Fincher's best but not his worst either. Fassbender is decent in his role portrayed as a mysterious killer who has a knack for everything pretty much. Solid punches to the face by a guy twice his size does not faze him at all. That's about it really.",
    "6": "The Killer simply gives you no reason to be invested in it, rather empty, uneventful and dull for the runtime.It's nothing you haven't seen before either and without substance, considering those involved, though not awful or anything. The soundtrack however is awful, given it isn't satire like \"American Psycho.\" The fight scene's like a video game, skill and cunning's hardly overcoming that sort of velocity of power. Take the UFC battle between Frank Mir and Brock Lesnar as a basic example. I mean the sequence's probably still the highlight of the film, I just didn't buy it. All up a pretty pointless film.",
    "7": "The Killer (Michael Fassbender) is a paid assassin. In Paris he misses his mark (Endre Hules) and kills a dominatrix (Monique Ganderton) instead. He now becomes a mark himself. He arrives late at home to discover his girlfriend in a hospital. He goes on a revenge tour.The film consists of Fassbender talking in a monotone in his head. It is boring as he keeps giving himself the same rules and affirmations over and over. There is an element of humor in his various alias based on fictional characters in 1970's TV shows. I caught, Felix Unger, Oscar Madison, Howard Cunningham, Reuben Kincaid, Sam Malone, George Jefferson, Lou Grant, and Robert Hartley (Bob Newhart Show). That was the fun aspect and WWJWBD.Too boring for my tastes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",
    "8": "The Killer with no name in David Fincher's passion project of twenty years, \"The Killer,\" is a man of too many words and encyclopedic knowledge of nothing useful. Played by Michael Fassbender in a single note--A5, I think--he's accumulated lots of frequent-flier points, traveling across continents like some kind of amoral anchorite. The best that can be said about Fincher's passion in this project is that it's over in under two hours.Unhappily, on the way to its most probable conclusion, one must sit through Fassbender's blubbering stream of consciousness. Mistakenly labeled \"noir,\" apparently because Fincher has acquired expertise in this style, the narrative commits to its purpose as the Killer does his, mostly with obligatory voice-over narration, a filmmaker's last recourse to fill dead air.After all, a script with comic-book characters and a predictable plot needs some justification, since assassins skilled at efficient murdering rather than small talk, like those Charles Bronson pulled off effortlessly without self-analysis, offer writers fewer turns at displaying witty observations about German tourists and street mimes. And as assassins go, this one can't seem to get anything right: first missing his target, then--stepping out of an L. L. Bean catalog amidst basic-black Parisians--lurching his way to find \"the Client\" who hired him, who's retaliated, he thinks, by attacking his girlfriend. Take note: giving him a girlfriend is how a writer humanizes a killer, in accordance with \"A Screenwriter's Guide in 10 Easy Steps.\"More stuck-up than cold-blooded, Fassbender never rises above the two-dimensional creation he's portraying. But he mustn't feel bad. He's in good company along with assorted clerks, waiters, ticket agents, taxi drivers, and stock players straight from central casting: the Lawyer, the Client, the Brute, and the Expert, expertly played by the book by a pallid and over-exposed image of Tilda Swinton, the Actor.",
    "9": "The point of this movie? I have no idea. I watched it because of Fincher, and though I had an increasing urge to switch off, I kept watching because of Fincher, expecting something might happen. I don't mean action, or some twist, or even a proper ending. Just something other than complete cliche. A bit of juvenile philosophical rambling. Dislikeable characters. No tension. No drama. A bit of dominatrix titillation at the start, with, predictably, the sexual woman being the one who ends up dead. Do we need another movie about a psychopathic, emotionless hitman? I'm seriously reconsidering Fincher's status as an auteur. Boring. Bland. A real disappointment.",
    "10": "Michael Fassbender is a first-rate actor. It's always good to see him on screen. But even he can't save this one. I guess the point might be to get us to appreciate the dissonance between The Killer's philosophical voice-overs and the numerous obstacles that he has to overcome to even get close to the position that philosophy outlines, but even as played by Fassbender, with all his charisma, his skill, his sheer sexiness, the guy is such a bore I kept urging the credits to roll. There are a couple of excellent scenes -- a protracted fight between Fassbender's Killer and Sala Baker's Brute; a sort of bravura act-off between Fassbender and Tilda Swinton -- and a couple of notable supporting performances from Kerry O'Malley and Charles Parnell. But on the whole, I felt the whole enterprise was a waste of time, talent and money.",
    "11": "The brilliant acting of Michael Fassbender and the work of director David Fincher create an atmosphere of constant tension, also with camera angles, lighting and all those things. But be careful. Do not consider the narrator's and protagonist's chatter throughout the film as the words of a wise man. What you are listening to are the thoughts of a psychopath. Such human beings consider themselves to be the centre of the universe and who know exactly what's right and wrong. Everything they do is the right thing. About 2% of all men are psychopaths. Just a few examples of how wrong he is:Within the first 15 minutes, he chatters about1. DNA in the 21st century and his way of leaving no DNA behind.But the fact is that there is no way to avoid DNA residue nowadays if the person is in a room for more than 20 minutes. And he even spent a few days in the same room.2. He mentions survival of the fittest while being a professional killer who kills anyone for money, no matter how that person fits into the environment. So he does exactly the opposite of what he is preaching about.3. He explains the importance of his rules, such as: Have no empathy. Do not trust anyone. Always stay focused. Don't improvise. Never miss a given chance. But he listens to music on earphones during a sniper shot that he has been waiting for several days. And misses the target. Listening to music not only keeps the mind from wandering, it keeps the mind from staying focussed as well.He shows characteristic signs of psychopathy in the scene with Tilda Swinton at the table inside the restaurant. (The following description is not me describing him in that scene. It is a textbook version of the\n'psychopathic stare' ): A wide-eyed stare, with more of the white of the eye showing, with reduced blinking, dilated pupils, and eye contact or 'fixation' held for longer. A focus that feels predatory or threatening. That's precisely what he does when he sits at the table with her.By the way, what she is telling him inside the restaurant is what the real plot of the movie is: he tries to fix his bruised ego and she is right about that. He is not on revenge because his wife was attacked. Persons like him can't really love anyone other than themselves. He doesn't caress her, kiss her or show any other sign of real love.Nobody said this movie was about a perfect killer or hero. Fincher created a portrait of a killer who is a psychopath without any conscience. And the viewer is invited to watch him at work.A movie in the manner of David Fincher - unique and misinterpreted by many people.",
    "12": "Style over substance, as one of the reviewers pointed out, nails it. Besides being rather boring and predictable, this movie does not entice any emotions. For me, feeling for a movie character is very important, but in this flick I did not have an empathy for anyone. The story itself and the characters in this movie are so cold, you should wear a jumper watching it. Some of the main reasons for making a movie: (i) creating a piece of art (comes from the heart of the director, e.g. Blade runner by Scott); (ii) making money by pushing right buttons in viewers' cognitive response panel (e.g. A. I. By Spielberg). Why was this movie made by Fincher is a mystery to me. You will miss nothing by not watching it.",
    "13": "Greetings again from the darkness. There is a reason I choose not to interview directors, writers, actors, or anyone else involved with the movies I watch and review. It's because I prefer to evaluate based on what we see on screen rather than whether it's the product of someone likable or not, quick witted or not, or passionate about their work or not. Anytime I start to waver on this approach, I'm quickly reminded why the decision was made. David Fincher is unquestionably one of the finest filmmakers working today. His work includes such films as SEVEN (1995), THE GAME (1997), FIGHT CLUB (1999), PANIC ROOM (2002), ZODIAC (2007), THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010), THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2011), GONE GIRL (2014), and MANK (2020). Despite this remarkable resume of successful films, each new one deserves to be judged on its own ... there is no extra credit for past brilliance.The all-too-brief and remarkably cool opening credit sequence sets the stage for a film that looks absolutely marvelous. This leads us to an extended opening sequence where we learn about our titular cold-blooded assassin played by Michael Fassbender. It's through his redundant narration that we learn about his meticulous and detail-oriented approach to a job that has made him a very wealthy man. He listens to various songs by The Smiths, does yoga in the dark, and repeats his mantras to keep himself centered and focused on the job at hand. After all, he cautions us that this job is only for those who can handle boredom - as if committing cold-blooded murder is somehow a more natural trait than handling down time on the job.Getting to know the quirks and nature of this hitman is actually the highlight of the movie, because he botches this job in the worst possible manner, and then must step outside his norm to handle this 'new' development. When he discovers that his partner has been seriously wounded as fallout for his blown job, the Killer conveniently drops his 'nothing personal' mantra and proceeds to pursue very personal revenge.SEVEN screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker has adapted the graphic novel written by Alexis Nolent and illustrated by Luc Jacamon, and Fincher is clearly having fun with the material. It's not accurate to call this a dark comedy, but there are some comedic elements included to lighten things up a bit. Most of these struck me as a bit lame: shots at our societal dependence on name brands (Amazon, WeWork, Starbucks, etc), the Killer's disguise as a 'German tourist', and the endless string of 1970's sitcom names used in his travels (think \"The Odd Couple\", \"Happy Days\", and even \"The Partridge Family\").To ensure no viewer is left behind, the film is divided into six chapters highlighted by the geographic location and the reason for being there: Paris - the Target, Dominican Republic - the hangout, New Orleans - the lawyer, Florida - the brute, New York - the expert, and Chicago - the client. Each of these chapters involves a piece of the revenge puzzle, and include fine actors Charles Parnell, Tilda Swinton, and Arliss Howard. Ms. Swinton's segment offers the most, but her presence is over much too soon. It's the mano-y-mano fight with the brute that is the weakest, since the fight is so over-the-top that neither would walk away ... yet Killer departs with only a scratch over his eye.While most of the story seems too familiar and kind of ludicrous, the film itself is a work of art. Fassbender perfectly captures the icy killer, and Oscar winning cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt (MANK, 2020) delivers in the multitude of locales, as well as the action shots. Two-time Oscar winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross handle the score of this film that will undoubtedly be regarded more highly by most other critics than by me, since a line like WWJWBD simply falls flat in my mind.Opens in theaters on October 27, 2023.",
    "14": "The first botched assassination was slow to set up and stupid. If your big plan is to find an apartment directly across the street from your target, and then assume the target never closes the curtains, you have a stupid plan. Then there remains the question of why he didn't take a second shot (even though the first shot may have gone through the hooker and hit the target. It's most likely a 50. Cal round that can go through both sides of a brick house).The music was annoying, or I should say the way the music was played in the loud-muffled gimmick. I just wanted it to stop. I can never listen to The Smiths again without thinking of this weak movie.Speaking of sound, I got so sick of him repeating his little life lessons that he took from Chicken Soup for the Psychopath.OMG, he kills a number of people, but he keeps a watchdog alive? First with some cockamamy sleeping potion, then he doesn't shoot the thing after he just blew a dude's brains out. This is typical Hollywood morality. John Wick kills over 400 humans, but he's nice to dogs so it's OK.The Killer rates a 1 on IMDb because Tilda Swinden tells a really old joke that everyone has heard...and she dragged it out. As she was telling it with all the embellishments a person with zero sense of humor often uses in telling jokes (also only for the humor-impaired) I was begging her to stop. It was embarrassing to watch.How could the director have such a hard-on for a comic book when the story is so thin and stupid? There wasn't much of a story. Revenge because his maid or someone got beat up (her status wasn't made clear until the end). This is a guy who murders people for a living. I guess you don't need to understand irony to be a hitman. He goes on and on about a need to remove empathy from your life skills, yet he does all this over a woman? Sorry, a complete lack of empathy means you can't pick and choose, you have no feelings for other humans, like Donald Trump, a guy who wouldn't miss a meal to save the life of a family member.The movie tries so hard to be slick and cool, and to make the killer out of be such a pro, but a lot of it is silly and amateurish. He throws a phone down on the sidewalk and steps on it, throws evidence away in the closest receptacle he can find, waits around in his car like a pervo as if no one will notice in a residential neighborhood. Someone comes to the door unexpectedly and he is ready with a sniper rifle? He doesn't have a sidearm for back-up? In close quarters, I'd rather have a cast iron skillet than an unwieldy rifle. He flees the botched hit on a moped but in such a panic that he attracts police attention far from the scene. This didn't add tension, it added dumb.The fight scene in Florida was horribly choreographed and took forever, besides the fact that it was so dark you could barely tell if they were fighting or dancing.The happily ever after ending was such a cop out, especially in this film that wanted so desperately to be noir. I was waiting for the piña colada song in the closing credits.",
    "15": "It had a really slow rhythm and I didn't think the script was rich at all. The one thing I wanted for David Fincher's film would be that it didn't have any significant differences from other films of the same genre, namely, that the story would focus on an assassin who is looking for revenge. So what? What new did it have to offer?Okay, this assassin was very sharp, focused, and meticulous, but what exactly did he do? Did he kill people like John Wick 2014? Or did he create that wonderful scene like Nobody 2021 in the bus? Or, for example, like Mechanic 2011, did he have new ideas for his attacks?There wasn't much to this movie except the director's name. I was really disappointed and hope this great director will do better in the future.",
    "16": "Clean, correct, simple story. Not knowing the graphic novel, I have not comparation term , but the blank story of an assasin, precise detail by detail, offering to Michael Fassbender good occasion to craft , in fair terms, a man constructed, like a puzzle, from details and the crowned desire of David Fincher to create the adaptation of novel are enough for appreciate The Killer.In essence, the realism is its virtue and it works just beautiful for seduce the audience with a story about a form of routine, not accesible to many from us, with fascinating sparkles.In short, a correct work , in each aspect.",
    "17": "An incompetent hitman is hired for a job we never get the reasoning forHe fumbles itThere are repurcussions for being incompetentFor some reason he has a woman who we don't know, don't get to know and have literally zero attachment to or information on stashed in his supposed \"safe house\"The woman gets in the way of said repurcussionsFassbender goes on a path of revenge about a character who we have zero reason to feel invested inHe inexplicably connects people together with nothing more than a code name he somehow gets their exact country, state and knows specifically which restaurants they eat atHe buys a fob toy from amazon which inexplicably gives him a magical key that opens any and all electronic locks, barriers, gym lockers, doors to high tech fancy apartments, you name it.He spends the entire movie regurgitating \"rules\" which not once does he abide by and 99% of the time those \"rules\" do not even apply to what is happening for example constantly talking about only doing what you are paid to do, while he spends the entire movie past the first 10 minutes doing things that are purely personal and nobody is paying forHe kills his way up the chain of the people holding him responsible for his incompetence, on the way does not hesitate to kill mutliple civilians like taxi drivers and secretaries but when he comes face to face with the person paying for Fassbender to face consequences for being the worst hitman ever, he reveals his intentions, reveals his identity, shows his face to multiple security cameras and then just walks away.So, what was the point in anything that we watched? A monumental idiot goes on a path of revenge over a relationship that gets less than 60 seconds of screen time, then with absolutely zero logic stops short of the final target and the credits roll. Saying that this movie has a poor story would be a compliment, because that would be inferring there is a story.",
    "18": "The main issue with \"The Killer\" is that it is a monologue driven movie with poor writing. The main character's inner monologue reminds me of a teenager who just read \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" for the first time. It is dull, inane, and obnoxious -- it feels like you're listening to someone who spends their entire life on Reddit but thinks they have something interesting to say.Everything outside of the poorly written monologue is solid, and Tilda Swinton's brief appearance breathes some life into the film. However this isn't enough to save a movie that almost entirely driven by the inner dialogue of a deeply uninteresting character (especially when the ending is so flaccid).",
    "19": "I don't understand why people give this movie 1-2 stars. It's not a great movie but how do you rate it so low when 90% of movies are much worse and have better ratings. It does start slow but then turns into a quite watchable and enjoyable action flick, with minor logical holes but a gem compared to movies that don't make sense at all.Sure; it will be a waste of time for many, but what do you expect, to be enlightened and see something amazing and original that no one ever suspected? How many of such movies are released every year?The Killer is simply a dose of decent entertainment when you do decide to waste some time and run out of amazing truly movies to watch.",
    "20": "The opening sequence sets the tone - dull, slow self-indulgent nonsense. It doesn't improve. Key points of the plot are missing, the main character's actions are left unexplained, and it gets nowhere, very very slowly. The constant voice-over should have been a warning, but my wife hates turning off movies. That's the only reason we got to the end.Audio is dreadful for the entire movie. Actors are ok, but sadly don't save this movie from itself. I had high hopes considering the director, but just doesn't work. Not sure how you take a good story and mess it up so badly.Save yourself the time. Life is too short to watch this movie.",
    "21": "There's an art to the profession that you pursue, requiring concentration, application and focus - to name a few, to achieve the end result, there's only you that you consult, going over your technique, by rote narration. Alas solutions do not always find conclusions, and stray bullets may just lead to more confusions, as the hand that feeds bites back, you're left with revengeful attack, that may leave one or two souls, with bad contusions. You nail home the message you believe is fair, tracking down the double crossers in their lairs, the antithesis of Leon, you won't be scotched by brutes who put on, and beware the landing that, leads to the stairs.Great to see Michael Fassbender back doing what he does best.",
    "22": "Michael Fassbender plays The Killer, an assassin for hire. He has many aliases and a mind coldly calculated to kill. He's doing his slow methodical process for his next job, but the shot goes wrong.This is based on the French graphic novel and directed by David Fincher. It's cold. Narration is not my favorite cinematic trope when it's done in this unfeeling fashion. It's meant to be his insightful interior monologue. Instead, his tone leaves me hypnotized and sleepy. I missed the taxi kill during my first watch. The movie does get me with some very compelling sections starting with the lawyer kill. The best scene has to be Tilda Swinton. That interaction is electric and I love the joke. I've heard a version of that joke before. The final interaction is somewhat unsatisfying. Fincher is a master filmmaker although a couple of choices left me cold.",
    "23": "I was looking forward to it. Everything about this film seemed perfect and it is nowhere near it. The only positive thing I can find bout it is the smiths music playing in the background. Micheal Fassbender acts as if he forgot the basic element of being an actor. I am literally feeling sleepy. There was no narrative let alone any action. I don't even know how fincher managed to show so little in two hours. It was as if this film pioneered a genre where movies are just boring waste of times. Don't watch this pile of garbage. Rather rewatch The game or fight club. Also it felt like fincher just wanted to be done with this.",
    "24": "A complete yawnfest. I persisted because I thought there has to be a pay off, some kind of twist, some kind of perhaps possible redemption. And because Netflix told me it was a 98% match for my film interest. But no. Bomb. Big.There is a stream of consciousness inner dialogue from the killer which borders on cliched repetitive boredom.It shows him artfully having hundreds of identities and credit cards in storage units all over the place. But never a clue as to how he acquired all this. He breaks into wherever he chooses, again we don't quite understand the methodology apart from him flashing access cards at everything.Tilda Swinton has a tiny part so that was a rip off also.Honestly, I don't know how this was made without some producer rolling on the floor thinking it was a huge joke.Michael Fassbender is always riveting but here he's an unconvincing robot riding in cars playing loud music, talking to himself and watching his pulse.Don't waste your time.1/10.",
    "25": "I can't believe I wasted almost 2 hours of my life. I really wanted to like it. Big David Fincher fan, but this movie is just pointless. The acting is good but there isn't any plot. I guess he wanted it to be like John Wick but it just doesn't work. It's boring and it's just not interesting at all.It feels as it could be the beggining of a movie but it just doesn't reach the third act. It's just boring and just done before. I feel nothing for the characters, you never sympathize, you don't care and I just don't understand why even make movies like this. I would not recommend.Hollywood really needs to pay writers, this is a prime example of lack of good writing.......",
    "26": "A very strange thing happened, while sipping on a coffee in the Curzon, waiting for the ads to finish, the venue was playing some rather good music, when a track came on I liked, I asked the staff was the track 'The Smiths' or 'Morrissey'? 'The Smiths' he replied. Ah cool, great track I said, then proceeded to the screen.So when the movie started I was a bit like wooaahh, of all the bands!Unfortunately that was the highlight of the evening.The film is a bit dull, feels like it's trying to create a Patrick Bateman type of character but fails abysmally.The soundtrack including the Trent Reznor score is superb, creates real tension which isn't sadly matched by the protagonist.He basically walks around at 2 miles per hour, gets in serious fights but walks, or should I say, runs away with 2 minor scratches, no aches, no broken bones.On the way out I asked the guy working if that was a special 'The Killer' playlist, to which he replied, nah, it was a random playlist!Spooky!",
    "27": "I love Fincher, Fassbender, The Smiths so why didn't I love this? It is incredibly stylish but is stylized almost to the point of being sterile. There just isn't enough depth in a very linear plot that has little or no surprise in it.And I would that a film that featured quite so many Smiths songs would be my dream movie but they just didn't fit the style of the rest of the film, felt wedged in. Fassbender gives a good performance but he didn't have to work too hard to be brooding and largely unresponsive to things going on around him. Tilda Swinton is great for the short time she's on screen. Overall, you just can't get away from the story just not being that interesting and no amount of style will make up for that.",
    "28": "Its been a while since I really enjoyed the french comic series from Matz and Luc Jacamon. The movie skips all the gkod parts, mostly about deep characters. In the movie they are all just shallow nobodys.Also ....what about the in your face product placements that are all over the film...( coffee, burgers, onlineorder, rentalcars...) It felt like watching advertisments over 90min with a boring TV movie between.On the postive side you can feel the director was A list, camera angles, cut etc. But the screenplay was lacking and from those 13 Comicbooks they used just snall parts and americanised them too much. Luc Besson would probable been the better Storyteller here...",
    "29": "David Fincher's contemporary thriller \"The Killer\" isn't cut from the same cliches as conventional B-movie hitman epics. This film is wired with the same offbeat vibe of a John Huston thriller. The events appear almost surreal during some moments, and then surprisingly violent at other times. The ending felt curiously anti-climactic, a letdown after the protagonist's Herculean labors set things right. Indeed, I wanted an ending with more bite. For example, \"The Killer\" lacks the ending of Michael Winner's \"The Mechanic\" (1969) with Charles Bronson. Quibbles aside, I enjoyed watching Fincher's straightforward, but suspenseful action-adventure opus. Moreover, I appreciated Finch's decision to share the protagonist's interior monologues with the spectator. Not only does this flesh out this ruthless predator's nature, but it also provides deeper insight into what makes this bastard tick! You won't feel inclined to identify with the eponymous gunman because he lacks charisma. Rarely does he laugh and display a genuine jovial sense of humor. Michael Fassbender is largely contemplative-obsessive might be a better description--as he recites a litany of rules and regs which would make a manual for assassins. Again, we hear his thoughts as he reminds himself to \"Anticipate, Don't Improvise.\" Interestingly, neither Fincher nor his writer Andrew Kevin Walker of \"Se7en\" identify their protagonist by name. When a character has no name, an aura of mystery emerges around him. At the same time, a character without a name amounts to an everyman. Literally, this assassin is everybody and nobody. Incidentally, Fincher & Walker adapted the graphic novel series 'The Killer' scripted by French writer Alexis Nolent and illustrated by Luc Jacamon. No, since I haven't read their novel, I cannot comment about the fidelity of the film to its source material.\"The Killer\" unfolds with the same clinical efficiency that its nameless protagonist wields from fade-in to fadeout. In Paris, France, an elite assassin bides his time for the fateful moment when he will pull the trigger on his quarry in a building situated across from his own some fifty yards away. Mind you, that's a rough estimate. When I watch \"The Killer\" again, I will scrutinize the distance more closely. Anyhow, the first act of Fincher's murderous but methodical melodrama introduces us to a cold-blooded assassin who knows his business inside and out. A painstaking professional, he waits patiently for the split-second to ice his victim. Meticulous might better describe his behavior. With \"The Killer,\" Fincher plunges int0 full-blown Michael Mann mode. This slick, somber, but serious crime yarn not only shuns comic relief but also shirks frilly romantic escapades. After impressing us with his vast knowledge of murder and the elements involved in getting away with murder, including a wristwatch that dictates the exact moment to fire based on a favorable blood pressure reading. This man has more money and guns than you can imagine! As far as hitman movies go, \"The Killer\" forges a whole new standard, and yet it reminded me of Jean-Pierre Melville's \"Le Samurai\" (1967), with Alain Delon. Incredibly, our killer misses the shot and suffers the consequences. Sloppy, you might say, but a lot like the British assassin in Fred Zinnemann's \"The Day of the Jackal\" (1973). The 'Jackal' is a hired British mercenary who lines General De Gaulle up in the crosshairs but misses! He didn't expect the General would lean to one side and kiss his French compatriot! Culture rears its ugly head here. The British assassin is handicapped by a culture he doesn't grasp. In \"The Killer,\" a prostitute in a fetching black outfit crosses in front of the target and suffers instant death from our protagonist's bullet. AS I mentioned earlier, this span of time covers Act One.Act Two chronicles our protagonist's efforts to cover his tracks and eliminate anybody who may be coming after him for missing the shot. Predictably, Fincher and his writer bring these two people face to face before Act Three. Act Two takes up the most time in this 118-minute pulse pounder. We get to admire our hero's sense of professionalism. He has myriad identities and loads of currency. The second act brings the action closer to him. He owns an estate in South America and the people who apparently hired him dispatch some thuggish types to ransack his estate and beat his woman to within an inch of her life. She is faithful to him and worried while in the hospital that she might inadvertently spew forth incriminating information about her lover. There are several visceral, close quarters combat scenes. Ultimately, the last of his challenging adversaries (played with grace and wit by Oscar-winning actress Tilda Swinton of \"Michael Clayton\") almost takes him down. Finally, Act Three shows our hero relaxing in a lawn chair to admire the weather in a ending that rewards more than punishes our amoral protagonist.",
    "30": "One of those where wasted time is never reclaimed. Just rubbish. Most seem to rate it higher simply because of the director, and try to dig out desperately anything positive and focus on that istead the fact the movie is terrible. No story, irritating main character with no backstory, nothing to attach to emotionally... You should be impressed by his meticulousness where lack there of gets him into trouble to begin with. Terrible overdubed dialogue throughout the movie, one of the worst i've seen. Especially the one in the taxi scene where it doesn't even match with what taxi driver is saying. Do yourself a favor, stay away.",
    "31": "This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Everything that happens is completely predictable. The killer doesn't act like a professional, but like a bloody novice - even after he has committed the crime. In the real world, he would have been found out after 10 minutes. The worst thing, however, is the very long and boring monologue at the beginning of the movie, which lasts more than 10 minutes and is completely superfluous.I strongly advise against watching this movie because not only will you be bored, but it's like being taken for a ride and then remembering that you fell for it. The movie just acts so smart and is so stupid and primitive.",
    "32": "For the first 20 minutes, the killer is staging for his kill and rambles on about something from Popeye to his strategies of anticipating, not improvising etc. 21st minute, he takes the killer shot and kills the wrong person! Lol! Then he has an apparent panic and paranoia attack. He is so miserably running from police sirens that you'd want to tell him to breathe, calm down and not break driving rules (duh!) or he will surely get caught. So much for him not giving a f$&@ to anything. 15 minutes and series of event later he is in hospital with his girlfriend who is seriously injured and almost in coma. The lady suddenly gets out of it and coherently rambles for next 10 minutes?? How? To director - have you ever taken an anesthesia in your life? Seriously, is this movie a spoof of something? Am i missing the point? A 1 hour and 22 minute movie and almost half of it already gone in wrong killings, panic attacks, and so so so much rambling. Where is direction? Where is the story? Who wrote these dialogues? Was editing ever a plan of this movie or you made the editing team sleep by your dialogues. Also, not a correct actor man. Overall a very lazy job by everyone.",
    "33": "I'll admit I never the read graphic novel is what this movie is based on. But I have to say, this was a pretty good thriller. Although it's focuses on Michael Fassbender's characters thought processes, the film never gets boring, it moves along very well.Michael Fassbender's character is not a good guy and not even an anti hero, he's a killer for hire, and very cunning and ruthless, although there are moments where he does show some mercy, but he is not a good guy. Even though you go along with him all the way. Tilda Swinton really shines here, for a small role she steals it quite well. There some good shootout scenes, and an awesome fight scene.",
    "34": "I can't decide if this movie was created out of spite, or by A. I.Lets start with the opening scene, our 'hero' uses a rifle with subsonic rounds to take out a fat bloke in Paris. Our 'expert' assassin mentions at the distance there will be no bullet drop, so I can assume it will be traveling at close to the speed of sound. Of course a Parisian prostitute stopped the bullet. Even in this world where women are made of Kevlar, a semi automatic rifle would have solved the issue. Again, he mentioned the close distance so no need for a bolt action.When stalking the Floridian, the main character says there should be a 30 day waiting period for creatine. I wonder how this would work... You go to the supermarket and order your chicken for next month? Sorry sir, due to your criminal conviction in 2008 I can't serve you this fillet of salmon. I think the writers may have meant steroids. But still dumb.The MC kills everyone without emotion but leaves the last guy alive for some reason. He literally killed a taxi driver because he saw his face, but the final guy is free to go.The part where he goes into the gym and mentions the bodyguard isn't Mossad irked me. How does he know? The guy could literally be checking his phone, do Mossad agents have magic Jewish telepathy that I'm unaware of so have no need for phones?The other assassins travel by private plane, which makes it easier to do shady stuff. The MC flies cattle class. Why?Back to the Floridian - He is an assassin who's only weapon is a nightstand Glock? I have known normal Floridians who have a firearm in ever room and one in their truck. Also, our emotionless killer can't shoot a dog for some reason.What is with the crazy amount of product placement.The gun seller says something like \"Damn my boy knows his way around a sub compact glock\" - This genuinely made me laugh. I can't imagine having the balls to insult someone like this to their face. Also the micro-phallic silencer was hilarious.Finally, after killing a few people, he is free to sit by his pool with his spicy Latina wife - so there are zero consequences for what he did? There were two rolodexes filled with people in that industry. None of them are going to come for him... at his house... where they know he lives.Like I said, I feel like this movie was made out of spite, trying to be a cerebral action thriller that is somehow dumber than the competition.",
    "35": "Usually the viewer has to figure out, how to perceive the character through his actions. In this movie you get a manual in form of pointless, repetitive narration that tells you what to think. Unfortunately in this case the words don't describe what's on the screen, which results in disbelief after only a few minutes.Let's break down the first scene. -The \"killer\" enters a building to assassinate someone across the street, not shortly before the target arrives, no he gets there days earlier! Why? Did someone give him a wrong date?He then parades in front of a big window, makes almost friends with a lady across the street. When it's dark, he sits there too and turns the light towards his face to be seen. When he gets bored, he assembles his rifle that makes noises like a rusty door hinge, but has no time to oil it.He makes yoga exercises too, brushes his teeth and has a small spray bottle to destroy all the DNA he leaves behind. For some reason he uses his mouth to put gloves on.He also has a special custom made electric table that elevates assassins in the room, so they can lean comfortably and don't have to stand. This guy is prepared!Occasionally someone enters his apartment, to throw in letters by surprise. Our well organized killer has then to run with a big rifle and hide behind the corner, ready to shoot. When the danger is over, he disassembles his rifle back into small pieces, shortly before his target arrives.He then has to rush and prepare the rifle in a hurry, after spending days in the room. He can only shoot accompanied by music with ear plugs, because he doesn't have to be aware of what happens around him.Eventually he hits the wrong person.For some strange reason he remembers to reload after a while, but then it's too late. He leaves the room in panic, to reach his getaway electric Vespa, carefully secured with a digital lock, not even he can open!Suddenly there is police everywhere, but he acts like he is the only person in Paris and drives like a madman on his electric bike throwing parts of his rifle in spectacular fashion. Wow!Then there is the length of this movie. 120 minutes is a dead giveaway nowadays for a missing, boring plot. One can assume the script was written by AI in early beta stage.I give 1 star to every movie I'm unable to finish watching. Save your time!",
    "36": "What are those critics, on mushrooms?You know the movie is trash when you have to (barely) survive a 20 minute monologue with Fassbender, while he is yoga stretching on loop.. before he accidentally shoots the.. And ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about 20 minutes of opening time!Lets not go into Oh but its not for everybody.. stop, just stop.This got to be one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever (almost in full) watched and critics give it 72 percent.. Imagine Bullet train getting 49..\nIt is just a boring mess, there is literally no connection between the viewer and any characters and the story is just.. Hang on, what story?",
    "37": "David Fincher name alone makes you wanna watch the movie, and only a few directors have this power. His last creation is a most watch for anyone who loves movies, yet I feel a little bit disappointed after watching the 2 hours The Killer, don't get me wrong, it's a good movie with essentially Fassbender on the screen (really good) and some unique visual style, the movie is more a character study than an action movie, a lot is happening yet nothing happens which makes the movie good but easily forgettable, especially the last act, you will probably enjoy some good scenes, a few good quotes about modern society but as soon as the film ends you will move on to something else like you watched nothing....that's the limits of the latest Fincher movie!",
    "38": "The killer is the most garrulous assassin you will ever come across.We see how he waits for his heart to reach 60 bpm and in so doing misses his intended target and kills what looks to be a dominatrix.Oh well - close but no cigar.This mistake - one imagines it is his first - results in not only himself but his girlfriend becoming a target.Not so clever now is it?He has the nerve to be annoyed and sets out on a ruthless trail of death - killing people who have done nothing to deserve it as well as those who have. He never had my sympathy - but I was rooting for him to die when he killed the young taxi driver.He kills others of course - and we are treated to endless scenes of how he cleans up after himself - getting rid of evidence etc.It is cool today for evil to triumph and this is no different - film makers lack the guts these days to make a stand against it.\"Get Carter\" 1971 got it right - and was a far superior film for it.",
    "39": "The Killer is the best picture this year. Technically, it's perfectly executed. There is nothing to criticize. The score is amazing and blends perfectly with the soundtrack and sounddesign. The cinematography is phenomenal and Fassbender is outstanding.It's quite a slow-moving thriller. And it's awesome. Fassbender spends a lot of time doing nothing while narrating it and talking nonsense. It might not sound fantastic but you could watch several hours of this. When movies do narration well, it can not get much better. To hear his thoughts live while making it seem natural is hard to do.How can you not enjoy a movie about a intelligent guy who's good at doing his job? It's thrilling and highly enjoyable. One of Fincher's best. Doesn't say too much since most of his movies are incredible.",
    "40": "I liked the film, the picture is closed on the main character and focused on his worldview - \"If you think that the world is a common goal, then it shows how little you know\"\nAs always, all Fincher's films involve the viewer, and all the paintings have a detective basis, it intrigues with a complex internal structure and, at the same time, is understandable and readable.Closer to the finale, the picture seems simplified: the scene with the expert, it seems to me an unobvious climax and it seems to be written by another author, with this scene there is disappointment - the whole intrigue crumbles, and one main goal of the hero is revealed - ensuring security for himself and his woman; the hero finds conditional security, and the viewer gets hope for continuation stories. A very thoughtful scenario with a simple story - the hero takes revenge and protects his future. The movie is great, but a little disappointing with the last act.",
    "41": "Sorry, I wanted to like it but it was awful. I liked the character, but the story (movie) just ruined it. This movie is S L O W and never kicks off. It just fizzles out in a very derivative and expected way. The trailer is great, just watch that and imagine the movie you were sold in that trailer and then expect the complete opposite.You have this \"perfectionist\" that clearly isn't making it seem like he has it all figured out when he doesn't. You have cities and locales mentioned that look nothing at all like then cities themselves. I'm not sure where it was filmed, but it did not do a good job of representing at least two of the cities in have lived in as there was zero resemblance.It was just a huge bore and I felt the trailer promised a \"bill of goods\" and just did not deliver.",
    "42": "I understand the point of the main character is to be aloof and \"a killer\" however it leaves you feeling nothing for him. The actions he took did not make me want him to succeed and really kept me from being able to get into the movie. If you're not rooting for the main character there's really no point in the plot. Kept waiting for the movie to be over. Felt nothing towards the main character and I did not care for his quest for revenge. The plot contains no surprises or clever moments, you just kind of sit through it. Absolutely awful. So unbelievably contrived and dull. The script is so terrible it's impossible for him to act his way out of it.",
    "43": "Supeeer slow movie. Predictable, nothing special and 2 hours lost. :( The main actor is cool but the story very very disappointing. Don't waste your time on my opinion. They wrote from people who made zodiac and seven but nothing even a bit comparable with this movie. Nowadays very few movies are as good as the old ones. Also how this movie is rated with so good rate I can't even imagine. :(\nSo overall good playing for the main actor but very bad story. There is nothing in the movie that makes you to watch with interest. I scroll in internet while watching and I missed nothing from the movie..",
    "44": "I love David Fincher and Micheal Fassbender... what are they trying to do here?!? We get it he's a multi millionaire assasin with various aliases \"clever with the sitcom references \" I little fight club sprinkle... but wtf guys??? I don't get the unsatisfying ending or why he wacked the guy in Florida thumbs way down. Who was the prime suspect in the beginning?!? And what that has to do with anything?)? Oh it's deep... no it's a crummy movie... c'mon man\nI was intellectually insulted with this piece of art crap I'm running out of words to fill this review... not the worst movie in the world but still a hunk of crap.",
    "45": "People were expecting to see just another mind-numbing John Wick action film with never ending gun shots and bloody knife fights, but instead, the killer was starting to talk, and talk endlessly. He's was supposed to fight, not talk, right? Where is explosion? This is boring. What is this? There's something seriously wrong about this movie, right? There's nothing wrong about this movie, The Killer. It's actually almost perfect. The story telling and the pacing is very well done. The editing is top notch just as good as Fight Club - I'm not gonna lie Fight Club is still a better movie. Michael Fassbender's acting is just cherry on top. There aren't many good movies nowadays especially on netflix, but this is definitely good one. .",
    "46": "Oh, wow, this was a boring one. From the first shot we realise that this hitman is a amateur. Then we have to follow this bozo around for two hours. Listening to endless boring thoughts about life, and... well I don't know what really.The action is sub par, and the story are just confused and pointless. If this movie was made by another director who doesn't have a fan base that likes everything - it would just passed unoticed.So... is it anything good to say about the movie. Hmm, let's see. There must be something... Oh yes, maybe it could be that there's not much of the usual Hollywood virtue signalling in it.",
    "47": "Just watched based on rating but narration in beginning makes entire movie boring.Movie starts quickly without much opening credits but then it's all about narration for next 20 mins without anything happening. The killer in the room and narration continues for long which makes it boring. I was just waiting for narration to end. The narration also does not add anything to the story. Its just the random thoughts of the killer. The story then picks up some pace after the hit job goes wrong but doesn't keep you hooked. He then moves to different place around the world to escape the attack on him and his family. This movie needs a lot of patience to watch.",
    "48": "The worst movie I watched in a long time. After done watching it, I still do not know anything about the main character. Maybe that he is an idiot as he tries to repeat the same thing over and over again with the same failed result and not seeing that what he is doing, is not working.Most of the movie is watching a man travel from place to place. Nothing else. Just travel. If you into a guy traveling in a diffrent kinds of transportation, go for it.All the hype about this movie must be by the people involved in production because this movie really takes you nowhere. Don't waste your time on this.",
    "49": "Did you enjoy American Psycho? If so then this is a perfect modern take. Full of dull dry nothingness to entertain the last brain cell pleading for death. Will death ever be granted? Watch to the end to find out.OrSave yourself. Turn off the movie and never look back. If you liked this main actors acting as Magneto then again this may be the bland cuppa for you. The only saving grace of this lack of action/drama was Tilda. The second I saw her I thought, oh my gosh finally some blood will be pumped into this corpse. Sadly the few seconds we get to revive are quickly snuffed out.This is a movie where nothing happens and nothing can be said about it. Enjoy.",
    "50": "This film is exactly what you might imagine it to be, based on whatever promotional artwork you're looking at. Michael Fassbender is The Killer. No surprises, and no thinking required. Many years ago a very disturbing film was released called Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer. There was no internal monologue, just Henry going through life killing people without any conscience. It was weird, but it worked. The problem with The Killer is that you can see everything coming from a mile away because there's been a million films like this, so you know there's going to be a crooked lawyer and a rich guy and a beautiful woman and a huge thug. Ho hum. The greatest injustice in this film is that the accomplished and mercurial Tilda Swinton only appears for five minutes, but she makes the most of it. The ending leaves the door wide open for a boring sequel.",
    "51": "It was nearly all tedious dialogue. Fassbender was hopelessly miscast. There was little substance, virtually no suspense, a massive number of plot holes, and it was very predictable. A Fincher disaster, frankly.Why make the viewers suffer through Fassbender's constantly telling us all his thoughts? Who cares? We're left with him doing yoga-and the man isn't the slightest bit sexy. The actor wasn't competent enough to look at ease with that-or any other-scene.The only good actor was the dog. And when he chased Fassbender, I wished that he would catch him-and bite him. At least that would have been a good idea.Avoid this film-unless you have insomnia. This load of rubbish will put you to sleep.",
    "52": "It's just meh. Slow, and the whole thing just doesn't make sense (at least for me).There is a saying, that in order to sympathize with a bad boy (or anyone) you need to know more about their background. Well, in this movie nothing appears to be revealed about \"the killer\", only the fact that he has a girlfriend. (That's it? Meh.) So, I couldn't connect to this guy at all, and ended up not like him. This whole movie is just a big chaos. He goes to random places and kinda kills random people. (Okay, not that random, because he goes after something, but it really not clear WTF is going on...) Then in the end he goes to that last guy (?) and doesn't k*ll him. Why? So far he is k*lling literally everyone, and in the end he has a soft heart?The whole movie is incompetent, and inconvenient.",
    "53": "David Fincher has done it again with \"The Killer.\" Based on a comic, the film delivers a quiet yet intensely thrilling experience. The precise narrative mirrors the journey of the antihero, portrayed excellently by Michael Fassbender as an emotionless (when it comes to the job) killer, offering an unbelievably well-crafted and intriguing exploration of the psyche of a wounded and betrayed character. The film demands patience and an understanding of the story, preparing something that often gets overlooked in modern cinema with the shift from movies to content. Unlike the anticipation of the next climax in a horror or Marvel film, here, the entire story maintains a constant tension, making it an experience where even pre-viewing yoga won't help.",
    "54": "Had the unfortunate experience of sitting through this utter piece of garbage last evening. There film just moves at it own pace with so many repeated v/o in which the same lines are pointlessly being repeated.For someone who sounds so sorted and intelligent about his profession our killer tends to make a so many mistakes while he executing.The direction is very impressive but besides that there is absolutely no story, our killer is a boring as a dead duck who keeps talking to himself and just keeps numb when he's interacting with others.Overall this film is just a tedious watch and it will test your patience.",
    "55": "I am 22 mins in and if I were you I would skip to at least minute 22. Absolutely nothing of any consequence happens in the first 21 mins. I was actually gonna sack it for being so utterly boring - but I skipped forwardAt about 20 mins in something rather idiotic happens when someone is always (idiotically) getting in the way of the mission and then \"boom!\" - the mission of our so called \"expert\" fails - right before our eyes. Such a smart guy who ain't that smart after all.This may or may not get any better - but so far it's so boring it's unreal. I am hoping I managed to skip to the bit where things liven up a bit - but I don't hold my breath.My overall opinion \"so far so bad\" - but let's see.",
    "56": "My wife and I were hoping to see an intriguing movie here but could not get past the first 20 minutes because of the exuding evil. I guess we're just not cut out for this even though it's prevalent in movies today so everyoneelse must love it.We were hopeful after the killer's first assassination shot but then came a blistering blasphemy so we could no longer endure.Perhaps we missed out on what might be a redeeming story but alas we did not take the chance and risk more of the same darkness that we'd seen up to that point.Yes, we're tired of seeing darkness when we seek a little entertainment. Like the song says, all I want is LOVE!",
    "57": "With Hollywood love affair with making up new words, like Barbenheimer, why has no one branded this gilded terd Finchbender? You have two wildly talented and popular Hollywood figures coming together to pinch out more garbage onto society. This is better than the average Netflix movie, no question. But it is still not good. The first half of the movie feels like a really long montage video for The Smiths. In the end the film is a long bloody journey to nowhere, with unrequested heaping sides of boredom along the way. One thing I can say, if you are suffering from insomnia try watching this film while lying down on the couch. You'll be out like a light.",
    "58": "When it comes to movies that feature hitmen I always wonder whether the director thinks his audience is stupid. Why do hitmen always do stuff that no professional killer would do? For instance, in this movie:\nHe stand for hours in front of a window waiting for his target to arrive, people can see him constantlyHe drives a big fat car in the Dominican yet he narrates to be not standing out and quietHe listens to music when he needs to make the shot, what if someone behind him comes in (this actually happened before)He gets rid of phones but stamping on them but never checks whether they are really deadHe doesn't always wear gloves when holding guns that he usesIn the end he shows his face to 4 waiters in the restaurantHe sleeps in his car in front of his targets house, wtfHe exhibits all his passports and guns while two cleaning people are cleaning up the mess in his house (where was the police btw in this whole blood-covered adventure that took place in his house?)All of this would have been ok, if: he DIDN'T say throughout the movie how professional he is and what things to be careful of etc. Really are we considered stupid??Besides that, I thought the acting was quite good, storyline ok, kind of exciting, ending sort of unexpected but also a bit weird considering the guy saw him and even spoke with him.@all directors out there, stop taking your audience for stupid, we are not.",
    "59": "Even before the brain-dead catalyst finally happens I was ready to turn off the movie after the seemingly endless voice-over by the main character.Sadly I stuck with it just long enough to realize this is yet another film that hopes the audience is too stupid to notice they didn't put any real thought into it.We are tricked into believing the contract killer is a cold, impersonal professional who knows how to hide and blend into his surroundings, yet he occupies his hide for days while leaving no doubt of his presence due to the large uncovered windows and twin-head work light illuminating him for all to see. The space is also presented as abandoned yet inexplicably receives a pile of mail for no other purpose than to force a \"tense\" moment that is anything but.When his inner monologue mercifully ends he is finally able to take his shot, even though he had far better opportunities much sooner. He reassembles his weapon yet again, because why would you keep it ready when the opportunity could come at any time? He gets set up, then begins tracking everyone in the room. Uh, no. You track your target and fire the moment the shot is available.He finally takes the shot even though the target's evening entertainment is gyrating in front of him and she of course steps into the path of the bullet as the trigger is pulled. Instead of remaining focused and squeezing off another round from the fully loaded magazine, the killer panics and flees in the most clumsy and obvious way possible.Not much of a professional. More like a rank amateur. That was all I could take and watched Moon Zero Two from 1969 instead.",
    "60": "It was 60% percent tedious monologue and 40% about an assassin who kinda sucked at being an assassin. Seriously, the first 10-15 minutes is a boring conversation within his head about redundancy and discipline. It puts terrible Japanese animes to shame which overuse monologue. It almost comes across as simply filler for the movie.If that weren't enough, it seemed like he had weird priorities. He kills a couple Innocents and then leaves the guy who paid to have him killed alive. To top it off, it's all fairly anticlimactic.The saving grace in the whole thing was Tilda Swinton. Her part, albeit short, kind of was the best part.This would've been been pretty good as a short film, but not a full fledged movie. A couple good fight scenes, but that's it.",
    "61": "Unwatchable after 10 minutes. Shocked that it has a 7 rating. Doesn't deserve that high of a score. The main actor is not interesting enough to hold my attention with voice over that makes no sense except that it's how this character is supposed to think. We watch him go thru his boring day watching his target as if the life of a killer is interesting. This one is not. Other movies have done a waaay better job - Killing Eve is a good example and La Femme Nikita. Stopped watching at 13:48 as it is more of the same since the beginning of the movie! I do like the actor is other movies such as Assassin's Creed.",

Anyone who has lived out in the country with a dog knows if the dog is upset barking you go to see why. A trained assassin wouldn't just ignore it.It's hard to believe Michael Fasbender needed money so badly that he signed up for such a low budget horrible movie.",

Part of the problem is that Hollywood is void of morality or any sense of social responsibility. Even talented filmmakers- this film is well executed- pander to this promotion of murder, endless killing, soulless \"heroes \", it's beyond disgusting. As stated before, the people behind this film are talented. But lazy. It's easy to help society slide down that drain. It takes effort, creativity, originality to be entertaining and not destructive. Like being funny without being mean.",

It felt almost refreshing from the onslaught of fast paced action films of today. However it soon turns Into just another assassin film and follows almost the exact narrative of most of them. The biggest problem with this film is that it really feels pointless. The narrative of the hitman has his wife beaten or killed so hunts the perpetrators down and kills them one by one has been done a hundred times before and dare I say it done better.

The start of this movie almost lost me as we just had Michael Fassbender deliver a never-ending narration while he waits to execute a hit. But then when I thought about the character, it made sense. Fincher's attention to detail throughout the entire movie is immaculate as every little thing plays an important part. During this beginning, we see how precise Fassbender is as he cleans up after himself to avoid leaving a trace, to trying to keep his heart rate low to prevent certain mistakes from happening when the time comes for the hit, and to him getting something from McDonald's to eat while he waits. All the while he's seemingly narrating to himself almost like he's bored and trying to focus on something that gives him that structure to stick to his plans and methods. And the narration brilliantly cuts out when Fassbender gets caught up in the moment.This is also a very intelligent and smartly written movie that requires you to think, and for me at least, I really liked this as it made it a fun challenge to figure out certain elements in the film and to always pay attention to details.The technicalities of the film are also simply phenomenal and easily the best I've seen from a film this year.

    "90": "I'm a huge fan of David Fincher's work. I consider Zodiac, The Social Network, & Fight Club to be amongst my favorite films, and Mindhunter in that same category for TV shows. So, even with The Killer dropping on Netflix, I went to a special theater showing to see it on the big screen. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way in to this one--mainly because plot-lovers (like me) will largely be a bit lost.For a very basic overview, \"The Killer\" tells the story of the unnamed Killer (Michael Fassbender) hired to perform a rather tedious assassination. When the plan goes a bit awry, however, he must compromise--or at least re-evaluate--some of his principles as he ventures into uncharted emotional territory.The Killer is certainly a clinic in cinematography and choreography, as is the usual Fincher style. Its action set pieces are tension-filled and Fassbender's flat aesthetic is perfect for the lead role. Half the film's dialogue is the Killer's snarky inner monologue, and again Fassbender nails that.The big problem--at least for plot-lovers--here is that there is seemingly very little context or rhyme/reason for what we see transpire. Almost nothing is provided other than what is literally playing out in front of viewers in any given scene. As such, I really struggled to care about anything that was happening--in large part because it quite frankly felt like a series of disconnected interludes as opposed to a whole, coherent story. There were times I even felt bored watching because I knew an extended espionage scene was upcoming and I didn't fully understand the stakes.Seeing as how The Killer is getting relatively high marks, I can assume either one of two things is happening: 1. Audiences are not as hung-up on the lack of discernible plot/motives than I; or 2. There is a deeper message here that I'm just utterly missing. Perhaps the ongoing monologue holds the key--but again, I found that more snarky/sardonic than informative.Perhaps more analysis or a second viewing will crystalize The Killer for me--but as it stands in the immediate aftermath of my first viewing I have to place it near (perhaps at) the bottom of the Fincher canon.",
    "91": "\" Stick to the plan. Anticipate, don't improvise. Trust no one. Yield no advantage. Forbid empathy.\" The Killer Michael FassbenderYou've seen cool killers in film before, but maybe not like this one. David Fincher is a fearless director tackling challenging films from Se7en and Gone Girl to Mank and many different subjects in between. The Killer is different from other films about assassins but the same in many respects. His Killer has the cool of Keanua Reeves' John Wick, the ingenuity of Sean Connery's James Bond, and not even close to the warmth of Denzel Washington's Equalizer.Above all he's chill; the introductory quote gives the idea that he is as close to a killing machine as has ever appeared on screen. Reeves looks downright humane by contrast. Yet, like Wick, he is impelled to revenge as he tracks down his employer and operatives, who include Tilda Swinton's Expert at her androgynous, ambiguous best. We never learn his real name, but his aliases are legion, connecting him to us in macabre impersonation of our primal urge to revenge. He use names like Thomas Jefferson, Archie Bunker, and Felix Unger, all from TV and history.To see him order some of his tools from the Amazon Smartphone App is to send an extra chill of recognition and connection. To hear him lament he can't recall his last \"nice quiet drowning\" is to paint a portrait of an amoral ghoul. However, the film is replete with dark jokes like The Expert's bear joke or the parmesan grater.Avenging his girlfriend's beating, Killer tracks down each of her attackers with a precision that the voiceover analysis of his work manifests. Mostly it's about sticking to the plan, not being distracted, and not giving into sympathies. His chat track is late night show amusing but without back story or emotion.He has broken a cardinal rule of his profession by revenging his girlfriend's misfortune. While he exclaims to be indifferent and cold to emotions, his voice over continues to assert the revenge\nnecessity. In that way, writer Andrew Kevin Walker connects us to emotional weaknesses in us all. After all, his hat and his problems are not much different from Brad Pitt's in Bullet Train.What we do see is a man who is regimented and cool enough to kill for a profession and love and defend a woman who has brought him close to death. In this way, he adds dimension to an MO almost solely owned by John Wick, without the body count. As Total Film's Jan Crowther comments, \"And if you ever wondered what Fincher's Bond might have looked like, this could be it.\"The Killer is a hypnotizing study of lethal precision with only a hint of humanity. If you wait for it on Netflix, you can savor the director's precise use of his own cinematic tools as many times as you want. And with intermittent snacks.\"I am who I am.\" Popeye, quoted by the Killer.",
    "92": "After reading the reviews on this site I had mixed expectations. The cinematography is fine but the story is very poor and sometimes slow paced.The actions you see coming miles away and it began really weak for a wannabe killer.I cannot explain myself how director David Fincher could accept this disappointing script.Nonetheless I am happy I didn't spent one cent for this sleeper cause I watched it on Netflix.The main role that delivered the killer couldn't present his own qualities of actor. There weren't many dialogues. Instead he was narrating during all the running time of this movie.So be warned. My wife and me rate it 3/10 that is definitely too overrated on IMDb.There are much more interesting thrillers of this genre for example The Equalizer 1 & 2 with Denzel Washington or Law Abiding Citizen with Gerard Butler.",
    "93": "This movie is perfectly fine. It is so perfectly fine, that I can´t think of a single explicit point of criticism at all. However, i can´t think of anything that made it particularly great either. It is too clean. Meanwhile that is the point of the movie. It is about a man whose entire life revolves around minimizing errors, being in control, and following a set of internalized rules without emotions ever coming in the way. And it is an interesting idea to see a hitman treating the profession of violently murdering people as just another repetitive 9 to 5 job, that you just have to get through day after day. But when it comes to telling a compelling story, that is a bit of a problem. Because what generally makes movies stand out - even thrillers like these - is the ability to get people emotionally invested, to have them feel with the characters. This is explicitly not, what is happening here. There is not a single emotion in this movie. It is kind of about revenge but not really. You are just watching a man go through his perfected way of getting his job done and this job just so happens to be killing people who show varying degrees of innocence. We don´t even know anyone´s name. There is however one amazing fight scene that has one of the best choreographies that I have seen in Hollywood in a long time and which had me at the edge of my seat for at least five minutes. Irnoically, this is also the only scene where the character decides to not follow his set of rules and ignores the fact that he might be a little bit too emotional to perfectly execute his task. And it is the most gripping scene of the movie. Maybe that means something...7/10.",
    "94": "David Fincher just about always knocks it out of the park. Even with something I don't really connect to emotionally or find riveting, like Mank, I can appreciate and generally see what he's going for.The Killer will probably end up feeling a little underrated. It's set to go to Netflix soon, where people will discuss it for about a week and then it'll disappear into the sea of content. It even happens to the most provocative and conversation-starting of movies (when's the last time you heard someone talk about 2022's Blonde?)The generic name might not help, but I could also see that being part of the commentary. I do love how narratively this is nice and simple, frequently tense, and quite entertaining, but there's a fair bit going on under the surface. There are themes here that it feels like Fincher's explored a good deal throughout his career (narratively and visually it's very different to Fight Club, but thematically, it feels reminiscent), and tonally/stylistically, it's right up his alley. A precise and calculated filmmaker taking on a story about a seemingly precise and calculated assassin - you love to see it.I was glad to see this in a cinema. It might've been harder to get immersed in the deliberate pacing and quieter moments if I'd watched it at home. The use of sound and music was also fantastic, and was helped immensely by the cinema's sound system.Also, this film's got to have what will end up being one of the year's best action sequences. You'll know it when you see it.",
    "95": "The definition of a good thriller is that the plot should be slick and smart. That means the film is edited in such a way that it follows the narrative closely without a lot of extra fluff. It also means all the characters in the story act like real human beings and make logical decisions. One thing I have found about David Fincher is that he has OCD when it comes to details. The details are presented in an intelligent fashion. In this film, the details can be straight forward or logical when it comes to the plot. Fincher tells the story through cutaways, insert shots showing the little details that explain our main character's actions. For example, early on when the Killer (who remains unnamed) loads a magazine into his gun, it takes no less than three cutaways to accomplish this.The opening act has a voyeuristic perspective, akin to \"Rear Window\" as we slowly get into the Killer's head through voiceover. The first act has an almost hypnotic quality as we study his situation, vigilantly maintaining a stakeout over several days, waiting for a mark. Filmmakers need to be careful when using voiceover, as it sometimes can be a conceit. Usually you try to tell the story through visuals. Here, the majority of the voiceover remains in the first act. Then through the rest of the film, bits we heard earlier are repeated at key moments during the film. My reaction is that these extra VO drops were unnecessary, but also act as a disruption. His train of thought in these moments is confronted with an unanticipated setback.Finchers adds a couple touches of humour. I have stated in another review how important it is to find the right amount of humour to an otherwise serious drama. Too little and the drama starts to get stiff. Too much, and you are being removed from the reality of the situation. Fincher keeps the humour to a minimum, compared to one of his peers, Steven Soderbergh. Soderberg excels in this genre, with films like \"Out of Sight\" and \"Haywire\". The latter also includes Michael Fassbinder, the pro/antagonist in this film. All the supporting characters this film are almost cameos, but all are excellent.The story remains focused on the Killer, never really revealing the greater plot, or what to anticipate as we follow the Killer through his agenda. But again, this is smart scriptwriting because it respects the audience's intelligence, who can easily fill in the blanks. Another staple of the Thriller genre is globe-hopping, James Bond style. The film is constantly on the move, as our main character travels from one airport to another. It is also adds the extra element of realism by shooting mostly on location (save for some interiors). The moments of action are well done. There are \"Bourne\" like moments with the action scenes, but not as frequent.The film, because it is a singularly focused story about the Killer and a job gone wrong, has a generally small scope. The actions of the Killer are pretty straightforward, and there are no real twists. I appreciated that lack of multiple subplots, too many scripts try to overachieve and can become confusing by throwing too many side characters or too many twists. The slim story could be a drawback if expectations were higher. However, Fincher is very skilled at drawing you into the workings of clandestine activities with his meticulous cutaways (sometimes he'll shoot 70 takes to get a shot right). This precision matches the Killer's precision in resolving his issues.There is only one gimmick that made me groan. Everytime the Killer presents an ID at an airport or rental car place, we see his alias is the name of a well known sitcom character. This is a cute moment of humour, but in reality would be a very stupid thing for our smart assassin. One doesn't even need to be of the 70s generation to recognise these well known character names (Sam Malone, Bob Hartly, Felix Unger, Archibald Bunker, etc,). Reruns of these TV shows run on digital side channels and on streaming services, so younger generations would also be able to recognise these names. If there is a security agency (like Interpol) looking for him, once they link a sitcom character's name to the Killer, they can easily search for other fictional sitcom characters to try and track him.Ultimately, I sat through this procedural with rapt attention, with the tight editing and intriguing spycraft providing the momentum. With the opening titles resembling the quick montage of action shots and graphics like \"Mission Impossible\", it set expectations appropriately. One of the better thrillers made recently, it rises above other movies like \"Equalizer 3\" (which left me wanting). Not as big in scope and story as \"Fight Club\" or \"Zodiac\", but entertaining as \"Se7en\" and his outstanding TV series \"Mindhunter\". 7 out of 10.",
    "96": "Too slow, too simple, and too uninteresting. The Killer is a misfire in the entertainment department. I kept checking to see how much time was left. To use a music term; there's no dynamics. It's a very monotone experience. It's starts slow and keeps that exact pace throughout its entirety, with the exception of one exciting fight scene.Michael Fassbender is a fine actor but this role doesn't allow him to do much acting. It's as monotone as the movie itself. He hardly speaks, except for the occasional narration from his thoughts. Are the thoughts of this paranoid, emotionless, OCD assassin interesting? Sometimes. But mostly we just watch him moving about and scoping out places.In the end, I can say this movie exists, and it seems like that's all it wanted to do... just exist... nothing more, nothing less. It's like an escalator; it takes you from one spot to another while you casually people watch and check your phone to see what time it is.",
    "97": "Fassbender and Fincher have crafted a cold and very slick thriller. It's incredibly unique and in many ways, brilliant. It will certainly not be for everyone and it should not be categorised as an action film.David Fincher's directing is as crisp and precise as always. The cinematography is great and the film looks incredible. It's technically sound and visually stunning with its cold contrasted shots. Fassbender is as brilliant as always and commands the scenes.BUT, my brain cannot seem to accept the simplicity of the story. I expected something completely different from this and i really believe that the synopsis provided is misleading. It does not feel like there are any stakes in this film nor character development and under no point is there serious danger. We get a brief (cliche) incident to get us started and then it is monotone the rest of the way, much like the protagonist. Maybe there's a hidden, beautiful parallel to that, i dont know.I feel like i need to watch this again with a different mindset because it's not what i expected or what was advertised.Despite my complaints, i liked this movie. I just wish the story and action sequences had been expanded a lot more. It's worth a watch, just not the watch you're expecting.",
    "98": "Much love to David Fichter. He's definitely one of the best filmmakers out there, and he does not have to beat us over the head with it. Case in point the Killer.The timing and pacing of this movie were perfect the most perfect i seen this year. While your Marty Scorseses and your Chris Nolans are like \"You'll sit through a three-hour movie!? Great\"! Fichter seems to get the concept of not wasting our time.The Killer told a perfect story and just when thought that story was finished, he added something to the story that made you ok with getting a little more. No other movie this year did that! Not even the juggernauts of the game did that!Micheal Fassbender picked the right movie to return in. It's been a long time, but he made it known that we missed him with this movie.The Killer just made everything that came before it seems over bloated. This was perfection.",
    "99": "Of course, elite director David Fincher's stunningly strong canon of work deserves respect, but as the saying goes 'you're only as good as your last film' and this one is distinctly below average.It starts off excrutiatingly slowwwww and never gets off the ground. Micheal Fassbender puts in a typically solid turn as the title character (just as well, being in practically every scene) but the boring, lacklustre screenplay, lack of excitement and wordy voiceover throughout can't save it from disappearing up its own a$$.As usual from Fincher the direction, camera work, editing and minut detail are top-notch, while Trent Reznors soundtrack adds atmosphere and nuance. However the overuse of The Smiths music throughout is annoying (not a fan), while a distinct lack of pacing, emotion, thrills or genuine surprises cannot paper over the cracks.It's all rather bland and predictable, and was done way better in numerous other hitman flicks (try Road to Perdition, No Country for Old Men, Leon etc). All in all then a forgettable Fincher film that sounded so promising but ultimately ended up firing blanks.",
    "100": "The few good things about this movie - that is, the deadpan, laid-back but meticulous voice-over of the narrator, describing, with almost scientific exactitude, his plans, attitudes, conclusions, and his utter lack of doubt about the efficiency of his method, are lifted straight from the movie Ghost Dog.Everything half interesting about this POV tale of an assassin with a philosophical bent, an assassin who has to correct an imbalance in his psychic universe, an assassin that proceeds through and over the obstacles ahead of him as if they didn't exist, and with the same disregard for the lives of others as for the safety of himself, all of it is taken directly from Ghost Dog and Forrest Whitaker's coldly, calculatedly, eerily calm and efficient performance. The one thing that is revolutionarily new is the ending and, well, it's garbage.Then again, if you're going to listen to Morrissey and the Smiths endlessly from one end of the film to the other, as does the protagonist here, then maybe the Assassin's Life seems like a good option.Terrible movie. Avoid.",
    "101": "You put the words David Fincher on any movie and it's instantly gonna have my full attention. I think he's just so reliable and consistent as a filmmaker that I know I'm gonna get so much out of every film he makes. I've been following The Killer since the second it was announced and, while I don't quite think it's the best film he's ever made, it's a fantastic addition to Fincher's filmography that's satisfying in a way that only he could deliver.There's a precision to every aspect of this movie that feels totally reflective of its main character but also very telling of Fincher as a filmmaker. At his second shortest movie there isn't a single moment wasted. For as much time as Fincher spends on the set up for these set pieces, it always feels deliberate and pays off in a wholly satisfying way.The film relies heavily on voice over to describe this characters inner motivations and it can take a few scenes to get accustomed to but once it does it feels like a vital past of the Killers development. Whenever we get dialogue from him it feels completely earned and with Michael Fassbender's chillingly on point performance there's so much more weight to his lines than there would've been otherwise.The story isn't exactly anything to write home about but it doesn't really have to be. It's a basic investigation and revenge set up that we've seen before but with the aesthetic that Fincher produces from that it's hard to really care. I will say that the motivations of this character feel a little bit underdeveloped. As stoic as he is by design I felt like I needed to see a bit more of his personal life to get fully invested in the journey he goes on. Being based of a graphic novel the script feels deliberately episodic and that ended being a bit of a double edged sword for me because certain locations and sequences felt a lot more interesting to watch than others. Having said that though I'm very excited to rewatch this movie with a clean slate to see how some of the weaker aspects evolve for me. Other Fincher films have had some of these weaknesses for me but they've historically evaporated for me upon a second viewing.For a David Fincher assassin movie, this was almost everything I wanted it to be. It's gorgeously shot and so well paced that the fairly basic story didn't matter all that much in the end. For all its under explored aspects, it's so well realised as a vision that it's hard not to just go along for the ride. This was my first Fincher in a cinema and it felt like such a fitting first experience. This man is one of the best working today for a reason and I already can't wait to see what he's going to do next.",
    "102": "Nothing new here that's the disappointing part, great directors often give us high expectations given their former work but not all their movies are masterpieces and I guess that's all right.. Some are more consistent than others of course, but long story short this is a regular hitman movie, with great cinematography and direction and a great lead.It's not that the movie is bad, everything looks good, I didn't mind the approach to the story, the fact that it is a monologue from the main character and you navigate the story he tells is all right - it's well acted and directed which is what kept me interested but other than that is average at best...\nThe dialogue seems a bit forced, while trying to convey these pseudo life lessons it feels like I am looking at quotes on Facebook and the plot couldn't be more basic...Overall it's an okay movie, its style and production are great and Fassbender delivers as expected, but it's not enough to make it memorable or compelling.It seems after all these years Netflix keeps its formula of enlisting a famous actor for a an average movie to keep their subscriptions going.",
    "103": "\"Execution is everything\"is the tagline of The Killer and makes for a perfect meta-commentary that connects the essence of the film with the life's work of its director.David Fincher is as meticulous in his filmmaking craft here as his main character is in his professional craft. The Killer could become the new handbook for \"how to make a perfect looking film\". A picture put on canvas, so thoroughly thought out and taken care of, I couldn't help myself while sitting in the theater but marvel over its execution and attention to detail. I literally had Goosebumps half the time because I was so gripped by the atmosphere and beauty that unfolded in front of me. Perhaps Finchers most meditative piece. Fincher delivers his dark and gritty tendencies in familiar fashion, but this time slightly more reserved and introspective. With scalpel-like accuracy he carefully constructs a gripping character study that tackles the addictive nature of a personal vendetta as well as the mental sanity and emotional control needed to remain successful and alive in this line of work. A constant heartbeat within the sound design, the effortlessly rythmic editing and the hauntingly calm narration from Michael Fassbender, who acts as methodically meticulous as David Fincher directs. A man who will so easy take a life, and the unpredictable and tense nature of this subject matter make for a shockingly effective and nerve-racking experience.What a streak of cinema, my favorite directors all come out with new work, my film heart is full.",
    "104": "You've all seen this story before, but never this intensely boring, never this predictable, never this smooth, without twists, surprises and suspense. The movie starts with the voice-over of the hitman: \"If you are unable to endure boredom, this work is not for you.\" He is talking about his profession, but it can be seen as a fair warning - or a great, cynical joke that most people will only get, when it's already too late.This is a very dry version of the cartoonish \"John Wick\"-movies. But while Wick only kills his colleagues, Michael Fassbender's Killer will also murder the innocent. He is not a likeable character, just an emotionless, highly efficient tool. The only hint of his personality is that he always listens to the 80ies band \"The Smiths\", self-pityingly lamenting \"I am human and I need to be loved\" or revelling in violent phantasies, \"If a double-decker bus crashes into us\". It is probably supposed to humanize him, but it is just annoying.While \"The Killer\" bears some resemblances to French crime movies of the 60ies, it is actually based on a series of French comic books that started in 1998. The only surprise bigger than that is that this drab, forgettable, useless film is made by David Fincher. As the story sounds - and is - incredibly stale, it's his name that will draw in the audience. \"The Killer\" is bound to destroy quite a bit of his reputation.",
    "105": "Heard about this film said to be truly great, for a very long time now. So i really was pretty exited for it and i had high expectations.The first thing i early noticed, that was abit unique, was the great and deep manuscript. Very good! But alot of repeated dialogues.ButThe movie totally fails to keep up with the nice manuscript, resulting in getting pretty slow, slightly confusing storyline and boring. The style is pretty dark and special. But other tgen that nothing more unique to it really. I excepted more and to be honest, it feels like a b-movie sometimes. Extremely loose story that doesn't really fit.And i dont really understand the 7.2 rating and why it got selected in Venice Film festival.Acting is very bad.I wouldn't really recommend it.",
    "106": "Netflix ruined everything, and I mean everything. There must be someone who should be able to put a stop to this nonsense. Fincher is not a bad director, but this movie is absolutely hot garbage. There is nothing redeemable about it. Everything looks like it was shot with a cheap DSLR with the resolution turned up to the max \" just because\" , thrown in tesolve for a quick color edit, and some bespectacled nerd at Netflix ordered to have some cool reference for the kids.At some point, the killer in question even comments about, and I quote, \"wordle\" , order things on his phone from Amazon complete with a screen overlay straight out of \"you\", and listens to hipster Muzak.I'm not too sure what to even make of this. It's a slow descent into hell for the entire movie industry, as megacorps essentially control all narratives, and cannot, even and the cost of their own bankruptcy, create anything even mediocre. Go and watch indie films instead, or movies from foreign countries, such as Denmark, which makes excellent thrillers these days, and call it a day on Hollywood. It's done.Fincher.. seriously.... Smh.",
    "107": "I don't know why this movie script made in a weird old narrative way. From the very beginning, the hitman character started a non-stop narration, some kind of thoughts flowed in his brain and mind, but more like he's writing a memoir, talked into a recorder, describing what happened after he fouled play an assassin, and even he was so careful to hide his personal life, no matter how he zigzagged to escape from the failed contract, his employer already started to wipe him out. The narration continued blabbering through the whole situation that he had encountered and had to deal with. But what we saw in this movie was actually a mess. The hitman and hit woman who tried to kill him were a duo, one black thug, one white woman, both didn't look a bit like hitmen or assassins. The whole story went along with his memoir style narration, like watching Korean movies, cuz the characters in Korean movies often talked to himself or herself, they talked like it's the thoughts in their brains, but more like old people often talked to themselves. This stupid arrangement completely ruined the suspense, so tiresome and so unbearable.Fighting scenes usually went on in darkness. Dialogue, besides the blah, blah narration, felt so awkward and contrite. All the supporting actors who played all the roles were cast wrong, all of them were more like amateurish ordinary people. Those who hired him to do the killings were even more unbelievable, not even looked like criminals, albeit connected to some crime syndicates or organizations. The whole movie just felt like it's written by someone who didn't know anything about hitman, assassination, contract killing business. A highly anticipated thriller turned out to be a laughable mess.",
    "108": "If you are one of those people that like long shots in a movie where nothing absolutely happens, where the protagonist just goes about his day and describes the boredom to the point that YOU feel the boredom, and if you like being dropped into situations without any explanation (who is this new character, why should we invest in them?) and you consider that to be 'fine filmmaking' then you will like this movie. You probably also like 'Drive' by Nicholas Winding-Refn. A movie where Ryan Gosling pretty much drives around with a toothpick in his mouth. If however you care about things like character investment, plot, logic or something actually happening -well then this movie is NOT for you..The opening was so insanely boring - I am surprised the screenwriter did not fall asleep writing that screenplay.Skip.",

It was not what I expected and I was pleasently surprised.The plot is the standard one of revenge and the challenges that come with it.Fassbender's character is cold, clinical, and unbending - an almost anti-hero. His continues internal monologues are insighfful and quite chilling and verbalise why he is the best anbd what he does; his unwavering code makes sure there are no grey areas.The people along his path revenge on are distictive but not one-dimensional, fleshed out with enough dialogue with Fassbender's character to take you to the next stage.Many have commented that it's slow which I did not find to be the case. The two-ish hours moved along at a steady pace enopugh to keep me interested, and was complimented with very cool and slick look that went from brightly coloured to a near-noir styling at the right times.There's a few Easter eggs that will keep you paying attention for the humour and guesswork of what will happen next.Not a movie to watch when tired as you will miss a lot and things might not make sense, and watch it with another person as you will bounce things around e.g \"did you see that?\"Kick back after dinner in the early evening and don't think too hard and you will enjoy it.",
    "111": "No pun intended - it's been a few days since I watched the movie. And I got to thinking about what I saw. Always good to sleep on a movie of this caliber ... of this size, of this magnitude even. I am going out on a limb here, without having read any other reviews and say that for me this feels like Fassbender playing a different version of Fincher.David Fincher is a perfectionist. The things Michael Fassbender (our main character here) says at the beginning (and over and over again during the course of the movie) ... they sound like mantras that in a different sense are true for Fincher too. But no matter how well you play something .. something always can and will go wrong.The movie has many different sections - and while Fincher did Fight Club .. nothing is going to prepare you for that one fight scene in this movie. I did not know he had it in him - sorry for the pun. And goes for Fassbender and Fincher accordingly.But it is not just the action - it is the patience. The movie displays and the viewer has to have. The first 20-30 minutes (I did not stop the time in the theater) are quite slow to say the least. It is about preparation .. it is about ... well again you could draw comparisons to Filmmaking - the making of and the way it is consumed.But the movie continues to test its audience. If you are empathetic (and I hope most are), you will have issues with certain decisions ... the movie and our main character makes ... but they are all justified. Empathy is weakness ... for a Killer it is ... for a normal human being .. well hopefully not .. or is this another commentary on society? I am sure there are way more things to be discovered here ... so the movie warrants multiple viewings ...",
    "112": "In an era where fast-paced action and visual spectacles dominate the silver screen, \"The Killer\" takes a brave departure from the norm, embracing a deliberate and contemplative pace that challenges the audience's expectations. The film is a meditative exploration of the human condition. However, its deliberate slowness and lack of action scenes may leave some viewers yearning for a more dynamic cinematic experience.The narrative unfolds in a languid manner, these moments are intended to convey a sense of realism and introspection, they often border on the tedious, leaving viewers waiting for something more engaging to happen.One of the film's major drawbacks is its sparse use of action sequences. \"The Killer\" prioritizes introspection over external conflicts, and as a result, the narrative lacks the tension and excitement that many moviegoers seek. The absence of traditional action scenes may leave audiences yearning for a more dynamic storytelling approach, especially given the current cinematic landscape saturated with adrenaline-pumping blockbusters.The cinematography captures the beauty of the subdued color palette complements the film's contemplative tone, creating a visually arresting experience despite the lack of action.The performances from the cast, led by a subdued but impactful lead, demonstrate a commitment to the director's vision. Each actor brings a quiet intensity to their role, effectively conveying the internal struggles of their characters. However, the strength of the performances alone cannot fully compensate for the film's slow pacing and sparse action.The soundtrack provides a hauntingly beautiful backdrop to the film. The music complements the melancholic atmosphere, enhancing the emotional depth of certain scenes. Yet, even the mesmerizing soundtrack struggles to infuse energy into a narrative that predominantly relies on quiet introspection.In conclusion, \"The Killer\" is a daring departure from mainstream cinema, offering a slow-burning meditation on the transient nature of life. While the film boasts beautiful cinematography, a haunting soundtrack, and committed performances, its deliberate pace and lack of action scenes may prove challenging for viewers seeking a more dynamic cinematic experience. For those willing to embrace a slower narrative and appreciate the art of patience, \"The Killer\" may offer a unique and contemplative journey. However, for those expecting a more engaging and action-packed story, the film's languid pace might feel more like a tedious endurance test than a cinematic masterpiece.",
    "113": "My type of cinema. In every aspect. Mostly in the first half, but don't get me wrong, it's a great film that I only regret for not have the chance to see on the big screen. Of course, we talk about one of my favorite genres and directors, so maybe not the most unbiased opinion. The opening scenes in Paris gave me this Le samurai vibe mixed with the peculiar way of representing the inner world of the killer so typical for Dexter. His neat practices and habits which make him so successful in his job in the solitude of the workplace(which is ironically an office), placed by chance or not in the city of Jean-Pierre Melville's famous hit-man character, make you feel actively involved with every sense in the story. This effect is achieved not without the help of the Dexter's alike explanation of what he's doing and why. At some point I started to question if this explanation was rather a desperate try to justify his way of living in the face of his appearing consciousness. The fail of this reassurance is so well represented by the constantly emerging obstructions. Then the biggest miss gives us the opportunity to see the real talent of Fassbender who is building perfectly this complicated inner crisis. The rest doesn't need any explanation you just have to see it and enjoy it.My initial thoughts were that I needed more depth in the story, but today after I slept on it, I believe that this is a beautiful well-crafted film with a perfect script(full of references and language of a high quality novel) which is more than enough for me. Definitely recommend and I'll personally watch it again.",
    "114": "Following a failed assassination, the hired killer (Michael Fassbender) deals with the fallout and works his way through the chain of individuals involved in the assassination process.The Killer is the long awaited adaptation of the French comic book of the same name by writer Matz and artist Luc Jacamon that had been a pet project of David Fincher's since 2007 when it stalled in development with Paramount and was briefly considered as a reteam for Fincher and Brad Pitt, the latter of whom turned down the role due to how dark the material was. Using his established clout with Netflix Fincher revived the project with Michael Fasbender in the lead. Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker have done a commendable job of taking the tried and true hired killer action template and given us a contemplative and stylish character study that subverts many of the established tropes.Largely eschewing dialogue exchanges, The Killer sees itself primarily based around the inner monologues of the nameless Killer with Fassbender projecting a cool, collected, and detached approach to his ugly line of work with much of the early focus on the tedium the Killer experiences simply waiting for his target to show up. During the long stretches where the Killer keeps himself occupied we get some interesting and engaging insights into his character as he describes his job of killing people with a sense of boredom and ennui where it's mostly a mundane aspect of his life and the only sparks coming from when he's charged with more creative murders. The movie makes no claims that the Killer is anything but a coldhearted murderer with the only real \"kindness\" he provides is murdering someone in a way that will guarantee their children get the life insurance. The film is beautifully shot with Erik Messerschmidt's cinematography doing well in showcasing the various locales The Killer traverses throughout the running time. Those going in expecting something along the lines of a Jason Statham or John Wick movie will be disappointed as there's only one proper action set piece while the actual content of the film is more psychological in execution.The Killer takes a well trodden formula and takes it from a different angle that isn't as explored as more conventional genre fare. For those with an affinity for the likes of Le Samourai, The Driver, and Drive you'll find an engaging and stylish character study that's well-made, thoughtfully written, and engagingly acted.",

If you enjoy endless scenes of a guy sitting in multiple vehicles whilst possessing the ability to not get confused using his multiple IDs whilst crossing many states, countries, all topped off with mindless monotone random monologues then this film is for you. WARNING THE PACE NEVER PICKS UP!Micheal Fassbender is an excellent actor but I think he excepted this script just to keep the light bill on. I was excited to see Tilda Swinton and her character was the only interesting one in the whole of the film itself albeit her graceful moment in this movie wasn't enough that's for sure.I'm all for a decent monologue but the beginning was like a litmus test to see if you'll stay, fast forward or leave. I found the character (The Killer) was giving it large but then missed the intended target. The rest of the film was like a tick sheet exercise and I felt like the ending was anticlimactic, dissapointing and gave one the oh its finished, was that it?

It wasn't. It's about revenge and the narrated inner voice of the do:s & don't:s that we're bombarded with gets old and tiring very fast.To me it felt more like a linear mission in a computer game where the character is just does follows a narrow corridor until the mission is over. I just didn't get it. The guy should be stone cold and apathetic, but he's not, he should be non-conspicuous but he's not, he should be careful and methodical in his every approach, but he's not. Now I'm of course no professional hired hitman but to me it felt like a miracle and highly implausible that he was a experienced pro that hadn't got caught during his +10.000h of work.My main comparison is Leon who lives a quiet loner life, who's somewhat socially inept, who's naive but yet really good at what he does. And we understand his past and how that had shaped him together with the relationship he has with his employer. The Killer had none of that unfortunately. No character arch, no way to relate, or sympathize. No anything.",
    "117": "'The Killer' is a stylish action thriller starring Michael Fassbender as the titular Killer, who goes on a killing spree killing assassins after an attack on his girlfriend. So, this is sort of a vengeance story.Did I say stylish? Ok, that means slow and a bit boring. Did I say 'action thriller'? Well, the action is few and far between. There's quite a bit of narration here, though. Hmmm, did I say 'quite a bit'? Well, actually a hell of a lot throughout the entire movie. In fact, the film's first 15 minutes sees the Killer telling us about statistics, metrics, his life, the meaning of life, his perception of various elements of life, and a bit on politics. Yup, and all the time we watch him watching the building opposite him - as he patiently waits for his target to show up.When the target finally shows up and the moment is perfect for the assassination, the Killer misses his target in a matter of a millisecond, killing a bystander in the process. The Killer immediately senses being followed, and goes on the run using various aliases. When he arrives at his home in the Dominican Republic and finds his girlfriend brutally attacked - but alive - he vows to go after those responsible.Oh, darn, I it happened; I just yawned! Ok, so this film wasn't really boring, but it did move a bit slow, and quite honestly I just didn't find it compelling. It wasn't always clear (to me, at least) who he was after. Yeah, I knew he was after assassins, but it felt like random characters appearing in the film just for a bit of action. Without any background on any of these characters, I simply viewed them as one-dimensional targets.Apart from that, there was very little action. There was ONE chase sequence, and only ONE good fight sequence - which happened to be so dark that I could hardly see what was happening. There never really was a clear antagonist, and no protagonist either. I suppose the film wants us to view the Killer as the protagonist, but I didn't. He was simply the film's lead, and by no means did I see him as a hero. The mere fact that he didn't even have a name - and called The Killer which in itself is negative - didn't really make me root for him; not as I would have wanted to had he in fact been an innocent victim.Michael Fassbender was good in his role, and he is in excellent physical shape. Pity they didn't put his good shape to better use. And all the (repetitive) narration was a bit too much... Oh, and did you also happen to spot all the sponsors in the movie? The movie was like a commercial...",

I found it to be - with certain exceptions - boring and repetitive. So much so that I was tempted to turn it off after only some fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes during which nothing happens (and yes, I know, that was the point of those minutes) with a droning voice-over that made those fifteen minutes seem like hours.Michael Fassbender plays a hired assassin who travels to Paris to kill a man. He fails at his job and so he, himself, becomes the target of those who'd originally hired him. After all, he failed, he knows who hired him .... he's a liability.The rest of the film deals with (a) What those who hired him do in their attempts to kill him, and (b) what he - the assassin - does to escape and wreak vengeance on them.And if this seems like a good film ... well, it's not. It's dark, too dark. The voice-over continues and never becomes any more tolerable. Characters are killed. But not all deserved to die (my opinion), Other characters do not die. And I have no idea why not. I was left cold by the film. I never once knew about whom to care. After all, the vengeful assassin is no boy-scout himself. Like I said, he did kill pretty indiscriminately.Here's my short take. It's Nothing much.",
    "119": "The movie sets the stage quite well. Fasbender's character warns the audience, \"If you are one who is easily bored, this is not the job for you.\" Likewise, this is not the film for you. This is not a \"John Wick\" or \"Equalizer\" action movie. The film, much like the main character, focuses on the little things. The movie will show the mundane activities that we know in the back of our head must be part of the job, but typically we edit out those details.The story of this film is nothing special. It follows all the usual story beats movie's like this use. What makes this movie unique is Fasbender's character and Fincher's directing. Fasbender character is very methodical and detail oriented almost to an obsessive degree. In his own words, he is not spectacular. And it isn't just something that he repeats, we do see him make mistakes and look vulnerable. These small touches go a long way in making the scenes more suspenseful.The movie respects its audience and understand that they have probably seen movies like this before. There are characters who are professionals who are already aware of the clichés, and just accept that this is how things are going to go. They don't dwell too long on tired story moments.Characters that don't play a large role still do a good job of standing out in the limited screen time that they get. Everyone from the cab driver to the gun salesman demonstrate a unique personality.I hope we get more films like this in the future. Not necessarily for the subject matter. But just the simple idea of taking a talented director, a talented actor, a modest budget and letting them make some magic.",
    "120": "After American Psycho, Dexter, House of Cards, and more recently Dahmer here we have yet another white male character music poetically about killing others. To bring it in line with modern times and a certain crowd the words 'grams of protein' and 'survival of the fittest' come up in the same monologue as absolute gems like 'the few exploit the many, make sure you're one the few'.Fasbender delivers yet another ruthless but oh so fascinating more or less creepy stoic character Just like he did in Prometheus, Alien Covenant,Assassin's Creed, Steve Jobs, X Men Apocalypse, Days of Future Past and First Class.Then comes a manhunt I won't get into so as to not spoil it, but you've seen that too countless times already.Maybe it has a spectacularly good ending that makes up for the so-boring-you-could-cry beginning and middle. I don't know, I couldn't stand it anymore and turned it off. Fasbender fans and protein counters who use the word 'alpha' unironically are gonna love it. German tourists not so much.",
    "121": "First of all, I'm a huge fan of Fincher's movies, especially his early ones. His latest ones have not been for me. Mank (2020) was a vanity project for Fincher, and The Killer obviously a vanity project for Fassbender.I certainly wasn't expecting a balls to the wall action movie, that's not Fincher's style. What we got was the worst of Fincher: Style over substance, a simplistic plot and zero characters. Fincher is a lot like Stanley Kubrick and Christopher Nolan in that way. Great visual directors but detached emotionally.The main problem with The Killer is that I don't really care about the character, which also means that I don't care about what happens to him or those supposedly close to him. I suppose the filmmakers would argue that him not letting the audience in is intentional. But that also means that the one thing that supposedly drives the entire movie from the second act - The Killer avenging his girlfriend - doesn't work. Fassbender drones on and on about how empathy is weakness and to trust no one, yet we are supposed to believe he cares about his girlfriend we know absolutely nothing about? John Wick meting out justice to those who killed his puppy makes more sense, however preposterous that may sound, because we have seen that he actually cares about his dog.And as Brian Cox says in Adaptation (2002): \"God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends. God help you. That's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character.\"In its procedural style manner, I guess the one of Fincher's other movies it comes closest to is Zodiac (2007) which, incidentally, is one of my favorites. Some people have compared it to Le Samouraï (1967) with Alain Delon, I personally think it feels more akin to Edward Fox's arc in The Day of the Jackal (1973), a far superior movie.",
    "122": "David Fincher wisely selected Michael Fassbender for his generic titled hitman movie. Fassbender carries it at all times. Title aside this is fascinating hit gone wrong tale. I'm totally uncertain how realistic this might be and that means it's acceptable as it is played out quite morosely. It lives in an old saying, \"those who live by the knife, die by the knife\". By slowly building the drama the viewer invests more and more.Fassbender's Mank character builds his cold lack of humanity until he becomes the hunted causing him to seek a personal vendetta. By the time of Fassbender's failing, and particularly through his detached narrative and sparse dialogue, you have doubt that his unrelenting discipline will see him through.It's quite an achievement when as a viewer you can root for such depravity to, more or less, win. This is because we never know if any of his victims really were so bad and devoid of empathy as he is constantly reminding himself he must be. Mank is almost impossible to like and this is another masterstroke for differentiating a hit man tale like few, if any. Surviving another day is Mank's thing and the proper ending leaves it open for that...or not. An excellent movie that never rushes and keeps the tension building.",
    "123": "Fun isn't a typical word you would use to describe a David Fincher film yet while still displaying his usual tendency for dark and ominous tones, brutal violence and world hating protagonists, Fincher's newest directional outing The Killer is filled with far more fun than you'd initially expect as this darkly comedic assassin outing provides a rip-roaring good time.Teaming up once more with his Se7en screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker, Fincher and his team adapt Alexis \"Matz\" Nolent cult graphic novel of the same name, creating a return to form for Fincher whose last Netflix outing was the disappointing Mank, with the esteemed filmmaker here having a blast exploring the whirlwind world of Michael Fassbender's nameless hitman.As technically astute as you'd expect from a Fincher outing, The Killer is a sleekly produced and proficient thriller, delivered with a whip-smart sheen, from its smartly attuned editing, flawless sound design, memorable DOP work from Erik Messerschmidt and moody score from regular Fincher collaborations Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, The Killer is a ride that never outstays its welcome and provides a quality time while it does it thing.While doing its carefully planned cinematic business, one of the most impressive and refreshing components of the film is the return to form of the films leading man Fassbender, who puts years of below par work behind him with a great turn as a narration happy killer who finds his life thrown upside down by a botched job.One of Hollywood's very best when given the right material to work with, Fassbender is given a lot of weight to carry in Fincher's darkly focused operation but from the moment we join Fassbender on a long-winded European stakeout that includes everything from the musings of death rates through to McDonalds, Fassbender is able to carry this weight with aplomb.Using his natural charisma when needed and showcasing his physicality in one of the years most memorable fight scenes, Fassbender is akin to a hitman for hire version of Dexter Morgan, a man who doesn't understand the belief in human nature but comes face to face his own frailties and desires and while there's not a lot of deepness to be explored in Fincher's unfussy and baggage free feature, Fassbender ensures you're always engaged by our nameless leads journey.Unquestionably lacking the varied layers of Fincher's most revered works such as Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network or the undervalued Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Killer may be more simplistic than some will be desiring but this refreshingly polished Netflix original provides an often thrilling few hours of entertainment and proves once more that Fincher's ability to craft meticulously designed features in mostly unparalleled.Making this a stand-out Netflix original amongst a range of otherwise lacking offerings.Final Say -Moving on from the disappointment of the cancelled Mindhunter series and the forgettable Mank, David Fincher and in-turn his leading man return to form with the fun, fast, unexpectedly pulpy and exciting The Killer.4 misused nail guns out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",
    "124": "Someone commented about 20 years ago that David Fincher had a stroke of genius when he made the movie 'Seven'. I agree with that statement one hundred percent. One of the best movies ever made. Even though it's been 28 years since that movie, every time David makes a new film, my skin is tingling in anticipation. Although in the meantime he didn't deserve that anticipation, obviously, too many years have passed.... I'm old school.This 'The Killer'...I am speechless. Someone lied that 'this' (I will not call 'this' a film) is a new work by David Fincher. It is as if he is a novice amateur, in the first year of the film academy, who is trying to make his first work.'This' lasts almost 2 hours, and 80% of the action takes place in vehicles with the same song as the soundtrack. The voiceover is unbearable, the casting is completely missed. The plot is unbearable. There is no trace of art or the DNA of David Fincher's signature IN THIS.I don't know what happened with David and Hollywood...? There is still a gap of 28 years from his masterpiece 'Se7en'!In any case, it's better not to watch this at all, but instead to walk your dog for 2 hours, cook, read a book, listen to music, etc.. than suffer this.",

    "127": "Michael Fassbender stars in a rather mediocre assassin movie. While the film boasts some commendable action sequences, it falls short of being anything more than average. Early on, the protagonist mentions that the profession demands a great deal of patience and time, which could be interpreted as a subtle warning to the audience about exercising patience throughout the entire viewing experience.The conclusion is notably straightforward, leaving much to be desired in terms of potential improvements. The movie lacks depth and, unfortunately, follows a predictable trajectory with foreseeable outcomes in each subsequent scene.Nevertheless, it's not entirely unworthy of a weekend watch if better options are scarce.And now, I find myself at a loss for words, struggling to meet the minimum character limit without divulging any spoilers.",

Unfortunately, it wasn't for me. And for a number of reasons (Not a huge Smiths fan, but at least that part was tolerable).First of all, the audience has no reason to care about the lead character. He's fastidious in preparation and philosophy, but woefully incompetent in practice. You might have thought that would engender pity, if nothing else. But the snail's pace and the all-too-convenient plot progressions (when they periodically appear) had me looking at my watch far sooner than any audience member ought have to do. I was put in mind of \"The Mechanic\" which also begins quite slowly. But in that film, the filmmakers had the sense to keep Charles Bronson quiet throughout the opening preparations, and not narrate his deep thoughts about life.The existential quandary of a blundering professional killer might have worked if it had been played as parody. The running gag of the fake IDs kind of gives that feeling (after all how can someone who plans so carefully, possibly leave a trail of receipts with the names of 70s and 80s TV stars, and NOT expect to be tracked?). But there's nothing else to indicate humor. Except perhaps unintentionally. There is a ludicrous, dimly lit fight scene with may actually benefit from the audience not really seeing much of it.

This one uses all the clichés but with the disadvantage that this super professional assassin is very stupid, just like everyone else he encounters. The terrible script is full of holes, I won't mention all of them to avoid spoilers, but, for example, this protagonist invades the house of another assassin, 2 times his size, to kill him, just with a pistol, he doesn't even take an extra gun or knife and he almost gets killed. But this protagonist's girlfriend managed to hurt this killer and escape from this huge killer who was still with another killer. In fact, these killers went to kill the super killer at his house in the Dominican Republic by taxi... lol. Not to mention that the agency that hires these killers has the address of all of their homes and they continue to live there...lol. Oh, and the secretary of that assassin agency has the name and address of all the assassins and contractors on little paper cards in her suburban house... in her office, not even in a vault.... that's it.The office that hires dangerous assassins and sometimes orders them to be killed has no security and no armed guards. In fact, these killers break into sophisticated security systems but there is no security at all in their homes... lol. Serious error that is also in John Wick 1.\"Professional\" killers don't realize when they are being followed by car or when there is a car parked in front of their house for hours, with a person inside.The apartment of the millionaire who hired the killer, which the millionaire himself says is the height of security, uses access to the garage elevator and the apartment with a magnetic card without a password. Even in my country town, access from several buildings to the garage elevator already has facial scanning to avoid this.These are just some of the huge inconsistencies that, together with a boring voice over, which adds nothing to the plot, make this film have the most stupid murderers in history.. The first 20 minutes are boring and I just didn't put the film down because of the names involved but I wish I had stopped in the first 10 minutes...\nDavid Fincher like Ridley Scott are great technical directors who are not Authors, they depend on a good script to make good films and they don't always know how to evaluate their scripts.

The problem is that there isn't anything particularly good, or simply good, about The Killer. Nothing ever stands out and that's aggravated by the cardinal mistake that no form of entertainment should be guilty of: being boring. The Killer is indeed a boring film. Not because it's a slow-burn, but because it's really, really flat, with little to nothing ever eliciting any emotions or much engagement at all from the viewer.",
    "135": "The Killer is a thoroughly formulaic story of revenge solely elevated by the specific set of skills David Fincher and his team bring to the material. It's Fincher being self-deprecating in a surprisingly funny and brutal fashion whilst really emphasising how mundane the life of an international assassin would be.Michael Fassbender's killer is a man of few words yet still communicates so much thanks to an ever present voice over which feels so necessary. It gets to the hypocrisy at the core of the film as the Killer constantly reiterates to forbid empathy as all of his actions are motivated by his own attachments.There's undeniably a lot of crossover between character and director here and even if Fincher feels overqualified he is a perfect fit, his methodical direction matching the perfectionist nature of the title character. The highlight being the only fight in the film which is so messy in a way that doesn't feel choreographed but is obviously planned to perfection.The soundtrack provides some of the funniest moments with its mostly Smiths heavy needle drops that are constantly weaving in and out of a subjective and objective point of view. Between those frequent Fincher collaborators Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross work their usual magic to great effect.",
    "136": "The Killer showcases a different, almost more \"realistic\" form of assassin in a world where John Wick and James Bond exists. I appreciate the moments where the character exists within his own head. It is only logical that an assassin would suffer from intense anxiety. However, the film suffers a Netflix death. Im not entirely sure why but it doesnt feel in-depth and of a high standard, its as if Netflix provided enough budget to have the film appear presentable at surface without enough to fuel the rest. Perhaps it just lacks originality. Its a conglomeration of concepts we've seen before and it doesnt accentuate any specific idea to its fullest. If you want a film about a killer on the run, you raise the intensity and provide the sense that that character is being followed. We only get this for a 5 minute period until that idea is flipped on its head. There's absolutely no thrilling sense in the Killer as it's just too slow and lacks any actual attempt at being a thriller. Yet the slowed moments within the film are at times used well. We see the \"protagonist\" analysing locations to prepare for his kill. Yet there is no commentary over these sections relating to details and so the viewer has to use there imagination with no insight.I have played the Hitman games which at a rough description fits the premise of the film quite well. Yet the film simply lacks creativity in comparison. Theres no \"fun\", its bleak at times and boring throughout. I had the patience to sit through it but i didnt want to be there by the end. Michael Fassbender puts in a strong performance but no other character has remotely enough time to become convincing in their roles. Once again its logical that an assassin would be a lone worker but then hes got a second life with a woman who he still remains the same character with. We dont get to see another side to Fassbender's killer but is that just the reality of an assassin? I just feel that Netflix is attempting to appease to this \"sigma\" form of character following the success of their Jeffrey Dahmer serie. This kind of character only works well rarely as becoming used to it removes its uniqueness and i feel as if that has been lost.",
    "137": "As a major fan of Fincher and his regular crew, it saddens me to find this effort fell flat and left no lasting impact. Striking an emotional chord is a forte of our director with works like 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and 'The Social Network' under his belt where character building is flawlessly executed. For 'The Killer', however, it's difficult to connect with our protagonist.The good: an intriguing setup, eery score, and believable skill set from an experienced actor (while maybe not the best choice).The bad: a very unnecessary & snarky narration throughout that greatly impaired the aesthetic, confusing use of music which didn't marry with the story feel or voice of... \"Mr. Killer\" (like constantly taking off and putting on headphones with an edgy, modern rock playlist on a discovery shuffle), conflicting tone of voice and intentions from the lead, no understanding of his personal relationships, and ultimately a lack of stakes for someone who seemingly has little-to-no care for human life.There was a lot of potential with this film and perhaps there's a better version out there somewhere with additional scenes that could clear up some of the many questions the audience likely has walking out of 'The Killer' (such as \"that was it?\" or \"what was the point of that?\"). However, this effort felt rushed and sadly lacked the flavor & gravity of a masterful David Fincher film like 'Fight Club'. Keep your expectations very low, I can almost guarantee they won't be met. 5/10.",

It's Fincher being self-deprecating in a surprisingly funny and brutal fashion whilst really emphasising how mundane the life of an international assassin would be.Michael Fassbender's killer is a man of few words yet still communicates so much thanks to an ever present voice over which feels so necessary. It gets to the hypocrisy at the core of the film as the Killer constantly reiterates to forbid empathy as all of his actions are motivated by his own attachments.There's undeniably a lot of crossover between character and director here and even if Fincher feels overqualified he is a perfect fit, his methodical direction matching the perfectionist nature of the title character. The highlight being the only fight in the film which is so messy in a way that doesn't feel choreographed but is obviously planned to perfection.The soundtrack provides some of the funniest moments with its mostly Smiths heavy needle drops that are constantly weaving in and out of a subjective and objective point of view. Between those frequent Fincher collaborators Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross work their usual magic to great effect.",
    "147": "The Killer showcases a different, almost more \"realistic\" form of assassin in a world where John Wick and James Bond exists. I appreciate the moments where the character exists within his own head. It is only logical that an assassin would suffer from intense anxiety. However, the film suffers a Netflix death. Im not entirely sure why but it doesnt feel in-depth and of a high standard, its as if Netflix provided enough budget to have the film appear presentable at surface without enough to fuel the rest. Perhaps it just lacks originality. Its a conglomeration of concepts we've seen before and it doesnt accentuate any specific idea to its fullest. If you want a film about a killer on the run, you raise the intensity and provide the sense that that character is being followed. We only get this for a 5 minute period until that idea is flipped on its head. There's absolutely no thrilling sense in the Killer as it's just too slow and lacks any actual attempt at being a thriller. Yet the slowed moments within the film are at times used well. We see the \"protagonist\" analysing locations to prepare for his kill. Yet there is no commentary over these sections relating to details and so the viewer has to use there imagination with no insight.I have played the Hitman games which at a rough description fits the premise of the film quite well. Yet the film simply lacks creativity in comparison. Theres no \"fun\", its bleak at times and boring throughout. I had the patience to sit through it but i didnt want to be there by the end. Michael Fassbender puts in a strong performance but no other character has remotely enough time to become convincing in their roles. Once again its logical that an assassin would be a lone worker but then hes got a second life with a woman who he still remains the same character with. We dont get to see another side to Fassbender's killer but is that just the reality of an assassin? I just feel that Netflix is attempting to appease to this \"sigma\" form of character following the success of their Jeffrey Dahmer serie. This kind of character only works well rarely as becoming used to it removes its uniqueness and i feel as if that has been lost.",
    "148": "As a major fan of Fincher and his regular crew, it saddens me to find this effort fell flat and left no lasting impact. Striking an emotional chord is a forte of our director with works like 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and 'The Social Network' under his belt where character building is flawlessly executed. For 'The Killer', however, it's difficult to connect with our protagonist.The good: an intriguing setup, eery score, and believable skill set from an experienced actor (while maybe not the best choice).The bad: a very unnecessary & snarky narration throughout that greatly impaired the aesthetic, confusing use of music which didn't marry with the story feel or voice of... \"Mr. Killer\" (like constantly taking off and putting on headphones with an edgy, modern rock playlist on a discovery shuffle), conflicting tone of voice and intentions from the lead, no understanding of his personal relationships, and ultimately a lack of stakes for someone who seemingly has little-to-no care for human life.There was a lot of potential with this film and perhaps there's a better version out there somewhere with additional scenes that could clear up some of the many questions the audience likely has walking out of 'The Killer' (such as \"that was it?\" or \"what was the point of that?\"). However, this effort felt rushed and sadly lacked the flavor & gravity of a masterful David Fincher film like 'Fight Club'. Keep your expectations very low, I can almost guarantee they won't be met. 5/10.",
    "149": "The killer is more a drama movie then a action or a thriller movie. The high imdb score kinds suprise me.The good? Good actor, some nice landscape shots, realisme in the movies, looked like a professional movie.The bad? Very slow and a too long opening scene, boring script, a lame and boring monologe by the actor, lack off action or something.. anything to happen, bad plot (there is none?).This actor is not made for this kind of movies. He's far better in science fiction movies or movies where a crew can make up the dialoge and he can shine his acting skills.I am not a fan. Only a 5 out of 10."
