    "0": "Five Night at Freddy's was a pretty big letdown. I went in with the expectation to have a pretty scary fun time. Instead what I got was a boring cliche riddled film. Right from the start you can tell this film was geared toward the younger audience. We really don't get much scenes with Freddy and his friends even though they are supposed to be the main attraction here. There is to much setup to the story which is not interesting at all and not enough kills/thrills. Maybe under a different Director or writer this could have turned out to be a more enjoyable experience. Five Night at Freddy's gets a 4 low stars out of 10 from me.",
    "1": "People are overanalyzing this movie as though it's supposed to be a masterclass in acting and screenwriting. It's a \"horror\" movie for children and teens, so take it as it is. It's not trying to be more than that. Kinda like what the Mario movie was. It's a fun time with some funny, suspenseful and heartfelt moments. The acting is average and so is the script, but who cares? I've never played FNAF and know nothing about it, but this movie was a solid time. The blonde police officer was my least favourite part about the movie. She was quite bland with zero personality, and when she was stabbed, it was like, okay, whatever. But I'd watch this movie again.",
    "2": "Listen, this is no cinematographic masterpiece, but it's a good whimsical even sometimes satirical camp movie. I was not worried when different critic pages reviewed it with low scores, because it's not for them...it's for the fans.Do not take it too seriously, let it flow, enjoy the funny effects, have fun with it.Josh Hutcherson and Matthew Lilliard's performances were absolutely amazing. They bring so many good memories and was great to see them perform together.Obviously the movie is setting up for a sequel and we will be seated when it's announced. I just hope there are more little silly jumpscares 🤣",
    "3": "Jesus, anyone giving this a ten wants their head checked.Feels like a wasted opportunity to me, because visually speaking, it was a really strong flick. The way the virtual world was brought to life was brilliant: the costumes, set design, cinematography, etc., were top-notch.But what on earth was going on with the story? Something about a brother being kidnapped and a bunch of 'ghost children' ending up in the robots? I still don't fully get what the hell it was on about.With a better story this could have been a really good film. Also needed a stronger horror element, and more of a 'claustrophobic' feel.It's a shame they didn't go down the route of the game, having the protagonist shut in the security room, trying to keep away from the robots. One of the creepiest things about FNAF is the robots moving without being seen and turning up somewhere else on the security screens, but not once was that used.This film had all the bells and whistles, but it forgets the most important facet: a gripping narrative.",
    "4": "The Five Nights at Freddy's franchise is interesting and while I haven't' followed up with the most recent lore and games, when I was in middle and high school, I really enjoyed playing the game especially the first three as I thought they were fun and had some fun scares. I always like the animatronics designs and I did like the character of Foxy and Freddy. I had known about this movie since the beginning of its development and after being in development hell for years with various directors and writers switching, it is finally out. I knew this movie wasn't going to be some art-house/grand movie and I wanted to watch this for the purposes of having some entertainment and popcorn fun. As a whole, there are some good moments but it's underwhelming.Throughout, the production, setting and the atmosphere is solid as it helps to add the tone of the environment. On the technical aspects, the technical, costumes and effects are great. Especially the animatronic character designs as the character models of Freddy, Chica, Bonnie and Foxy look great. Moments where the animatronics were at play and the characters having to be situated around them, especially the building the fort scene and the group destroying the pizzeria, were pretty good and fun to observe. With the designs from the Jim Henson's Creature Shop, it's impressive and I appreciate them not using CGI on the designs. Including some decent gore effects. Unfortunately, the positive aspects are overshadowed with extremely dull characters and messy plot. The narrative is kind of all over the place as it feels like the writers are trying to shoehorn many ideas together in one and it makes things messy. There are some concepts that I thought were interesting but they were rarely utilized.Honestly, the performances weren't really great. Matthew Lillard's performance was pretty good but the rest of the cast members weren't great, especially some of the child performances. Including the cameos as they felt like they were just there rather than have the cameos be creative. The direction from Emma Tammi was decent but there are certain direction moments that felt sloppy and uneven on certain moments. None of the characters were interesting as they felt uninvesting and too thin to care about while at the same time, they were given some pretty bad dialogue which made things a bit difficult to believe a single word from them. Most of the horror elements feels weak as it is filled with horror cliches and serious moments that sometimes feel unintentionally hilarious. There are some attempts of non-serious tone and humor used but it doesn't work and comes off as forced.The soundtrack was okay and some of the pacing was off which made certain moments pretty boring. I understand this movie is more for the younger audience which is perfect for them but as a whole, it's pretty disappointing since the animatronics are the best part but the movie could have been better. Overall, the fanbase will like this and while I do appreciate the technical aspects, it's not a good adaptation.",
    "5": "\"Five Nights at Freddy's\" is a film that seems to stay faithful to the games, especially in its portrayal of the creepy animatronic characters that capture the eerie spirit of the game's characters. Despite the film not being as bad as some critics suggest, it falls short of being truly impressive. It can be described as a generic, light production that manages to entertain until the end.On the downside, the film is quite moderate in terms of violence and scares. The scares it does offer are mostly predictable and lack the ability to truly terrify, relying on dated techniques. Furthermore, the lack of violence makes it feel somewhat juvenile. The characters in the film come across as somewhat caricatured and unrealistic, particularly the human villains who seem like they're straight out of a 90s teen comedy. The direction also falls short, leaving \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" lacking a distinct identity and failing to cater to both the child and adult audience.",
    "6": "More of a 6.5/10 imo , kind of a casual fan of the franchise but It's an enjoyable movie. Animatronics , and the set are easily the best part . Acting is solid . U just feel bad for Mike , after all he's been through and currently going through with his aunt , not being able to keep a job to support him and his sister . It's kinda hard not to feel bad for him after losing his parents and his brother getting kidnapped. Matthew Lillard prob had the best performance. He did do a really good job imo as William there at the end , but he's barely in it . Ending imo was that good , I just think it woulda been better and more interesting if they didn't turn or he \"still had control of them \" at the end cause of the sequels (which I think their doing) cause now they don't have a legitimate reason to be these killer ghost robots .Even tho I did like the missing kid storyline , I don't get how Abby or any of the ghost kids knew abt it Garrett. They wasn't supposed to have any memory of what happened , so how could they know abt him ? Also I didn't really like Vanessa's. It's not the good type of dislike u want in a movie , but the bad type . She's just not a good written character. She had so many times to tell Mike what happened, but didn't until the end (which is extremely risky and dumb to wait that long ) the actor did a solid job it's just the writing that screwed her. Some of the kills were fine, just they couldn't show much of it cause of the PG13 rating . Which I'm fine with, even tho they woulda definitely benefited from being rated R, I understand their a kids horror franchise and making it go rated R eliminates majority of their fanbase. I can definitely see it being scary to some kids too . This next part is not me critiquing, just a wishlist for the next movie that coulda been in this one. 1 is ofc the bite of 87 scene , and another I wish there was a scene like the first game where the security guard (or Mike ) is just checking the cameras, and constantly closing the doors whenever one of them gets close to it and he has to save the power too. It woulda been really cool to see in live action.",
    "7": "I was pleasantly surprised by this film! It had some great acting and the storyline undertones were just exactly what I needed for a Pre-Halloween fun movie!I would recommend it to fans of the franchise as both of my kids loved it and cited that they were a bit worried if it would carry through to impress them, but in the end, we were all fully entertained!I've never been exposed to FNAF games myself, but have known for years that my kids loved them and for horror game enthusiasts it was a popular franchise. I am happy that the movie didn't disappoint them and caught my attention as well.It's definitely a fun, thrilling family-friendly horror film for gamer fans and movie fans alike!",
    "8": "I'll tell it straight to the point since this is the first review of this movie on IMDB. I'm a big fan of the games - there's some fan service, some really weird scenes I did not expect, and it wasn't scary at all. Completely lacked any jumpscares which, bearing in mind the games are built on them was a bit of a disappointment. I liked the acting and the animatronics were absolutely incredible. Sets were great. Some nods to the silver eyes book and purple guy but no bite of '87. No Markiplier so don't get excited to see him, he's not in it.I'd give it a solid 8/10 since I never thought it'd even see light of day and the atmosphere was spot on.",
    "9": "The Fnaf movie was a rollercoaster of mixed feelings. Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.As someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.",
    "10": "My Background (I think you should know my perspective). (Overall opinion at bottom) (This may be more bloggy than reviewy)I am not a movie critic, and I am not a huge fan of horror movies (of which I believe this movie is not). But I am a movie enjoyer and I am a FNaF fan, this is my point of view.For half my life (I turned 18 the 25th, so 9 years) this franchise has dominated my media consumption. When this movie was first announced in any capacity (A little after FNaF 3 dropped if I remember., 2015). I could not wait. I NEEDED it. Millions of other children like me were ecstatic at the idea of a live action adaptation of the game. If you were like me, you certainly had to have loved this movie (unless you didn't), for the fact it came out at all, that it caters to the community we built for years, and that it was ACTUALLY WATCHABLE. I say it GREAT.My Viewing Experience.I came into the theater terrified that I would walk out disappointed. Fortunately I was very wrong. Of the cameos and obvious pulls from the games, none of it felt very forced (except for the mid credits scene with Cory and Balloon Boy). MatPat's scene at SPARKY'S Diner felt natural, and if I'll be honest I actually didn't clock that it was him until after he said, \"That's just a theory...\". It's honestly a shame Markiplier couldn't make it, I'd have loved to see what they would have done with him.What I think.The story I found to be very enjoyable, with logic working the same way it does in the actual game lore (it doesn't; cops are useless, how is Mike not in custody or at least being questioned about what happened Vannesa? How are Mike or Abby NOT traumatized in any visble capacity? Etc) While to normal movie goers that may be confusing, and for some even outrught bad, to us fans that's just how it is. Is that an excuse to have strange logic? No. But I personally accept it.Ignoring nostalgia (could we even call it that if I'm actively still enjoying the franchise?), this film stands its ground, maybe not as a horror film as previously mentioned, but it certainly is a reasonably structured foundation for, what I can only hope to be, one of many great films.Why It Didn't Need To Be Scary.I understand that the horror game adaptation SHOULD be scary. But tell me honestly, did you really, ABSOLUTELY need to see some absurdly graphic deaths in this film to make it have an impact on you? The games themselves aren't all that scary, most of us diehard fans are adults at this point. A few jumpscares are just not enough to make us cry and run away anymore. Is the storyline in the film still mature, such as the game's lore? Yes. Is it conveyed to us in a similar fashion (Mostly indirectly, like the minigames)? Yes.Why Some Claims Are Baseless (In my opinion).Ultimately this is THE FNaF movie. It is made within reasonable expectation, and those who complain about lack of gore, supposed lack of faithfulness to the actual lore, and other honestly minor details (animatronic eye colors), are viewing this movie in the wrong way.Uncategorized Rambles I Want To Put Out There.Let me tell you, if they turned this into some kind of action-adventure type deal, that would've been pretty cool. Imagine the final \"fight\" (I will be referring to it as that) being a full on brawl between Afton (who ABSOLUTELY needed more screentime, I LOVED the final fight) and the gang. In my mind that sounds AWESOME.I actually started to tear up when I heard the FNaF Song start playing for the credits. With how ingrained that song is in my mind and how it has influenced my tastes in music (and humor if you ask my friends) it was honestly impossible not to feel something with how important it is to me.Overall...At the end of the day, the story is interesting, it's a nice separation between game and movie. The characters are all quite good (I really need to see more William). The acting is noticeably off in some places, especially with the child actors, and Abby talks really weird for a child. The cameos, references, and Easter eggs do not carry the film, which is a GOOD thing. To reiterate, this movie stands its ground as a film and does not disappoint.My mom's point of view (a horror fan): To a non-FNaF, horror fan, this film is very much for younger audiences (not children, but not adults), but not a bad film.A stance which makes sense to me.8/10, Holds the most value to me in my heart.He Always Comes Back.",
    "11": "I'll preface this review by saying I have not played any of the games and barely know the plot. I knew it was about animatronic robots who try to kill the security guard and you play as security but that's pretty much my knowledge. I do not know if the movie did the games justice.Having said that, this movie was boring af. The age rating really ruined it. It would have been a banging movie if there was more blood, gore, death, violence, etc. Most of the violence was too tame or implied, and the deaths happened off screen. It needed more \"80's slasher\" vibes.Lillard was awesome as always though.",
    "12": "Five Nights at Freddy's had the potential to be a standout horror film, but it ultimately falls flat in execution. Despite being billed as a horror movie, the PG-13 rating seems to hinder its ability to deliver genuine scares. The film struggles with its identity, wavering between psychological horror, mystery, and slasher genres without committing to any. This lack of direction leaves the audience with a sense of confusion and disappointment. In theory, it could have been something significant, but in reality, it ends up as a basic and forgettable attempt at the horror genre.A Missed Opportunity\"",
    "13": "Wow this wasn't good in the slightest. First off it took 40 minutes before anything happened and the story was so forced and hard to care about. I didn't play the games because they never interested me so idk if this is supposed to be a part of the story but wow was it a terrible story. The plot was so poorly thought out and cringy with almost no horror aspects at all. I thought it was supposed to be a horror movie, which from what I understand is what the video games were, but it ended up being a mystery movie kind of. The acting is horrible and the screen writing didn't help them. The interactions between the characters are so unrealistic and their emotions are so random and extreme. One character is so unnecessarily secretive it's frustrating. I'm really sorry if you're a fan of this franchise and I know you probably really want to like this movie but be realistic about it. It was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The only reason I didn't rate this 1 or 2 stars is because the animatronics look really good, for the VERY limited time you see them.",
    "14": "With Willys Wonderland. I played the games and this has nothing to do with the games it does have some call backs towards the beginning when Lilliard is talking to him over the phone and what not but the rest was pretty much changed the whole looking for his brother thing that is missing is taken up more the screen time then the actual Freddy's. Instead of them hunting down and murdering them soooo far they are just hanging out with them. They figured out the dead kids are possessing the animatronics. Now they are all building a fort together.. 1 hour 13 mins in and he is now back to watching the security screens. Nope he is falling asleep trying to dream about his missing brother some more.. yawn.. All the little kids in his dreams again who are possessing the animatronics, tell 'em you want to know about your brother you got to sacrifice Abby to the animatronics. More dreaming him just yelling while little kids run around him, they start to slice him up. He wakes up to the animatronics trying to put a mask on him. Hour 18 mins in and he finally gets chased by one of the animatronics. This movie is baaaaad I'm stop my review there cause I don't know if I can even finish it.",
    "15": "Everything about this film was terrible, I struggle to find positive things to say about it outside of cinematography. The characters were moronic and unbelievable, it had nothing you want from a five nights at Freddy's movie(No mystery, intrigue, no jumpscares) and instead decided to waste its time on an annoying child and a whiney man who couldn't emote if his life depended on it.I just can't help but think this movie should have been a crime mystery movie, imagine a story where you follow a detective investigating missing children and that eventually leads him onto William aftons trail and freddy's. Something more akin to Seven than whatever the hell this trash movie was.",
    "16": "Started off slow, but the pacing was more or less the usual for a horror film. Although it was more of a thriller than a horror in my opinion. Probably because the movie was rated a 15. It was not scary at all yet it made you feel creeped out. Vanessa being Williams daughter is a bit confusing to the games lore, as well as Mike not actually being Williams child also. It got a bit childish when all the animatronics team up with Abby to make a fort. I felt disappointed that the movie went towards that direction. I wanted a scare, but all in all the movie was not actually too bad. It was visually brilliant, with the animatronics looking spot on compared to the game, but the plot just needed quite a bit of work. The visuals were worked on more than the storyline, a big let down for someone as myself who has been waiting 10 years for the film and has been a long time fan of the franchise. I was sad to see that Markiplier is indeed NOT in the movie, but I hope to see him in the second. Although a couple of other youtubers did make appearances.",
    "17": "I'll start by saying I don't know much about this franchise. My review is from an outsiders prospective. The PG-13 rating really hurts FNAF here. I understand they were trying to appeal to a broader audience, but this film has no scare factor whatsoever. If it was a gorefest, it could at least add some horror elements to make up for everything else this movie does wrong. The kills are mostly offscreen/ ineffective. The plot is weak, and laughably bad in almost ever way. Especially when it comes to these protagonists desicions.The movie is a slog fest. The animatronics basically take a back seat in their own franchise, which is a shame because the look of the animatronics is the only good thing about this snooze fest.",
    "18": "I went in with high expectations for this film and I truly believe it was so much better than I imagined. They really brought the games to life. There were twists and oh my god moments when watching, plus there were many other themes highlighted in the film not just the pizzeria which I really enjoyed, it kept the film more real, maybe more relatable.I'd like to have known more about what happened after but I'm not too fussed with that as there most likely will be a sequel that ties loose ends.Watching this brought so many memories of me playing the games when I was young, young me was jumping in my seat, it felt like young me and present me really connected.",
    "19": "Y'all. The critics are such idiots for the ratings they've given this absolute masterpiece of a movie. As a long-time fan with a very in-depth knowledge of the lore and the story, this movie did not disappoint, besides the fact that it had to end!! I loved it from beginning to finish, I loved the added lore and the depth of the characters, from Mike to Vanessa to even Max. The cinematography was incredible, the sets were GORGEOUS (especially the pizzaria), the score was wonderful, acting was great even with the kiddos, and man oh MAN those animatronics. Makes me shudder knowing that they're out there, somewhere . . .Also- the jumpscares, man. I went insane every time even when I could tell that they were coming. Terrifying but in an amazing way.LOVE LOVE LOVE, and any fan will too! (:",
    "20": "It felt like it was an action movie at times, if it wasn't for its ties with the games which were good the film would be very bad. The fan service made the film worthwhile. Storyline felt rushed and incomplete. The big ending one of the most impactful and significant events seemed brushed over and honestly not amazing, it felt rushed aswell as over simplified. Cameos and fan service was enjoyable but that's what they're there for. If it wasn't for them it wouldn't be enjoyable as characters motives are weak and change with little influence. The entire premise was weak with how we interacted with the animatronics.",
    "21": "While the Jim Henson Company did a great job with the animatronics, they are utterly wasted and contribute no scares to the film whatsoever. The plot, so to speak, is spread throughout the runtime and is predictable at every turn.If you were expecting the movie to imitate the tone and content of the games, you'll be largely disappointed beyond a few names and easter eggs.If you were expecting decent spooks, plotting, or performances, you'll be more disappointed still.Matthew Lillard chews the scenery in each of his (too few) scenes and is far and away the standout. An anthology of shorts - perhaps tied together through Lillard's character - would have allowed for better scares and more closely resembled the source material.",
    "22": "We sure didn't since we have Peacock. Simply one of the most laughable horror movies of all time. All the deaths except for one are off screen. Least that we saw since we FF it after a mind numbing hour of nothingness with only a couple of ludicrous deaths. There is no horror except of course having to watch this in a theatre. The laughable monsters are so ridiculous looking that I couldn't stop laughing. Josh is no leading man material and to see his boring countenance nearly the whole movie is unbearable. How this made so much money opening weekend is mystifying but hey I watched tons of awful movies when I was a teenager myself. There are no scares, no good effects; certainly no good deaths. I expect a precipitous drop next week in the box office. Awful awful awful.",
    "23": "I know it's written by the creator and it's based on the franchise but it's about as scary as a Smurf baking a cake. Firstly I assumed it be broken into five nights with a simple new security guard who has more intense violent encounters each night. But it just seemed like they were trying to hard for such a great idea. No idea why it was a 15 rated movie. Seriously though it had potential and looked like an episode of Doctor Who which can be scary but I expected more. Horror movies have really gone soft since 2000 and this is no exception. I really enjoyed the directing, the characters design and the acting I was just let down by the writing and probably the studios desire to not make it 18 rated.",
    "24": "Absolutely not worth the cinema experience I can tell you. And look, I'm generous when it comes to rating movies sometimes...so I gave it a 2. IT WAS SO BAD, don't get me wrong I like fnaf ,not like those obsessed fans though. So all the ratings you see here with like above 6 stars, they're absolutely too obsessed to even notice the cringy scenes.Hats off to the guy who made the movie trailer, that was impressive, nothing like the movie though.I'm not so hard to scare, couldn't even go past night 3 on the mobile game so when I say this was like a walk in the park, believe me. I didn't even jump once...\nDamn, I could've made a better movie... mmm... maybe someday...",
    "25": "As a fan of the franchise I can confirm that this movie is absolutely fantastic, I'm pretty critical when it comes to movies but yet I still absolutely loved the movie. I do have some small complaints though, one of the complaints I have is I hoped to see more of William Afton in the movie but besides that I'm very happy with what we received from this movie. I actually understand why critics rated this movie low, and that reason is that they aren't fans of the franchise. If you have always been a fan of this franchise then you will likely love this movie, overall I'm super excited to see the second movie when it releases!",
    "26": "This movie was a HUGE disappointment. Five Nights at Freddy fan or not you will be massively confused as to what is even going on. The film is very disjointed and the half assed story was poorly conveyed and extremely Cliché. If you are thrilled by the power of friendship saving the day you will love this movie. If you love a comedic PG adaptation of one of the most horrific stories of child murder and possession you will also love this movie. But if you love to watch quality movies with tonnes of care put into them, containing an original and engaging story, maybe go watch netflix instead.This film could have easily been improved if it wasn't desperately trying to target 7 year olds, despite most pf the fanbase being adults or in their late teens by now. It should have been an origin story for the animatronics, not a romantic comedy, teen, summer fun loving movie.Biggest disappointment in a while.",
    "27": "Not easy porting a lot of gaming moments from the games into this movie. But somehow it's fun with a good back story. The core of the games is still very well represented.The brother and sister storyline is solid The whole story how the robots are being controlled was a nice spin on things. And everyone did a solid job.No doubt Blumhouse badly want this to succeed I hope it does because it deserves a sequel to carry on the story. There's a lot they could do here.Overall this was some serious fun , pure popcorn wasn't heavy on gore so no doubt Blumhouse will do an unrated cut . Megan would play well with these new friends.",
    "28": "My kids have been begging to watch their first horror film and I haven't been able to allow it cause they're all awkwardly sexual. Finally a film that has a story line that makes sense, and isn't full of innapropriate romance scenes.The story line itself is pretty good, and the jump scares are enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. The acting is on parr and i think they just did a really good job. My kids who love the fnaf game said there were so many good nods to the games, and were excited to watch it. All in all, a pretty good movie and a good movie for your first horror film if you're a kid.",
    "29": "The story for this movie is inept. Instead of just using the idea of kid friendly animatronics going hay wire and running amok, they went with this complex paranormal murder mystery story. I get that this is based on the graphic novels and not the games lore, but that doesn't justify this movies poor plot. There's very little horror and action. The characters spend most of their time chatting and arguing. It wasn't towards the end where it started feeling the games where the animatronics turn hostile and began attacking the human characters. Mathew Lillards character Afton is a poorly written villain. He only appeared in three scenes and just pops up in the end and we're supposed to be shocked that he was the children's killer. There were no hints or buildup at all to him being the killer but the character Vanessa reveals that she's his daughter and tells us everything we need to know about what her Dads crimes right before he comes out to kill Mike. It's also worth pointing out that Vanessa's last name is Kelly and she doesn't even have the last name as her Dad. Which is why we never saw the daughter plot twist coming. It also doesn't make sense how exactly Afton has control over the children's ghosts and is able to manipulate them into killing. In his final scene, Afton realizes that he's about to get his comeuppance from the animatronics and yells out \"I always come back!!\" For some reason the plot tries to make Afton out to be some kind of supernatural villain who can't be killed. It also doesn't make sense how the animatronics didn't know that Afton was the killer. Mikes little sister Abby had to draw a picture to explain to them that Afton was their killer to turn against him. I also can't figure out why Afton hired Mike as the night guard for his restaurant. I thought perhaps he wanted to lure him in there so he could kill him in privacy. But if that's the case then why did he wait five nights to do it? He also berates his daughter for failing to keep everything a secret from Mike and refusing to kill him if he found out the truth. Which makes me doubt that killing him himself was his motive.",
    "30": "My son was obsessed with the games back in middle school and I watched a good bit of the game play. Now as an 18 yr old saw he saw it a couple of nights ago. He had a good review so I watched it on Peacock, we both agree visually it was flawless 10/10 and if you're familiar with the storyline in the games it does follow it but adds more to it to flesh it out, also for the original fans there are a lot of Easter eggs dropped in as well as fan work such as the music came from fans, he said you could tell the true fans in the theater when a song played and half the theater cheered simply because they recognized and added it. I liked the keeping with the main story and was so so with the added bits. If you loved the games there's a lot to like but if you are unfamiliar and just are watching as a stand alone movie you probably won't like it as much. Over all he gave it a 9/10, I gave it a 6-7/10.",

I guess I'm one of few that loved Five Nights at Freddy's which is fine that's common with me I have I autism I enjoy a lot of movies most don't as much, plenty of my favorites are guilty pleasures. Anyways I love how this reminded me of 3 other movies Sinister which is masterful but much darker than Five Nights at Freddy's, the other 2 are Scream and Nightmare on elm street the Similarities are brilliant plus I don't know much about the video games I'm pretty sure the director perfected everything based on the games. The terror is great, story flows well, cast is superb, comedy is awesome, and to me a lot of the movie is spectacular!",

He gets a job and attacks a poor guy whithout asking what was going on, then he gets another job and sleeps all night instead of guarding what he was hired to guard, and on top of that brings his sister (who btw is young enough to be his daughter) along for no other reason than to cover for him not doing his job....The dream stuff is just pure nonsense and only serves to slow the story and feels like it was a fea pages pulled from another script....just no.",

    "34": "First off I would like to say I have never played the games but I watched the game theory videos when I was younger and thought the lore was interesting but never got too into the franchise. Despite this I genuinely enjoyed the film. The horror in the film is more like security breach where there are jump-scares but they are very predictable and not too scary. The plot is really where the movie shines, it's surprisingly sweet and had me hooked. The ending could have been better and felt rushed but thats only the real part that felt that way and everything else was great. There is so much here for longtime fans of the franchise and I think that you will really enjoy this if you love the games. \"Tl;dr\" critic reviews made it seem terrible when it's not that bad.",
    "35": "I've never been that crazy of five nights at Freddy's . But I know some kids and high school students talk about it. My young cousin who lives in Florida is a crazy fan of five nights at Freddy's . After seeing this movie tonight I say it was really awesome and crazy wild with loads of fans kids , teenagers , and young adults like myself. The story was so incredible and very wild and it did have some intense moments where one is the people got cut in half by Freddy fuzzbear, foxy really had a way with stocking her victims , chica really knows how to find ways of winning a fight . The rest of the characters from five nights at Freddy's were really awesome , scary and uh very intense robots . William who was dressed as the yellow bunny was so crazy . I hope they do a directors cut where they're more scenes and hopefully and alternate ending .",
    "36": "So the only three characters that are interested was Mike & Abby Schmidt, Vanessa Monroe (COP) and Aunt Jane. The horror was darker tone to it and it wished it went an Hard R Rated horror that way it would of made more sense.Coming out of watching the film last night, I have to say that this film does not meet the expectations that I had as a fan. It is worth saying that the film was not awful, but I had felt that it gave the impression that the script was rushed and very choppy to say the least. The film failed in the aspect that it was more focused on appealing to the general audience, however this is a huge weakness of this film, rather than sticking to the original material( which is difficult, especially it is a video game) the film feels like a huge jumbled mess of cameos. Unfortunately I was wrong. I knew that it would be very unlikely (and probably difficult) to follow directly to the lore. The movie had aspects from the lore but it just felt all jumbled together, especially the 'I always come back' scene, kind of cheesy and it felt forced. The movies storyline was rather random, bringing in two random characters which make no sense. The only good things about it was with the animatronics design and how the end with spring bonnie entering but just a heads up for those who have not watched it. DO NOT WATCH IF YOU ALREADY KNOW THE LORE, THE WHOKE AND LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS. It does not link to lore at all. The story was off track and had security breach and FNAF 1 together. Two different time periods, two ends of the spectrum literally. The acting was amazing imo, but that was about it. The \"Springlock\" scene was super hype at first but as it continued it was so demoralising. It was more like an PG horror back in the 70's towards early mid 80's. So, the entire theatre/streaming services like peacock was making jokes about it, laughing, and overall mocking the film because it was so childish. Most people had dressed up for the occasion but only ended up ruining it with the shouting of matpat showing and shouting over the iconic lines and just chucked them all in at random points. I respect the actors for they did amazing but the script did them not justice throughout the film and had led them to not having the praise they deserve. They went away the aspect of being able to see them and to only see how the tracing back to his dreams at those moments. The advertising and hype for the movie but shows that it had none of realism of the games have and not having all the iconic moments when they were necessary. The fact that springtrap under going the springlock with not much blood or gore and the fact that it had happened then just went over and gabbed the mask before saying 'i will always come back' and just carried on and getting dragged away. It gave no context on the pain that would have been shown. They could have stuck with the lore and not try to focus on a hidden message. It most certainly did not deliver the hype & expectations of the audience whatsoever, despite stating on news interviews that they have delivered what the fans would want, I beg to differ. There was barely any soundtrack or sounds linked to the games which might have made the experience better or might have been able to add more context for the fans to appreciate. The only noticeable sound or song which was in the film was living tombstone which only appeared right at the end. The movie had aspects from the lore but it just felt all jumbled together, especially the 'I always come back' scene, kind of cheesy and it felt forced.The movies storyline was rather random, bringing in two random characters which make no sense? Abby/Abbie (I don't know what way it's spelt) there was absolutely no point in her, making the film corny with the 'oh I see ghosts and they're my friends!!😆' trope and don't even get me started on the table scene. I get that it was just some fun and all, but it just didn't feel like FNAF. In the game lore Mike was William's son so even if that link was made it would've been better. Also random point but it would've been cooler with some gore, like an actual springlock scene or being stuffed inside a suit since those are big things in the games.Maybe I'm just being too critical but I guess I'm just mildly disappointed. I'm sure some people loved the film and fair for them! Everyone has their own opinions. I just feel like it could've been written a lot better rather than a film which was trying a little too hard to appeal to fans with the mushed up storyline, when it had so much potential. (Literally could've just watched a few game theory videos and followed that story and it would've been a lot better.) The movie did have some good things to it, like the few Easter eggs (sparky was cool!) and also the cameo appearances were cool, like the living tombstone song at the end! The Animatronics were very well made too! The actors did a good job as well. To be honest even if they did make a sequel, I'd still watch it. I'll always love FNAF and just hope that if there was another movie it'd be better.The end of the day, I hated when we get like off screen kills just a plan shadow, it does frustrates that intention, Willy's Wonderland was a better film because Nick Cage does not use dialogue in this film only screams and yells, The Banana Spilts Movie was similar because animatronics was designed differently and when the computer system was created an demonic animatronics then it did have on screen kills. If you really want to watch something without dialogue watch Willy's Wonderland (Skip Five Nights AT Freddy's). If you wanted to watch something that talks about the last performance with animatronics and a demonic computer hack system and went on a decent path, watch The Banana Splits Movie (Skip Five Nights AT Freddy's). This is a 3/10 it's not like I hated the movie with hot relish and/or two hours lost it did however have positive factors but nothing that would make me feel enjoyable.",

    "38": "When I first started watching the movie, it drew me in with its visuals and intrigue. However, when I reached the end of the film, I truly couldn't believe how poorly they concluded it.First of all, the makeup, costumes, and visuals were quite good. But apart from that, the other elements were not satisfying at all.I couldn't understand why they tried to commercialize the script. The idea of finding children's spirits inside robotic monsters was just unbelievable. Also, the character Vanessa, who didn't do her job throughout the film but was only involved in the events because her father was in charge, really dragged the film down. Let me first address what I initially mentioned. Whoever came up with the idea of searching for his brother in a dream and communicating with the child spirits inside robotic monsters did a really bad job. Instead of turning this into more of a detective thriller and strengthening the family drama (now I'm moving on to the second point, Vanessa), they gave Vanessa's character a very simple and elementary-level script connection to her father, William Afton. The absence of police in the events or the incomplete presentation of any mystery element is a total disaster for the film. Like I said, if they had turned this material into a detective-style thriller, they would have created a much stronger film.In short, the movie,although visually beautiful, was ruined by an unsuccessful script that tested my patience and tried to be meta but couldn't. You can see this from the ratings on all movie review sites. Our time is precious and this movie is not worth it.",
    "39": "Five Nights At Freddy's sounded fun at first. A comedic horror film with killer robotic animals. It's like chucky cheeses murder style!!!! Well I hate to say this but, this movie isnt how I expected it to be! Everyone in this film was good with performances! Some moments are just plain stupid. For my personal opinion, It's an unfunny, non scary, horror film that tries too hard to be scary and funny! It's good for younger people bc it's not intense but this movie was flat as anything for me and extremely boring. I feel bad for the actors bc trying to be scared of robotic teddy bears and crap is RIDICULOUS!",
    "40": "This movie put me to almost to sleep. The main character was asleep for half of the movie reliving the same dream which is boring. The cop lady was saying the weird things. She said she can't help him but yet come and saved his ass without even struggling with the fact that the person he was gonna have to shoot is her dad.The main character said at once point that the cop was scared in the back room when they were there cause he saw it in her eyes but yet the actor didn't look scared at all.Feel like all of the plot points ended in a weird way.For example aunt wanting the girl for money. It ended by having animatics kill the aunt then try to take the girl.The plot overall was boring, weirdly done and not in a good way.",
    "41": "I'm one who read the books and played the gameSomeone decided they should combine the 2. Why? I have no idea. Perhaps they saw the Nick Cage movie and decided they needed to keep elements of the game in it.The book itself is really good, from the child killer to the possessions, to the main girl's backstory. But they removed it all to fit in a main character who is a security guard for 5 nights (like the game).They kept the elements of the book with the serial killer and instead of a female lead with a tragic loss of a brother, the security guard has that. It's interesting how they decided to play it.All in all it's not perfect, but it isn't bad. I think the picture drawing parts were weird...and the jump scares were cheap. I will say the ending of the book series is awful, so this is a nice compromise.",
    "42": "If you have zero knowledge about the games this is a nice watch (if you don't think much), however if you do it will be both confusing an disappointing (Do still watch it though),Firstly, all the characters and family relationships are really mixed up, all of William Afton's motives for killing children is gone. For some reason Vanessa is William's daughter instead of Mike, who had his younger brother Garrett (supposedly CC) kidnapped (what?!?) and is taking care of his sister Abby (who?!?). What I mean is fnaf has very (VERY) deep and confusing lore, but the writers had Scott to ask questions, there were a lot of good stories opportunities about what is already known about the stories (like following mike going from restaurant to restaurant, etc).Even if you don't know the franchise, there are a lot of plot holes, like the five children are in the animatronics (freddy, bonnie, chica, foxy, and I guess cupcake?), but where did Garrett go? Why are some children in animatronics and other not. Also, why would William want to employ Mike? He had no reason to kill him, is it just for fun orrr???I enjoyed the movie, the acting is nice and its well filmed, it isn't scary, but it's not bad. It went above my expectations (they were really low), except in that one scene where the animatronics are all laying down in the \"tent\", that was the only real horror in the movie... Anyways, I think Mike is a good character, but Vanessa is useless and only there for exposition and \"HE IS MY FATHER!!!\".I say watch it and make your own opinion about it.",
    "43": "Creating a story in the context of a franchise like FNAF should have been a relatively straightforward task, given the rich lore and established characters. However, it appears that the creators managed to falter in significant ways. While the visual elements of the movie, such as the scenery and costume designs, were commendable to some extent, these superficial aspects should have been just the tip of the iceberg.The fundamental issue lies in the mishandling of the established lore and the names of the characters. FNAF already possesses a complex and intriguing backstory, and it is disappointing to witness how the film failed to honor and expand upon it in a meaningful way. Instead of capitalizing on the well-established universe, the creators appear to have disregarded it, leaving fans and enthusiasts deeply unsatisfied.Vanessa's character, purportedly intended to lead a suspenseful narrative, was one of the movie's glaring disappointments. Her portrayal lacked depth and substance, rendering her unable to effectively carry the weight of the story, ultimately resulting in a dramatic failure.Additionally, the movie's pacing left much to be desired. A well-constructed horror narrative relies on a careful balance between tension and release, but it seems that the film failed to strike this equilibrium. The result was a viewing experience that felt disjointed and lacked the necessary buildup and payoffs expected from a FNAF adaptation.In conclusion, it is regrettable to witness the mismanagement of such a promising concept. While the visual elements demonstrated some effort, the core elements of storytelling and character development fell far short of what the FNAF franchise and its dedicated fanbase deserved. The film's shortcomings raise questions about the decision-making processes involved in its creation and the missed opportunity to create a compelling addition to the FNAF universe.",
    "44": "I was sitting in theaters watching the flabby ford fiz gang and there was a scene where Fraddy Fizzbor Fazzed all over the screen, it really felt like he fazzed all over me and my friends (my schizophrenic medication isn't working). I loved the nude scene with the cupcake too, it felt like the frosting really went in my mouth! And at the end Oppenheimer dropped his nuke on the pizzeraria and I loved seeing the flabby ford fizzington gang get obliterated by the atomic bomb.That is why I put it at 9 stars.But honestly it was a really great movie and I would rewatch it any day. I gotta go my grandma's calling me up from the basement (my Freddy fazbear cave) to go eat hotpockets. See ya!",
    "45": "Five Nights at Freddy's, the highly anticipated adaptation of the popular video game series, has finally made its way to the silver screen. As a big fan of the original games, I approached this release with great enthusiasm, hoping for a bone-chilling, suspenseful experience that would do justice to its gaming origins. However, much to my dismay, this cinematic endeavor left much to be desired. Despite a few redeeming qualities, I regret to say that the final product only deserves a 4/10 rating.The film, directed by a promising newcomer in the industry, had the potential to be a horror masterpiece. The premise, which centers around a security guard surviving nights at a haunted animatronic-filled pizzeria, was ripe for suspense and terror. Sadly, it fell flat in execution, leaving me longing for the scares that never came.One of the biggest disappointments of Five Nights at Freddy's was the lackluster character development. The film introduced a cast of intriguing characters, from the tormented security guard to the mysterious animatronics. However, their potential was squandered, and we were left with underdeveloped, two-dimensional figures who lacked depth and personality. We needed a reason to care about their fates, but it never came.Moreover, the film's pacing was sluggish. While the games are known for their slow-building tension, the movie felt like an interminable waiting game, much like the protagonist's nightly vigil. Instead of suspense, we were subjected to long stretches of monotony, punctuated by occasional, tepid jump-scares that failed to evoke the heart-pounding fear we hoped for.Speaking of jump-scares, this is where the film truly faltered. The jump-scares were lukewarm at best. In a horror movie, these moments should be used to jolt the audience out of their seats, leaving them breathless and terrified. Unfortunately, Five Nights at Freddy's seemed to mistake repetition for effectiveness. The animatronics' predictable and lackluster appearances drained the film of any shock value. It was a missed opportunity to genuinely scare the audience.The film's lack of innovation in its presentation was a significant letdown. While the source material is known for its unique and eerie atmosphere, the movie failed to capture that same sense of dread. The pizzeria, a central element of the story, felt uninspired, and the film lacked the creepy ambiance that made the games so unsettling. The creators could have drawn inspiration from the games to create a more immersive and visually arresting experience, but it felt like a wasted opportunity.Five Nights at Freddy's also suffered from a disjointed and incoherent narrative. The film hopped between different time periods and perspectives, leaving viewers confused and detached from the story. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to cram too much of the game's lore into a single film, resulting in a messy and convoluted plot. It was difficult to invest in the story when it lacked cohesion and clarity.The film's visuals, while decent, failed to stand out in the crowded genre of horror. The animatronics, despite being a central element of the story, looked more comical than terrifying. The use of practical effects was commendable, but their execution left much to be desired. A sense of eeriness and uncanny valley realism was missing, leaving a significant void in the horror department.One aspect of the film that did shine was the soundtrack. The haunting and discordant score created an atmosphere of unease, which was one of the few elements that managed to maintain the tension in certain scenes. The music, composed by a talented artist, was a testament to the film's potential, but it alone couldn't salvage the entire project.In the end, Five Nights at Freddy's was a missed opportunity in the world of horror cinema. With the right direction, character development, pacing, and innovative presentation, it could have been a genre-defining masterpiece. Unfortunately, it fell short of those expectations, delivering a lukewarm experience that left me yearning for the true terror and suspense that the source material promises.In conclusion, the film was a disappointment to fans of the game series and casual moviegoers alike. It lacked the necessary elements to make it a compelling and truly horrifying experience. With a more skillful adaptation, it could have been a standout entry in the horror genre. However, as it stands, Five Nights at Freddy's deserves a 4/10 rating, reflecting its inability to fulfill its potential and deliver the scares that audiences were hoping for.",
    "46": "This movie was hands down one of the worst, most boring films I've ever paid to watch. No plot, no intense scenes, no horror scenes. Everyone in the movie has no common sense and the little girl is literally a moron. The little girl becomes beasties with the animatronics, how stupid. Average acting. He man lives in a good house but is broke. They had some humor but it was short lasting. The plot of the movie too its sweet time developing. The movie is so low and the movie it's even focused on the robots and the original lore. If you are a five nights at Freddy's fan, do not waste you time and money on this movie.",
    "47": "I usually like the cheap and cheerful Blumhouse movies but this one properly sucks. A really terrible story that is totally pointless and feels like it was made up in the fly, terrible dialogue, cheap special effects and worse of all its not at all scary, how this got a 15 certificate I'll never know!! I was happy to see Matthew Lillard get a big screen movie as it seems like ages since I've seen him In anything, after this I think it'll be a while before he's back on our screen, awful performance. This is the worst film I've seen in ages and the first one I actually considered walking out of. This film is soooo bad it should have been shown at thanksgiving. Do yourself a favour and avoid this turkey.",
    "48": "Why does it look so much like another fnaf fanfiction? In these phrases there is nothing recognizable from the original series, except perhaps the animatronics themselves, as if this film is trying hard to seem like canon, but it's not him. And judging by the introduction, I can already say that this film will be a weak thriller of category B for the young target audience of fnaf, BRAVO SCOTT!!It was once a horror, but it became a children's entertainment, because it is more profitable to work for a children's audience...The ending where Steve Raglan (William Afton) dies from spring locks in a springbonnie suit is literally taken from Scott Cawton's 2017 book silver eyes, but unlike the book version, where the suit slams shut because he was pushed away by the main protagonist Charlie, whom he took hostage, then in the film spring locks are triggered from for the fact that an animatronic cupcake jumps on Springbonnie, biting off part of the belly of the suit and touching these springs...... What a cringe......The villain himself, William Afton, did not seem interesting to me from the word at all, an ordinary sadist. For the children's audience for which this film is designed, it may work, but as a character it is empty and simplified.The costumes, especially the Springbonnie costume, look worse than many fan cosplay costumes. I mean, William Afton's suit looks bulky, carelessly made, as if the designers did not even try to make a nice costume design, and the material from which it is made looks like some kind of sponge.The pizzeria itself, especially the office, has absolutely no atmosphere of the first part, and looks cardboard. In fact, everything in this movie looks hastily done. As if the creators abandoned this project for years and after a long time decided to make a film with the most simplified story and collect money from the youngest audience.I'm not waiting for a sequel or prequel, because as a true fan of the series, I don't want to suffer seeing how fnaf buries itself deeper into the grave. Not that I expected some very atmospheric and dark thriller with a very charismatic film adaptation of William Afton, but in my opinion it turned out to be the worst option.",
    "49": "This movie was absolutely incredible. It follows the storyline to the original game almost exactly, and the acting is phenomenal! I really liked the work they put into this film, and including a lot of background scenes about Mike. Jump-scares are incredibly done, and the animatronics are terrifying! The overall plot of the movie was well maintained, and had me on the edge of my seat for the whole length of the film. Very little CGI was used, really bringing the animatronics to life. For diehard fans of the original game released back in 2014, the movie set, from my observations, was exact! Fantastic film overall, 10 stars!",
    "50": "Do general audiences just not have brains anymore? The audience score for this film is either artificially inflated or people just don't demand absolutely anything from films they watch now.The literal second the blonde cop shows up, I looked at my partner and stated \"oh! The love interest is here!\"Everything about this film is telegraphed a mile away. There is an attempt to build a sense of dread but the film shows its hand almost immediately. The video game this is based on does so much better of a job building a sense of dread.Once you see the the animatronics in full CGI glory it's over. All tension, all scariness. All the air goes out of the room and I'm like \"Ah, cartoons. So Scary!\"It's also obvious immediately that the ghost kids want the little girl. That the thugs the woman hired are going to quickly die. Even the cop being the villain's daughter, the big reveal, was not in any way surprising or shocking.Mr Blum, this film could've been so much better with better writing. I'm available. Lol.",
    "51": "It was...interesting. It started off strong, but then got lost when trying to implement horror elements. The result is an underwhelming and half-baked \"horror\". Despite being lackluster, the film is still worth a watch as it does not fail to entertain. Due to the silly nature of shots, scenes, and acting, you will be sure to forget that it is not a comedy flick. The acting performances were less than stellar, sad to say that includes Matthew Lillard. The film has its charm, and is sure to become a cult classic in the following years. All in all, it is a campy comedy and technically a horror, albeit hindered by its pg13 rating.",
    "52": "This movie lived up to the hype and it was better than expected. Every fan will love it. This was worth waiting 8 years to be honest with you guys. I loved the movie, the comedy and horror were well mixed and that ending was amazing. The whole movie was just great and you all should watch it in theaters as this is the perfect movie for Halloween this season. It will definitely become another horror classic. The Animatronics were perfect just as the cast was. Everyone fit the role perfectly and brought the heart to the movie, the set design was also greatly done. The music fit every scene and was perfectly done\n10/10 will watch it again.",
    "53": "FNaF is a goofy parody of Chuck E. Cheese which took campy horror themes and made a fun and scary game. This movie shifts the tone to a serious family drama, which removed pretty much all fun and comedy from the story. Small jokes are made tongue-in-cheek and we laugh at some common painful experiences we've all had, but overall, it missed the vibe of the game. Another version did a better job of referring to the game and its elements while translating the campy element of the game into campy movie elements. It may have been simpler, but it was closer to the games.. Honestly this movie was more like Doctor Sleep. I'll probably rewatch the Willie's Wonderland movie to get the taste of this one out of my mind.",
    "54": "I can't even start to describe how bored I was watching this. I'm not a fan of video games, so I've had no idea what this movie was going to be about. I didn't even know that was based on a video game, if I knew I would probably just skipped it.I thought it was going to be like that movie with Nicolas Cage something Wonderland, but then it reminded me of another one with the Banana Splits that was supposed to be horror. I don't remember their names, but I'm sure they made more sense than this one.One thing is boring, but this was boring and stupid.Can't care less about a sequel tho it seems that there's going to be one.",
    "55": "Either the original games' atmosphere and story were way worse than I remember them being, or this movie just did a really poor job replicating them. The animatronics themselves just aren't scary and constantly get demystified over the course of this movie, leaving only very few moments where there's actually a hint of horror left. The story, while not entirely uninteresting, still seems convoluted and only holds the movie back even more when it comes to actually being scary or creating a chilling atmosphere. This seems to me like a fine hommage to the original games, which you'll probably find some way to enjoy if you're already a fan of the series. For everyone else though, it's neither that interesting, nor scary. There aren't any interesting stylistic devices present and most moments are either completely forgettable or immediately obvious.Overall I'd give it a watch if you're somewhat interested in the franchise. It's not unwatchable, Just really generic.",
    "56": "Boring, uninteresting schlop that offers incredibly little for those who are already fans of the games and absolutely nothing for those who aren't. I can genuinely not see any reason someone might enjoy this amateurish nothing burger of a movie other than because of a knee jerk positive reaction to seeing matpat or Freddy fazbear or the other animatronics on screen. Just a movie pumped out to grab some extra dollars for the owners and film companies by capitalizing on a name that will be forgotten as soon as it leaves theatres. I'd skip this one, it is not worth your time no matter what you think of the games or the property.",
    "57": "This movie is lame as hell. Super slow and boring. No gore. No nudity. A few weak jump scares that you can see coming from a mile away. The acting is terrible. Two hour long movie felt like five hours. The story is unbelievably cringe. The robots look cool but they don't really do anything other than standing around. If you have a child or a newborn infant then I would recommend taking them to see this lukewarm, fake horror movie but don't expect to be scared or even feel anything at all. The aunt is a hideous hag that barely looks human. The son is a demented little weirdo that never stops whining. The only good actor is the guy who plays the pharmacist. He nailed his lines. Anyone who is scared of this film is most likely faking it just like that idiot did with the game to get views on YouTube. Save your money and buy a hamburger or a hotdog instead. This is an abomination.",
    "58": "This movie has all the feelings of a great idea but with no conviction. As a horror movie it sucks big style and as a comedy it isn't much better. The actors act like they just want a pay check. There are some \"scary scenes\" but they just aren't scary, they are predictable. You will not be jumping out of your seat to this film. I want to say something good about it but there is just so little. The whole movie just has an air of cheap new actors and old has beens. It is also way too long for a movie of this appallingness. 88 to 91 minutes would have sufficed but they made it 110 minutes for no obvious reason. Just an extra 20 minutes for the poor punter to endure. My advice is to just not bother....you will thank me for it in the long run.",
    "59": "I went into this somewhat blindfolded, cause I haven't seen any trailers or a lot of promo material and just was fantastic. I loved the attention to detail in this from the smallest of nods to how the animatronics are actual working ones instead of CGI to how well the cinematography was. Saw this in Xtreme Screen and it was so worth it. Took two of my friends to see it with me and it was the same reaction. I would say if you know the basics of the game you will love this, but if you have no clue about them, maybe give it a skip. Once the credits started to roll, hand were clapping, because of how great this was.",
    "60": "As a fan of fnaf, I didn't mind that the movie kinda broke out of the lore. But it wasn't a great movie. The writing felt lazy, the characters were just fine, there wasn't a whole lot of tension. The whole thing just felt fine, which is weird to me because the cast was great and the animatronic suits were really impressive. The sound design was kinda bad in my opinion, but something that I actually really liked was the lighting. The scenes felt super empty and lifeless, like the places around them weren't real, and even in scenes with extras it felt dull. The movie just fell flat. I'm genuinely happy that so many people enjoyed it, but I feel like you can make a movie that's a love letter to a series and still a good movie on its own.",

For some reason Vanessa is William's daughter instead of Mike, who had his younger brother Garrett (supposedly CC) kidnapped (what?!?) and is taking care of his sister Abby (who?!?). What I mean is fnaf has very (VERY) deep and confusing lore, but the writers had Scott to ask questions, there were a lot of good stories opportunities about what is already known about the stories (like following mike going from restaurant to restaurant, etc).Even if you don't know the franchise, there are a lot of plot holes, like the five children are in the animatronics (freddy, bonnie, chica, foxy, and I guess cupcake?), but where did Garrett go? Why are some children in animatronics and other not. Also, why would William want to employ Mike? He had no reason to kill him, is it just for fun orrr???I enjoyed the movie, the acting is nice and its well filmed, it isn't scary, but it's not bad. It went above my expectations (they were really low), except in that one scene where the animatronics are all laying down in the \"tent\", that was the only real horror in the movie... Anyways, I think Mike is a good character, but Vanessa is useless and only there for exposition and \"HE IS MY FATHER!!!\".I say watch it and make your own opinion about it.",
    "62": "Creating a story in the context of a franchise like FNAF should have been a relatively straightforward task, given the rich lore and established characters. However, it appears that the creators managed to falter in significant ways. While the visual elements of the movie, such as the scenery and costume designs, were commendable to some extent, these superficial aspects should have been just the tip of the iceberg.The fundamental issue lies in the mishandling of the established lore and the names of the characters. FNAF already possesses a complex and intriguing backstory, and it is disappointing to witness how the film failed to honor and expand upon it in a meaningful way. Instead of capitalizing on the well-established universe, the creators appear to have disregarded it, leaving fans and enthusiasts deeply unsatisfied.Vanessa's character, purportedly intended to lead a suspenseful narrative, was one of the movie's glaring disappointments. Her portrayal lacked depth and substance, rendering her unable to effectively carry the weight of the story, ultimately resulting in a dramatic failure.Additionally, the movie's pacing left much to be desired. A well-constructed horror narrative relies on a careful balance between tension and release, but it seems that the film failed to strike this equilibrium. The result was a viewing experience that felt disjointed and lacked the necessary buildup and payoffs expected from a FNAF adaptation.In conclusion, it is regrettable to witness the mismanagement of such a promising concept. While the visual elements demonstrated some effort, the core elements of storytelling and character development fell far short of what the FNAF franchise and its dedicated fanbase deserved. The film's shortcomings raise questions about the decision-making processes involved in its creation and the missed opportunity to create a compelling addition to the FNAF universe.",
    "63": "I was sitting in theaters watching the flabby ford fiz gang and there was a scene where Fraddy Fizzbor Fazzed all over the screen, it really felt like he fazzed all over me and my friends (my schizophrenic medication isn't working). I loved the nude scene with the cupcake too, it felt like the frosting really went in my mouth! And at the end Oppenheimer dropped his nuke on the pizzeraria and I loved seeing the flabby ford fizzington gang get obliterated by the atomic bomb.That is why I put it at 9 stars.But honestly it was a really great movie and I would rewatch it any day. I gotta go my grandma's calling me up from the basement (my Freddy fazbear cave) to go eat hotpockets. See ya!",
    "64": "Five Nights at Freddy's, the highly anticipated adaptation of the popular video game series, has finally made its way to the silver screen. As a big fan of the original games, I approached this release with great enthusiasm, hoping for a bone-chilling, suspenseful experience that would do justice to its gaming origins. However, much to my dismay, this cinematic endeavor left much to be desired. Despite a few redeeming qualities, I regret to say that the final product only deserves a 4/10 rating.The film, directed by a promising newcomer in the industry, had the potential to be a horror masterpiece. The premise, which centers around a security guard surviving nights at a haunted animatronic-filled pizzeria, was ripe for suspense and terror. Sadly, it fell flat in execution, leaving me longing for the scares that never came.One of the biggest disappointments of Five Nights at Freddy's was the lackluster character development. The film introduced a cast of intriguing characters, from the tormented security guard to the mysterious animatronics. However, their potential was squandered, and we were left with underdeveloped, two-dimensional figures who lacked depth and personality. We needed a reason to care about their fates, but it never came.Moreover, the film's pacing was sluggish. While the games are known for their slow-building tension, the movie felt like an interminable waiting game, much like the protagonist's nightly vigil. Instead of suspense, we were subjected to long stretches of monotony, punctuated by occasional, tepid jump-scares that failed to evoke the heart-pounding fear we hoped for.Speaking of jump-scares, this is where the film truly faltered. The jump-scares were lukewarm at best. In a horror movie, these moments should be used to jolt the audience out of their seats, leaving them breathless and terrified. Unfortunately, Five Nights at Freddy's seemed to mistake repetition for effectiveness. The animatronics' predictable and lackluster appearances drained the film of any shock value. It was a missed opportunity to genuinely scare the audience.The film's lack of innovation in its presentation was a significant letdown. While the source material is known for its unique and eerie atmosphere, the movie failed to capture that same sense of dread. The pizzeria, a central element of the story, felt uninspired, and the film lacked the creepy ambiance that made the games so unsettling. The creators could have drawn inspiration from the games to create a more immersive and visually arresting experience, but it felt like a wasted opportunity.Five Nights at Freddy's also suffered from a disjointed and incoherent narrative. The film hopped between different time periods and perspectives, leaving viewers confused and detached from the story. It was as if the filmmakers were trying to cram too much of the game's lore into a single film, resulting in a messy and convoluted plot. It was difficult to invest in the story when it lacked cohesion and clarity.The film's visuals, while decent, failed to stand out in the crowded genre of horror. The animatronics, despite being a central element of the story, looked more comical than terrifying. The use of practical effects was commendable, but their execution left much to be desired. A sense of eeriness and uncanny valley realism was missing, leaving a significant void in the horror department.One aspect of the film that did shine was the soundtrack. The haunting and discordant score created an atmosphere of unease, which was one of the few elements that managed to maintain the tension in certain scenes. The music, composed by a talented artist, was a testament to the film's potential, but it alone couldn't salvage the entire project.In the end, Five Nights at Freddy's was a missed opportunity in the world of horror cinema. With the right direction, character development, pacing, and innovative presentation, it could have been a genre-defining masterpiece. Unfortunately, it fell short of those expectations, delivering a lukewarm experience that left me yearning for the true terror and suspense that the source material promises.In conclusion, the film was a disappointment to fans of the game series and casual moviegoers alike. It lacked the necessary elements to make it a compelling and truly horrifying experience. With a more skillful adaptation, it could have been a standout entry in the horror genre. However, as it stands, Five Nights at Freddy's deserves a 4/10 rating, reflecting its inability to fulfill its potential and deliver the scares that audiences were hoping for.",
    "65": "This movie was hands down one of the worst, most boring films I've ever paid to watch. No plot, no intense scenes, no horror scenes. Everyone in the movie has no common sense and the little girl is literally a moron. The little girl becomes beasties with the animatronics, how stupid. Average acting. He man lives in a good house but is broke. They had some humor but it was short lasting. The plot of the movie too its sweet time developing. The movie is so low and the movie it's even focused on the robots and the original lore. If you are a five nights at Freddy's fan, do not waste you time and money on this movie.",
    "66": "I usually like the cheap and cheerful Blumhouse movies but this one properly sucks. A really terrible story that is totally pointless and feels like it was made up in the fly, terrible dialogue, cheap special effects and worse of all its not at all scary, how this got a 15 certificate I'll never know!! I was happy to see Matthew Lillard get a big screen movie as it seems like ages since I've seen him In anything, after this I think it'll be a while before he's back on our screen, awful performance. This is the worst film I've seen in ages and the first one I actually considered walking out of. This film is soooo bad it should have been shown at thanksgiving. Do yourself a favour and avoid this turkey.",
    "67": "Why does it look so much like another fnaf fanfiction? In these phrases there is nothing recognizable from the original series, except perhaps the animatronics themselves, as if this film is trying hard to seem like canon, but it's not him. And judging by the introduction, I can already say that this film will be a weak thriller of category B for the young target audience of fnaf, BRAVO SCOTT!!It was once a horror, but it became a children's entertainment, because it is more profitable to work for a children's audience...The ending where Steve Raglan (William Afton) dies from spring locks in a springbonnie suit is literally taken from Scott Cawton's 2017 book silver eyes, but unlike the book version, where the suit slams shut because he was pushed away by the main protagonist Charlie, whom he took hostage, then in the film spring locks are triggered from for the fact that an animatronic cupcake jumps on Springbonnie, biting off part of the belly of the suit and touching these springs...... What a cringe......The villain himself, William Afton, did not seem interesting to me from the word at all, an ordinary sadist. For the children's audience for which this film is designed, it may work, but as a character it is empty and simplified.The costumes, especially the Springbonnie costume, look worse than many fan cosplay costumes. I mean, William Afton's suit looks bulky, carelessly made, as if the designers did not even try to make a nice costume design, and the material from which it is made looks like some kind of sponge.The pizzeria itself, especially the office, has absolutely no atmosphere of the first part, and looks cardboard. In fact, everything in this movie looks hastily done. As if the creators abandoned this project for years and after a long time decided to make a film with the most simplified story and collect money from the youngest audience.I'm not waiting for a sequel or prequel, because as a true fan of the series, I don't want to suffer seeing how fnaf buries itself deeper into the grave. Not that I expected some very atmospheric and dark thriller with a very charismatic film adaptation of William Afton, but in my opinion it turned out to be the worst option.",
    "68": "This movie was absolutely incredible. It follows the storyline to the original game almost exactly, and the acting is phenomenal! I really liked the work they put into this film, and including a lot of background scenes about Mike. Jump-scares are incredibly done, and the animatronics are terrifying! The overall plot of the movie was well maintained, and had me on the edge of my seat for the whole length of the film. Very little CGI was used, really bringing the animatronics to life. For diehard fans of the original game released back in 2014, the movie set, from my observations, was exact! Fantastic film overall, 10 stars!",
    "69": "Do general audiences just not have brains anymore? The audience score for this film is either artificially inflated or people just don't demand absolutely anything from films they watch now.The literal second the blonde cop shows up, I looked at my partner and stated \"oh! The love interest is here!\"Everything about this film is telegraphed a mile away. There is an attempt to build a sense of dread but the film shows its hand almost immediately. The video game this is based on does so much better of a job building a sense of dread.Once you see the the animatronics in full CGI glory it's over. All tension, all scariness. All the air goes out of the room and I'm like \"Ah, cartoons. So Scary!\"It's also obvious immediately that the ghost kids want the little girl. That the thugs the woman hired are going to quickly die. Even the cop being the villain's daughter, the big reveal, was not in any way surprising or shocking.Mr Blum, this film could've been so much better with better writing. I'm available. Lol.",
    "70": "It was...interesting. It started off strong, but then got lost when trying to implement horror elements. The result is an underwhelming and half-baked \"horror\". Despite being lackluster, the film is still worth a watch as it does not fail to entertain. Due to the silly nature of shots, scenes, and acting, you will be sure to forget that it is not a comedy flick. The acting performances were less than stellar, sad to say that includes Matthew Lillard. The film has its charm, and is sure to become a cult classic in the following years. All in all, it is a campy comedy and technically a horror, albeit hindered by its pg13 rating.",
    "71": "This movie lived up to the hype and it was better than expected. Every fan will love it. This was worth waiting 8 years to be honest with you guys. I loved the movie, the comedy and horror were well mixed and that ending was amazing. The whole movie was just great and you all should watch it in theaters as this is the perfect movie for Halloween this season. It will definitely become another horror classic. The Animatronics were perfect just as the cast was. Everyone fit the role perfectly and brought the heart to the movie, the set design was also greatly done. The music fit every scene and was perfectly done\n10/10 will watch it again.",
    "72": "FNaF is a goofy parody of Chuck E. Cheese which took campy horror themes and made a fun and scary game. This movie shifts the tone to a serious family drama, which removed pretty much all fun and comedy from the story. Small jokes are made tongue-in-cheek and we laugh at some common painful experiences we've all had, but overall, it missed the vibe of the game. Another version did a better job of referring to the game and its elements while translating the campy element of the game into campy movie elements. It may have been simpler, but it was closer to the games.. Honestly this movie was more like Doctor Sleep. I'll probably rewatch the Willie's Wonderland movie to get the taste of this one out of my mind.",
    "73": "I can't even start to describe how bored I was watching this. I'm not a fan of video games, so I've had no idea what this movie was going to be about. I didn't even know that was based on a video game, if I knew I would probably just skipped it.I thought it was going to be like that movie with Nicolas Cage something Wonderland, but then it reminded me of another one with the Banana Splits that was supposed to be horror. I don't remember their names, but I'm sure they made more sense than this one.One thing is boring, but this was boring and stupid.Can't care less about a sequel tho it seems that there's going to be one.",
    "74": "Either the original games' atmosphere and story were way worse than I remember them being, or this movie just did a really poor job replicating them. The animatronics themselves just aren't scary and constantly get demystified over the course of this movie, leaving only very few moments where there's actually a hint of horror left. The story, while not entirely uninteresting, still seems convoluted and only holds the movie back even more when it comes to actually being scary or creating a chilling atmosphere. This seems to me like a fine hommage to the original games, which you'll probably find some way to enjoy if you're already a fan of the series. For everyone else though, it's neither that interesting, nor scary. There aren't any interesting stylistic devices present and most moments are either completely forgettable or immediately obvious.Overall I'd give it a watch if you're somewhat interested in the franchise. It's not unwatchable, Just really generic.",
    "75": "Boring, uninteresting schlop that offers incredibly little for those who are already fans of the games and absolutely nothing for those who aren't. I can genuinely not see any reason someone might enjoy this amateurish nothing burger of a movie other than because of a knee jerk positive reaction to seeing matpat or Freddy fazbear or the other animatronics on screen. Just a movie pumped out to grab some extra dollars for the owners and film companies by capitalizing on a name that will be forgotten as soon as it leaves theatres. I'd skip this one, it is not worth your time no matter what you think of the games or the property.",
    "76": "This movie is lame as hell. Super slow and boring. No gore. No nudity. A few weak jump scares that you can see coming from a mile away. The acting is terrible. Two hour long movie felt like five hours. The story is unbelievably cringe. The robots look cool but they don't really do anything other than standing around. If you have a child or a newborn infant then I would recommend taking them to see this lukewarm, fake horror movie but don't expect to be scared or even feel anything at all. The aunt is a hideous hag that barely looks human. The son is a demented little weirdo that never stops whining. The only good actor is the guy who plays the pharmacist. He nailed his lines. Anyone who is scared of this film is most likely faking it just like that idiot did with the game to get views on YouTube. Save your money and buy a hamburger or a hotdog instead. This is an abomination.",
    "77": "This movie has all the feelings of a great idea but with no conviction. As a horror movie it sucks big style and as a comedy it isn't much better. The actors act like they just want a pay check. There are some \"scary scenes\" but they just aren't scary, they are predictable. You will not be jumping out of your seat to this film. I want to say something good about it but there is just so little. The whole movie just has an air of cheap new actors and old has beens. It is also way too long for a movie of this appallingness. 88 to 91 minutes would have sufficed but they made it 110 minutes for no obvious reason. Just an extra 20 minutes for the poor punter to endure. My advice is to just not bother....you will thank me for it in the long run.",
    "78": "I went into this somewhat blindfolded, cause I haven't seen any trailers or a lot of promo material and just was fantastic. I loved the attention to detail in this from the smallest of nods to how the animatronics are actual working ones instead of CGI to how well the cinematography was. Saw this in Xtreme Screen and it was so worth it. Took two of my friends to see it with me and it was the same reaction. I would say if you know the basics of the game you will love this, but if you have no clue about them, maybe give it a skip. Once the credits started to roll, hand were clapping, because of how great this was.",
    "79": "As a fan of fnaf, I didn't mind that the movie kinda broke out of the lore. But it wasn't a great movie. The writing felt lazy, the characters were just fine, there wasn't a whole lot of tension. The whole thing just felt fine, which is weird to me because the cast was great and the animatronic suits were really impressive. The sound design was kinda bad in my opinion, but something that I actually really liked was the lighting. The scenes felt super empty and lifeless, like the places around them weren't real, and even in scenes with extras it felt dull. The movie just fell flat. I'm genuinely happy that so many people enjoyed it, but I feel like you can make a movie that's a love letter to a series and still a good movie on its own.",
    "80": "Just fresh out of the cinema after seeing Five Nights at Freddy's, so here's my spoiler free review for it.Now, personally, I don't find the actual concept of FNAF all that scary so I personally wasn't \"scared\" watching this. The jumpscares were effective but did this movie ever really make me feel uneasy? No, not really. But again, that's personal preference and not a dig at the movie at all.The sound design, cinematography and the overall design of everything (from the animatronics to the actual restaurant) is incredible.Now, here in the UK the film is rated 15 (which means children cannot watch it. Even if they are accompanied by an adult). In the USA, I know it's PG-13. For Americans who are probably wondering \"Can I take my kid to see this?\". Well, that's down to you. The film isn't overloaded with gory imagery, but there are one or two moments where it is extremely brutal, so just keep that in mind.The \"twist\" at the end, and yes there's a twist, is... predictable, in all honesty. If you don't know anything about the lore, then yeah it might catch you off guard. But if you're even just slightly knowledgable about it, you probably wouldn't call it a twist.Out of the horror movies I have seen, I'd honestly say this is one of the more lighthearted ones. There's a lot of humour here, as well as moments that do kinda make you think \"Is this a horror film?\". It's not \"balls-to-the-wall\" scary and I honestly don't think it was trying to be, nor does it need to be. It's just a fun film with horror elements, to me.Overall, really enjoyed it and would recommend it if you're wanting something to watch for spooky season that is not too intense. It'd also be a great entry for anyone just getting into horror movies.",
    "81": "If you loved the FNAF games, go see this, at the base level it's fun to see this stuff come to life, especially when the costume design and set design are this good.If you're a harsh critic, you might HATE this film.Its biggest problems are character development overall storyline, and horror factor. (This would be better if R-Rated, however, that's not to say you can't make a great PG13 horror flick.)Acting wasn't too bad, Hutchinson and Lillard are as good as they can be with the writing they were given. Same with the kids in the movie.How to Make it Better?: I can see this being a MUCH better film if they were to treat it like a one-room horror adventure, much like the game. Keep Mike in the chair, terrified of leaving the office, trying to keep the monsters back. (Something like Devil, or Panic Room) - Throughout the film they could've given him flashbacks to connect dots, conversations over the phone, and during the day he makes rounds in the town to figure things out - Then they could make his reason for going back each night valuable, like he wants to solve the mystery of the animatronics, etc.Just fell flat, beautiful to look at, some fun scenes, but you won't recommend the film to anyone who hasn't played FNAF.",
    "82": "So, I know it must be extremely difficult to take a simple gaming concept like Five Nights at Freddy's and stretch that idea out into a full blown movie. I totally understand that artistic hardship, but...The script missed the mark folks.I honestly enjoyed the stunning look of everything, which I gather most people assume would be top notch given the studio that made the film, but wow... the basic story was so very weak. I'm pretty forgiving when it comes to horror movies, but this was moving into borderline \"cheese\", parody territory.The positives: I was living for the look of the creature costumes. So many kudos there. The acting is pretty decent for a studio movie, as it really should be. Matthew Lillard was the standout performance in my opinion. The music was pretty cool too.Everything considered, I honestly enjoyed myself, which is the point of any entertainment product after all. So I give it a six. But that side-story, and most of the dialogue really needed to bake in the oven a little longer before being served up.",
    "83": "A security guard gets a job, and suddenly realises he's going to have an incredibly challenging and difficult night.I genuinely and desperately wanted to love this film, the trailers looked so cool, and despite not being a gamer, I knew of the game.Now, if I were judging this solely on the visuals, I'd be giving it a mammoth score, and healing praise onto it, it does look fantastic, and as for the 'locals,' they look so cool, the special effects are great, genuinely a smashing looking film, one that my fifteen year old self would have loved.Now, the important bit, the translation from game to film, I really wish I could say it worked brilliantly, I'm not sure, I think there's something missing, does the story work? Sadly I'd have to argue that I don't think it does.I think younger teens will genuinely enjoy this movie, for horror lovers like myself, it may be lacking a bit of bite, similar to M3GAN, very watchable, just a little tame.6/10.",
    "84": "I found the concept to be a bit cartoonish, so I was expecting it to be more fun. The story had a slow start, and the main character's easily startled, and his constant jumpiness gets old pretty quick. Surprisingly, there weren't many jump scares, and it felt like a slasher movie without the slashing. They shied away from showing the gruesome stuff, opting for screams, shadows, and implied horrors. It's a little bit slow paced, thought it was a slow burn buildup but it doesn't get to the highs. It feels like it drags slightly.While the premise was interesting, it seemed like they focused solely on the plot, neglecting the fun and scariness. The concept was fresh, but it lacked imagination in the end. The whole \"kidnapped little brother\" storyline felt like an excuse for allowing his sister to interact with the robots, even though it was illogical given how much he cared for her. Hard to believe he wanted to find his brother so much he's willing to 'sacrifice' his sister. This inconsistency was hard to overlook.The film wasn't particularly thrilling, but I I did like how the aunt got got, even though it wasn't shown explicitly. The introduction of the yellow rabbit was genuinely scary, how he walked out, but once he started talking he wasn't so frightening anymore..Anyway, it's a little generic, not as fun nor creepy as it could've been; not too much to get you interested in the characters even though they did have some depth. Ultimately, a pretty mediocre and forgettable film.",
    "85": "Just saw Five Nights at Freddy's. That.... was a hot mess. Let's talk about positives first. The Jim Henson Shop out did themselves bringing Freddy and friends to life. They did primarily practical effects and it shows, the animatronics being the best part of the film. Another positive is the music, which was outstanding!Unfortunately, that's where my positives stop. This film has two major problems. First, it's PG13. This movie would have benefitted greatly from an R rating, it was tamer than the games. Second, the film can't decide if it is for fans or newcomers. The actual FNAF storyline is largely secondary to the plot of the lead character trying to discover who kidnapped his brother as a child. It's annoying, because when it's not being FNAF, it's just boring. (Also maybe it's the direction given, but the leads were pretty bland). They try to do a mystery thing with the FNAF storyline that doesn't work if you know the games. Matthew Lillard was perfectly cast, but woefully underused (He's in maybe 15min of the movie). Overall, I have to give FNAF the movie a C-. If you want a good version of Five Nights in film, stick with Willy's Wonderland, it's much better.",
    "86": "I will try to keep this short and concise but overall I think the movie holds up to most expectations. Many of the negative reviews here are concerned with the plot but completely ignore the other amazing aspects of this movie, so I will talk about each of them one by one.I don't think the plot is that convoluted but that just might be because I've been a fan of FNAF for 9 years and I'm used to unnecessarily confusing plots. After watching the movie I could look back and say, yeah I understood that, so in my opinion it's not too bad.Lore-wise I don't think this movie is meant to be groundbreaking or anything, and that's not what I was expecting. If you come into this movie looking for game lore I don't think you would enjoy it as much as you would if you were just in it for the experience.The acting in this movie is incredible and I also really like the costumes and they really sell the show.The atmosphere lives up the expectations being based off of the first game, it feels really authentic and I quite enjoyed finding Easter eggs and such in the background.The music and scares were all pretty well done and I enjoyed them :)At the end of the day this movie is meant to be for the fans and I think that may be the reason why it's so negatively reviewed by the critics. I think as a movie meant for the fans it does what it needed to do and finally gave us the movie adaptation of this game we've been waiting for.",
    "87": "Fans of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game series were eagerly awaiting the release of the film adaptation, but unfortunately, the results were less than stellar. The film's biggest problem is its focus on the relationship between the security guard and his long lost brother. This subplot takes up a significant amount of screen time, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and unsatisfying. The audience is never given a good enough reason to care about Garrett, and his relationship with his brother feels rushed and forced.As a result of this focus on the human drama, the film doesn't have enough time to develop the animatronics, which are the real stars of the show in the video games. Freddy, Chica, Bonnie, and Foxy are all iconic characters with a lot of potential, but they're relegated to supporting roles in the film. They're barely given any personality or backstory, and their motivations are never fully explained beyond the obvious spoiler (which I won't disclose).The film's pacing is also a major issue. The first half of the film is incredibly slow and boring, with little to no action or suspense. The second half picks up the pace a bit, but it's still too late to save the film. The scares are few and far between, and the ones that are there are mostly predictable and uninspired. Definitely a PG-13 film.Overall, the Five Nights at Freddy's film is a disappointing adaptation of the beloved video game series. It's a shame that the filmmakers didn't focus more on the animatronics and the horror elements, as those are the things that fans were most looking forward to seeing.I'll give it 4/10 as the set was good. The lead actor was also very good in his role, but had little to work with.",
    "88": "There have now been three films in this oeuvre, all of which are remarkably similar: The Banana Splits Movie; Willy's Wonderland; and Five Nights At Freddy's.The latter two of which have incredibly similar plots.Of course, I know this particular film is supposed to be based off a popular video game (of the same name)...and not just a blatant ripoff of the previous films.Although, I've never played it myself...so don't know how true to it it is.One thing is for sure, however...this is by far the worst of the three.Mainly, because the storyline, here, is so poorly developed.Meaning that The Banana Splits Movie still reigns supreme, at the top of the list.Although, this does seem to pay- at least a little bit of- homage to both of the previous films.In regards to the former, how the little girl makes friends with the robots.And in regards to the latter, with the scene where they have the main character cleaning up the mess left by the goons (in true Nicholas Cage fashion).The main issue I have with this film, is that there is too much focus on the backstory- where I found myself wanting it to be more of a pure horror.With the whole angle about the robots \"being haunted by the ghosts of dead children\" seemingly thrown in out of nowhere...which just didn't jive for me.On top of that, the little girl is portrayed to be much too childish for her age.So much so, that it's almost cartoonish.While, the overall structure of the storyline just doesn't seem to gel.Every time I thought the horror was about to kick in...it just ended up being drawn out even further, to make room for additional aspects of the backstory.Which seemed to be largely unnecessary.As, it, plain and simply, could have- and would have- been better, if they focused on making it less of a drama, and more of a horror.Because, in reality...there is almost no horror in this at all!And when it does, eventually, kick in...it's incredibly anti-climactic.Which leaves you feeling like, \"I sat through all that...for this?!\".At the very least...it comes off as a massive missed oppourtunity.Because I really thought this was going to be cool.But, frankly...it's quite lame.So I can't help but be disappointed by the whole thing.Because this was a completely unrewarding experience.2 out of 10.",
    "89": "Five Nights at Freddy's is a new horror film arrangement and written in part by Emma Tammi, director of The Wind. The films are based on the horror game of the same name.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) works as a night security guard at the local pizzeria Freddy Fazbear. He has to work here for five nights, but during these nights he discovers that something is wrong with the pizzeria's animatronic costumes. So he begins to learn about a dark secret.This game adaptation works better for people who are familiar with the horror game, because it contains nice references and other easter eggs that link back to the game. People who don't know the game will not really understand these things.For a game known for its jump scares, designed to frighten and further frighten players, the film strangely has almost none of these horror moments. This film sometimes seems more meaningful to younger viewers of just sixteen. For older viewers, the film is not scary and if they know nothing about the game, the film may be more unclear, or overcome separately.The location of the famous pizzeria from the game seems positive, especially for people who are familiar with it. Since most movie studios didn't use CGI for this movie, the animatronic costumes of the Fazbear crew have to be brought into the movie. Jim Henson's Orphan Shop was responsible for the Fazbear crew. They are performed by puppeteers and stunt artists. This will get her across.However, the story of the film can be a problem for viewers of the film. In addition to the story around the pizzeria, it also tells the story of the main character. In addition to a dark past, he also has a struggle to retain the rights to raise his youngest sister. These storylines do not always correspond well with each other, which means that the film can sometimes be a bit unclear and difficult to overcome.This inferior script sometimes makes it difficult for the actors to come across well. Josh Hutcherson sometimes remains a bit vague. He does come across well as an older brother who tries to take good care of his sister. His sister is played by Piper Rubio, who delivers some decent acting for a novice actress. The brother and sister actors have a well-known bond together. Matthew Lillard also plays a small role in the film, which he portrays appropriately. After his previous acting work in Scream and Scooby-Doo, it is also nice to see him again in this horror film.",
    "90": "Five Nights at Freddy's is an adaptation of a popular video game. It already served as an inspiration for the much better The Banana Splits Movie in 2019.What should be a gory comedy horror movie. Five Nights at Freddy's is a more serious movie about grief and loss masquerading as a horror film.Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) is a security guard with many issues. He cannot get over the fact that his brother was abducted when he was a kid and was never found. Mike is unable to hold a steady job, hooked on pills and has anger issues.Mike cares for his withdrawn younger sister Abby and faces a custody battle over her with his aunt Jane.His career advisor Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard) gets him a job as a night guard at an abandoned family diner known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Mike reluctantly accepts as he needs the job to keep custody of his sister.Only when he dozes off at work, it sort of amplifies the events leading up to his brother's abduction in his dreams. He also meets Vanessa Shelly, a cop who seems to know more about the history of the park.Then there are the creepy animatronic mascots. They come alive and kill some delinquents sent by aunt Jane to damage the diner, so Mike would get fired. The mascots later take an interest with Abby as they seem to bond with her when Mike brought her to work one day.This is such an uneven film, I though it was two different kind of movies that got meshed together. The horror parts only comes alive much later. Even then it is tame in order to be a family friendly scary movie.The similar themed Willy's Wonderland was more fun with a silent Nicolas Cage causing mayhem.",
    "91": "Another week, another Blumhouse horror film.Based on a video game series (which I have no played), Five Nights at Freddy's is another 80s nostlgia horror flick. The plot revolves around a closed chucky cheese like restaurant from the 80s where the animatronics come to life and murder people.It's a great premise, and the film certainly sets up some interesting ideas, and wisely gives the main characer some agency. He's a down on his luck guy who after losing his family cares for his kid sister, but suffers the same mysterious dream every night. Personally, I would have found it more plausible and interesting if the dreams had begun when he started working at Freddy's which would make more sense in light of the nature of the dream and his interactions therein.Unfortunately, once the female cop shows up, the film begins to come apart. She does not act like a cop at all, being entirely understanding and way too friendly, going for a walk and sitting down with him at the river at their second meeting. Yes, this is (poorly) expained later on, but the writing of their scenes is awful.The best scenes in the film belong to the lawyer of the protagonist's aunt. He's hilarious. They set her up as a great antagonist, only to drop that entire plotline.The animatronics are well designed and sufficiently creepy, but the film shies away from violence and never really commits to being a horror film. It seems to be more geared towards kids, especially with the \"fun\" scenes of partying and playing with the robots, but I'm not sure it really works. Much of the acting is pretty bad (especially the cop), with the protagonist never cracking a joke and wearing the exact same facial expression the entire movie. The second half suffers some real pacing issues, but the worst part is the ham fisted exposition dump that explains the robots. The moment the mystery is solved, you can feel the film deflating as the suspense is all but gone. You instantly know how it's going to end.Matthew Lillard of Scream fame is there again and does what you expect him to do. It drags on too long, and outstays its welcome, especially once we realize the horror we were promised isn't happening.A pity. WIth tighter editing and a bit more energy to the main characer, this could have been great.",
    "92": "I was looking forward to this movie, because I was hoping they would have the good sense to make it a proper horror movie. Instead what we have is anything but. Let me explain, this movie was NOT a horror movie. This was a \"who done it?\" with a horror theme. Now, why does this matter? Because now you're piecing together what happened, while being in a movie that largely tries(and fails) to establish itself as a horror. The twists and turns are more like tiny corners that anyone can see around, and were largely predictable. But the worst thing BY FAR was the fact that someone at the studio actually had the gall to make this movie rated PG-13 instead of R thereby having to cut out ALL the gore. So what you get is a movie that has no horror scenes in it. And it would've been a great movie had they left the gore in and really leaned into it, but instead it's bad, really really bad.3/10 I give actors credit for being the only good part of this movie. The studio is responsible for this catastrophe, not the writers, not the actors, just the studio execs.",
    "93": "Wow. This movie was a rollercoaster. If you haven't played the games, I can understand why you may dislike or be confused about what was going on in the film. BUT! If your a long-time fan of the games (myself included) you'll love it. The cast is amazing. Josh Hutcherson as mike was a great casting choice and in my opinion, he basically is mike in real life.There's plenty of easter eggs for fans and got me looking everywhere for secrets!! While the movie isn't exactly like the games, it's faithful enough that you can recognise it as a fnaf film and not some generic horror.Long story short, if your not a fan of fnaf, this movie probably isn't going to be good to you. It can be confusing and odd and that's honestly understandable. Though to people willing to get into it or just fans in general, I can guaranteed that this film will meet your expectations and standards.",
    "94": "This movie adaptation of popular video game Five Nights at Freddy's has been a long time coming; in the meantime, we've had The Banana Splits Movie and Willy's Wonderland, both of which have illustrated that making a decent film about killer animatronics is no walk in the park.Similar to Willy's Wonderland, FNAF sees a newly recruited security guard (Josh Hutcherson) discovering that the mechanical attractions at a closed-down themed restaurant have a life of their own. And just like Willy's Wonderland, the film squanders any potential for a wild and gory white-knuckle ride, director Emma Tammi delivering a very tame experience that focuses more on security guard Mike's troubled past and his relationship with his young sister Abby (Piper Rubio) than it does on the horror of being stalked and killed by homicidal machines.Avid gamers might enjoy seeing the characters come to life on the big screen, but I imagine even the most forgiving of Freddy fans will be disappointed by the lack of atmosphere, thrills and OTT violence in this uninspired Blumhouse misfire.",
    "95": "I know nothing of the game so reviewing it as the 'horror' film it claims to be.It's no horror film. I've seen scarier adverts.While the film has great visuals, these visuals are limited to the animatronics and half a derelict pizza place.What acting there is, is good. Likewise the soundtrack.But where it all falls apart is the paper thin plot, that is told rather than shown.First third of the movie is merely an exemplar to explain the game. The rest an extremely linear story that fails to explain itself.At no point is there any horror. Not even an atmospheric build-up.While the animatronics are good that in itself does not make a good film.I'm told the idea comes from a very popular game. No doubt these fanbois will think me a heretic who 'does not get it'. But I'm a movie-goer, not a gamer and this very poor film was at the movies.Keep in mind I'm reviewing the film, not the game.",
    "96": "This film had been getting excitement buzz for a large portion of the year and I could never work out why. It looked like it was going to be terrible. I'm guessing fans of the game were creating the excitement. I went in with an open mind though hoping to be pleasantly surprised. I was not sadly. This was the worst film I have seen in 2023.First of all, the film is incredibly boring. There is almost no horror in it. There's one scene near the midway point that would be considered horror I suppose, but it was probably the most boring scene in the entire movie. I understand the film is PG-13 but come on, give us something to work with.Then you have the unbearable characters. As if the adults weren't bad enough, the film adds an unlikable child to the centre of the story. Who thought that was going to be a good idea?Then there's the animatronic \"villains\" of the movie. I have never seen less scary creatures in a movie before. You could put these in a Disney Pixar movie and toddlers wouldn't be afraid of them.The film is long for a horror movie, coming in at around 110 minutes, and it feels every bit of it. The pacing is non-existent. Long scene after long scene with nothing being added to the story. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked my watch.People who choose this film as their 2023 Halloween film are going to be annoyed and let down. It's safe, bland and could barely be called horror. A generous 3/10.",
    "97": "One of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I usually rate way better than movies deserve. I scare very easily and absolutely none of this was the slightest bit frightening.Weak scoring, mediocre acting, SOO many plot holes, and low-tension conflict.This has less tension than a rom-com to be completely honest. I would not be surprised to learn that the script was written by a bot. Every plot point was predictable and each piece of dialogue felt like it was copy and pasted from every other movie I've seen.This was pretty much just a well-funded fan fiction. I expected much more of an adaptation of a very fun and frightening video game.It might be fun for kids, but it's not exactly appropriate because there is violence, so I'm not sure what audience they were going for... it certainly wasn't me.",
    "98": "My wife and I recently watched Five Nights at Freddy's (2023) on Peacock this evening. The storyline centers around an older brother striving to provide for his younger sister, whom his aunt intends to adopt. He accepts a job at an abandoned establishment reminiscent of Chuck E. Cheese, only to discover that the animatronics within are far more alive than they initially seem.Directed by Emma Tammi (The Wind), the film features a cast that includes Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games), Matthew Lillard (Scream), Elizabeth Dean Lail (You), Piper Rubio (Unstable), and Mary Stuart Masterson (The Stepford Wives).This movie possesses a wealth of potential with a captivating concept, provocative settings, a strong cast, and intriguing subplots. It had all the elements necessary for a potential masterpiece but falls short of expectations. The kill scenes are disappointingly lackluster, starting from the opening credits, which could have set a thrilling tone but did not deliver. There's a distinct absence of gore, visual depictions of killings, blood splatter, or any such elements. The film's PG-13 rating is a clear limitation. It's a missed opportunity, as the atmosphere is well-crafted, and the cast delivers stellar 10/10 performances. Lillard is a perfect fit for his role, and Masterson makes for an excellent villain. Hutcherson's performance is compelling, portraying an authentic big brother dealing with inner turmoil. The ending reveal adds to the film's intrigue. However, the subpar kill scenes remain a glaring flaw.In conclusion, Five Nights at Freddy's had the potential for greatness had it pushed the envelope and embraced an R-rating for a more intense horror experience. Instead, it caters to a middle school audience. I would give it a 4/10 rating, but I still recommend watching it at least once.",
    "99": "This movie is absolutely boring to the core it makes nicholas cage movie willy's wonderland look like a complete master piece (which it isn't) this movie consists of bad acting, flash back dreams, and some fluffy robots..\nBut for first hour or so not much actually really happens, you will struggle to actually want to watch the entire movie after being so bored already.Why is it a 15 (uk) no one really knows, a little blood here little blood there is about it.This title and any other they make will go down to the pit with all the other badly done video games to movies.It seems lately anything blumhouse touch turns to sludge rather than gold..Fans of the game will think this is a great movie for the fact is they like the animatronic figures alone but are forgetting about what makes a good movie.",
    "100": "First and foremost, the movie could have been far better easily. It is not an extremely bad movie, but definitely it's not a horror one. I mean, if there is no blood, there is no crime right? So, here nobody dies, Lol.Second, the script is bland and the PG-13 does not help. Obviously with a -R or +18 advice, it could have been a masterpiece. Instead the movie is more oriented to scare Tik Tok generations.Last, the cast is just Ok. I didn't know anyone before the film and after it I'm going to forget all of them. A shame.So, overall a missed opportunity to create something great, fantastic and scary. Definitely , I can't recommend to horror fans, because if there's no blood, there's no crime. Happy Halloween.",
    "101": "The entirety of my nearly sold-out crowd seemed to love this movie. There were five different moments of full applause and cheers from the crowd. You might agree if one or more of the following are true: (1) You've played the video game. (2) You enjoy very tame/light horror. (3) You've enjoyed this new trend of \"family horror\" like M3gan (4 stars).None of those are true for me. I am confident that horror fiends will find it severely underwhelming. This is the kind of movie you might show to a 10-year-old who wants to get into horror movies. Just like with M3gan, the crowd was very young and there were even children.It's severely limited by the cowardly PG-13 rating. But I've liked some PG-13 horror movies, like Insidious. This one just isn't even a tiny bit scary. It didn't make me jump. The \"scary\" scenes amount to about 8% of this movie. The rest is fairly slow and boring.To make it worse, this movie makes no sense. You have to completely turn your brain off and not question anything. Otherwise the complete lack of logic and aimlessness of the story becomes apparent.It also has some very questionable moments and little things that made it feel off. One small example, someone uses fingers so wipe the blood off a knife, a move commonly seen by Ghostface in the Scream movies. The problem is, there's zero blood on the knife.This reminds me of a recent streaming movie with a very similar premise called Willy's Wonderland starring the great Nick Cage. That one didn't hold back, but it was a much lower quality streaming movie than this theatrically released one. I ended up giving it the same score.I didn't hate this movie. It's pretty funny and whimsical. I just really wish it was better and went all out. And I couldn't help but feel befuddled as the rest of my crowd kept going crazy at certain parts. I was sadly jealous.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/26/2023)",
    "102": "I'm gonna be honest, video game movies have been getting better in recent years. And I thought they were gonna get progressively better than they were in early ears in video game adapted movies. But I guess not all of them can be good. Five Nights at Freddy's is just another soulless video game adaptation that only wants to make this movie cash out the games. While it may have some good visuals that stay true to the games with the animatronics and the details on the pizzeria, the movie would provide a plot that relies on just Mike and his arc about his family issues ti the point of becoming predictable. I'll give the movie for trying, but the story around the pizzeria doesn't happen until the third act. Also, the movie is not as scary as you may think. In fact, the movie barely has any scary moments. Most we would get is just characters playing around the pizzeria and the animatronics interacting the one character, but not in a thrilling way. And not to mention with how the characters have been handled. Mike being the punching bag and Abby's interactions to the animatronics. And they're connection don't really affect much. I think the best recommendation is this will be for the die hard FNAF fans. After all, they have been asking for many years if there would be an actual FNAF movie, and here we are. You'll probably enjoy it. Outside of that, I don't think it would be worth a watch. It would be better to play the games instead. Actually, I even recommend the fan SFM videos on YouTube. At least some of them can have enjoyable storytelling. As for the actual movie, the only thing we would get is just disappointing and easily dull. I guess I'll just wait for Sonic The Hedgehog 3 next year. Happy Halloween.",
    "103": "OK, I admit it, I've never played the game but have got a 10 year old nephew who is incredibly excited to see this film because he loves the characters. I have to surmise that the games involve sneaking around the diner while avoiding the menacing glare of the animatronics?To be fair most studios who try to adapt what makes computer games so successful onto the screen fail. I'm thinking of you Street Fighter 2, The Last of Us, Super Mario Brothers, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat, *The Witcher, Resident Evil - the problem is that playing a game is incredibly immersive, as should be watching a film, and video games have much, much more license to take their time in getting you to bond with the character and story you're telling.I digress, massively. Basically, FNaF's is slow, boring, predictable. You do not spend any time with the monsters (hardly) and I get the feeling the storytellers couldn't decide if we, the audience, were supposed to sympathise with them, or fear them.",
    "104": "I know zero about the source material, so I can't say whether this is true or not.This film doesn't seem to know which audience it belongs to. It's too scary for children, too tame for people over twelve. (Here in Australia, it is rated for people over 15.) It also seems like two separate stories which don't quite mesh at the end but leave it open to possible sequels, which is what most films do these days to rake in the dollars for franchises. The story isn't fully fleshed out, leading to an unsatisfying ending.Josh Hutcherson does his best here, but is let down by a poor supporting cast with the exception of the actress who plays his sister Abby, and Matthew Lillard, who is great in everything he does.I suppose this film is good for a slumber party of tweens defying their parents. If you're outside this age group, you probably won't enjoy it.",
    "105": "I remember watching a FNAF rip-off movie with Nicolas Cage called Willy's Wonderland, and that movie was terrible but somehow the animatronics on that movie have 10 times more things to do than the FNAF animatronics itself in their own movie, i hate everything in this movie, the only time i feel like the movie has potential was only in the first 5 minutes of the film and that's including the opening credit, FNAF the movie could be at least decent if it's literally like the game, a 90 minutes fun ride in a abandoned kids place, instead we get this boring ass uninteresting backstory of our main character and it's really not working for me at all, and the worst thing is they spend way more time on the main character story than the scary FNAF related stuff, i also wasn't scared for once, the jumpscare are the most predictable and the cheapest jumpscare i've ever experienced, it have some of if not the worst movie editing i've ever watch, the way they cut one scene to another was just terrible and mostly annoying, they also really going hard with the PG-13 rating in this movie so everything related to violence looks absolutely stupid, the performance was meh, sometimes it's cringe, and overall a super boring horror movie, Five Nights At Freddy's was stupid, it is bored to hell, nothing scary, nothing impressive except maybe all the animatronics accurate design, but in terms of story it is one of the worst story to ever adapted from a game, they literally have the easiest concept yet also accurate to the original game instead they wanted to have more story, more drama which will work if the story was interesting, well in this case it was an awfully, dull, and boring story that they expand and it's fail, it's super disappointing even from a guy that was not a FNAF super fan, Five Nights At Freddy's was simply the worst movie of the year so far, and also one of the worst movie i've ever seen.",
    "106": "When I was leaving the cinema I saw a film promotion of paw patrol and wasn't sure if I just witnessed the right movie which was supposed to be Friday night at Freddie's. The security guard spent the first 3 nights sleeping on the job. By the 4th night, he was told that there was ghosts within 5 seconds, he was okay with it and they were all laughing and dancing. Chuck in the mix of the taxi driver comedy scenes and the big giant robot getting in a cab and it was like what?! I can kind of get younger fans feeling some nostalgia but it was just dull for an apparent scary movie. The story was all over the place, some of which made no sense. Some reviews suggest tension or edge of your seat stuff, my advice to them people, never watch the ring or the grudge, you'll never sleep with the lights off again. However I will be fair some of the actors tried, not all but some. I genuinely think this movie could have been a lot better but based on some of the positive reviews, it was solely created for the true fans. If you really want to watch or have been conned by the trailer, I would advise to maybe rent on a stream platform when available.",
    "107": "My videogame experience is so minimal and consistently out of date that the colloquial term \"casual\" is probably too intensive to describe me. With that in mind, and with much more significant interest in cinema, I approached this strictly with concern for how it would come off as a full-length feature, and as a horror feature, with its gaming roots no more than a tertiary curiosity for me. Illustrating the point, I was less interested about any faithfulness as an adaptation than I was about comparing this 2023 flick to 2019's 'The Banana Splits movie,' and 2021's 'Willy's Wonderland,' both of which work with a very similar concept, and about seeing where this fit into the oeuvre of filmmaker Emma Tammi, as by happenstance I've seen all her previous work in the genre. And still all such matters are beside the point: how is 'Five night's at Freddy's?' I had my doubts, but in every regard this is a lot of fun, and it ably delivers the genre flavors we crave; for my part I'm happy to say that I think this is actually really great!I'll say this, it's definitely not what I expected; for the different directions that this took I admit I was a little taken aback. I think the end result does struggle a bit: with tone, with cohesiveness, with pacing, and possibly with feeling a tad common for the path it does walk, while not taking full advantage of the principal imagery (and game mechanics) for which the game franchise is best known (even for an outsider like me). We do certainly get tastes of the animatronics stalking the halls of the restaurant and playhouse, and with smart use of (among other things) lighting, cinematography, editing, and stunts and effects, these scenes are meaningfully creepy and sinister. Yet this is actually the least of what FNAF pursues in its narrative, and while I'm told that the plot does draw on what I gather is the jumbled lore of the games, the various elements it weaves in seem imbalanced and unwieldy. We get flavors of straight horror-thriller, psychological thriller, and supernatural horror; the flick spends just as much or maybe even more time delving into the troubled personal life of protagonist Mike - his past trauma, his shoddy work history, his difficult relationship with his sister, and more. This is all part of a complete story, yes, but in the front end the telling comes across as confused, and in the back end it's overfull and strained as the script tries to neatly tie together all the varied pieces. However much this does or doesn't correlate to the videogame franchise, I think the film maybe just tries to do too much, and it might have benefited from some aspects having been left out.Even with these critiques firmly in mind, however, by and large 'Five nights at Freddy's' is gratifyingly sharp, and it's genuinely better than I could have hoped. It's readily evident how much care went into this from every angle, an endeavor to make the adaptation the best it could be, and to make something that could appeal to all comers. And just so: my friends who are deeply invested in the games told me that they were happy with the picture in terms of its relation to the source material; in my opinion it's solid and satisfying in and of itself as a horror picture. With the Jim Henson Creature Shop having crafted the animatronics, there could never be any doubt that Freddy and his friends look outstanding, and for that matter - not to count out anyone else's contributions, but they might well be the top highlight in these two hours. The stunts, effects, and art direction are top notch, and bring to vibrant life the aesthetics that anyone with passing awareness of the games will recognize in an instant. And while I'm not especially familiar with anyone in the cast, I'm very pleased with just how good the acting is here. Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, and even young Piper Rubio, among others, give meaningful weight and human heart to their characters and in turn to the proceedings; even as the tale oscillates between ideas, the actors serve as an anchor to help keep the title steady amidst any perceived difficulties.It's worth observing that while 'Willy's Wonderland' was an unremitting, unabashed horror-comedy romp, 'The Banana Splits movie' took a different tack and rooted those same flavors in an earnest sidelong exploration of the relationship between mother and child, and the significance of childhood innocence - while also, regrettably, lacking the utmost punch that would have helped its horror or comedy to land. I bring this up because FNAF fits rather neatly between these two spiritual predecessors: more grounded and earnest than the riotous Nicolas Cage vehicle, and boasting more vitality than the Hanna-Barbera blast. The writing team concocted an amalgamated story and a screenplay that try to split the difference between humor, violence, and heartfelt beats, and while none of these are specifically as strong as in the kindred flicks, the result is a fine success all the same, warts and all. For the genre purists in the audience, I would even argue that of the three FNAF might well offer the most pure horror experience. Employing the same finessed, delicate hand that she demonstrated even in first full-length feature 'The wind,' in 2018, or in 2021's 'Blood moon,' director Tammi swirls these facets together as smoothly as she can to keep the whole centered. The carnage may not be as visceral or heavily visualized, the emotional beats may not hit as hard, and the humor may not be as robust as we get elsewhere, yet the combination of them all is admirably sure-footed. Even if I hadn't previously dallied with Tammi's other works, on the basis of this alone I look forward to watching her career develop.For any number of reasons this won't appeal to all, and for any number of reasons it will not meet with equal favor among all. Videogame connoisseur, film buff, \"casual\" appreciator of fiction generally - there are a lot of ways to consider this, and there are a lot of ways it could have gone wrong (and may have, depending on one's perspective). All I know is that I wasn't entirely sure what to expect when I sat in the theater, and even though I don't think it's perfect, the strength it can claim handily outweighs its faults and shortcomings. I had a swell time with this, and think it ably scratches the itch for whatever it is one might want out of horror entertainment. I really am of the mind that it's something anyone could appreciate, whatever level of familiarity with the games one might bring to the viewing experience. It's not something that wholly demands viewership, but it stands tall on its own legs, and if one has any passing interest then it's well worth checking out. 'Five nights at Freddy's' is a minor delight as far as I'm concerned, and I'm glad to give it my recommendation!",
    "108": "Five Nights at Freddy's is a great concept. A person is provided a job as a security guard at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza and things become weirder each night. That sounds like a great horror movie. It's a shame this isn't remotely it.The movie is an actual slog fest that is more focused on adapting the lore, rather than being a competent horror movie. The games are notable for their jump scares and this movie only had 2 which is mind-boggling. I dislike horror movies that are reliant on jump scares but this movie would have actually benefitted if it had more because it was so boring. This movie not being scary at all, is my biggest disappointment. The plot is stupid, the characters are uninteresting, and a lot of the scenes are incredibly goofy (that fort-building scene sticks in my mind).Still, the animatronics look terrific and the set design feels like it was pulled right from the games. It is also filled with easter eggs that fans will love. The sound design is also great and can be quite unsettling. I can see fans liking this movie. However, a YouTube video talking about FNAF lore is more interesting than this.",
    "109": "I was ready to really love this movie having played and been terrorized by the game on occulus, but what a massive let down. It starts out with some horror promise, but this quickly deflates once the main characters and story come into play. My main question was- was this written during the writers strike by stand ins because omg. What. A. Mess. The dialog and acting borders the ridiculous and then pole vaults waaaaay over it once \"Vanessa\" arrives on the scene. What is wrong with this character? Her lines, moods, and acting is ALL over the map! Calm and demure one second, then with her very next sentence is ready to murder. ROFL! People in our theater were laughing after every one of her completely over-the-top lines and not in a good way either. She was an absurd character with almost zero purpose other than to provide poorly written plot exposition and unintentional comedy. \"If you bring Abby back here, I will SHOOT you.\" Comic gold offered up with complete seriousness- this line had our theater in stitches. One of M. Night Shyamalan's over the top disastrous characters would be hard pressed to keep up w/ ol' Vanessa's \"acting\" lol!The rest is a forgettable mess of wretched acting, boring family drama, boring pacing, a needlessly convoluted \"plot\", and lukewarm \"horror\". Honestly this felt like a throwaway movie of the week by a first time director. Nothing to offer. Josh Hutcherson's done much better and it was sad to see him in such a turd of a film. Maybe it will reach cult popularity due to its awfulness and stupidity a-La Rocky Horror, but even that'd be a stretch. Avoid it unless it's streaming and you need to numb your brain.",
    "110": "This looked to be a really good horror and certainly started off well enough, so I began watching in some anticipation.It doesn't take long before you realise this film doesn't know if it's a horror, a ghost story or a suspense thriller (and nor does the audience)As predictable as a Scooby Doo Cartoon (complete with the actor who played shaggy in the film)It ruins the good start with lots of WTF? Plot holes.The big failing is using writers who clearly think the audience are idiots. Who won't ask silly questions like 'how did 5 bodies and all the blood and gore get cleared up? Or this was portrayed as supernatural now it's become mechanical - which is it.The writing is lazy and glib, throw in a nasty auntie because they can't think of any more credible reasons for X and Y to happenIt starts off respectably enough but you soon realise it's garbage . Shame as I think the storyline had real potential.Seeing many of the 10/10 reviews 'best film ever' from first time users confirm my suspicions that reivews are paid for or bogus or both.",
    "111": "First of all, the costumes and the set were great, I didn't have any issue with the acting (big fan of Josh and Matthew) and it was amazing to see the game kind of come to life on screen. I understand that one has to make some modifications to the original source, but I feel like the reason why movies or series made of loved videogames fall short is because they very often become so different from the original source and either add or change story lines that don't require any change, which just makes it weird for the viewer if they happen to be a fan.I think producers and directors should have learnt from the last of us adaptation, since it's one of the most well received adaptations like this. When you make this kind of content for the fans, use the source they already love. I'm probably going to see the second movie if they do end up making it, I'm not gonna lie, because I love the games and I wish the next one would be catered towards the fans who have waited years for this sort of a movie.I think the movie is still worth a watch, esprecially if you go into the movie expecting more of a humoristic spooky movie, don't really care about the details of the games and just want to see the animatronics come to life, I'm sure you'll enjoy it more! I just might have had a bit unrealistic expectations and the hype around the movie got to me.",
    "112": "My oldest son is 10 & has been obsessed with FNAF since he was 5. He has been so excited to see this movie & as parents we were hoping it wouldn't be too gory. This was just the right amount of scary that he didn't want to walk to his room alone, but not enough he didn't need to sleep in my bed afterwards. That's a good level of scare, just enough he enjoyed it, not so much he couldn't watch it.It also was entertaining enough we were able to watch it as a family. Matthew Lillard for the parents, Josh Hutchinson for the kids.Visually the movie was flawless. & All your favorite bits were in the movie! We got to watch this the day before it came out on theaters due to streaming it on Peacock which was also really nice.Overall the entire family was impressed & hoping for a sequel that's just as good!",
    "113": "It was fine until exactly 1 hour and 10 minutes, when the generic exposition cop woman randomly threatened to shoot the main character for no reason whatsoever. Until then I was like \"this is fine - fan service, a predictable insertion of tons of female characters because it's the 2020s, a kids rating, so no violence, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad, so overall - nothing too surprising or bad.\"But yeah, the cringe factor got cranked up so hard in those 5 seconds that I legit stopped watching it, because I lost all interest, this is bad. I should've expected it to be cringe and misandrist considering it's proudly directed by the same woman who made M3gan, I guess, but I did expect some competence.But yeah, overall, it's a really bland and generic movie based on a game that had no lore whatsoever until a youtuber pulled some out of his rear end for views, singlehandedly creating some (bad one).That same youtuber also has a really corny cameo, I guess for the kids to cheer over, but... yeah...Cringe.To be fair, though, the visual presentation is great, and the acting is surprisingly good, at least from the main guy. He goes above and beyond with what he gets to work with - a silly movie with a ridiculous plot - but he carries his weight and shows a great range of emotion throughout. Too bad his efforts were wasted in a movie this bad.",
    "114": "Written by Ian Chandler - November 2, 2023Almost a decade after the first \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" video-game won the attention of the internet, Scott Cawthon finally adapts his beloved horror franchise into a motion picture. Fantasy and fun come to life with its impressive practical effects and even more impressive budget. Even so, the film gets lost when translated from its spooky, but tween friendly games. It, most fatally, completely forgets its most famous trademarks: suspense and jump scares. It should not be expected to be a work of art, but at the very least, the screenplay should not leave all of the heavy-lifting to the production team.As mentioned previously, those who produced the visual aspects of \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" are exceptional on ensuring that the pizzeria is how a fan would imagine it. It's dark, dusty, but also colorful. The technology in the abandoned pizzeria is appropriately dated. Additionally, in an industry so reliant on the use of CGI, it was refreshing to see Freddy and his pals as real animatronics. So much love and care were put into the world Scott Cawthon created that it stings a bit more that the film's other elements are as empty as an animatronics' endoskeleton.The plot is not as bad as it could have been, but it still never feels polished, nor fresh. It features an upsetting story about a sad protagonist, with tragedies brought up throughout. It is accurate in many ways to the plot of the third game; unfortunately, plot points are brought up repeatably without much progression in order to satisfy the nearly two-hour runtime. When plot elements demand for more substance, they are sidelined for the recurring objective put in place, resulting in an abrupt ending overall and a lack of resolution for certain parts that happen near the end. Characters during the first two acts are serviceable with some good acting, most notably from Josh Hutcherson. When the second act starts to close, the dialogue becomes increasingly wooden and the actors try their best to combat the lackluster script by conveying emotion in the tired phrases given to them.Despite the forgettable plot and uneven characters, a horror film can usually stand on two feet if it provides what they promise: suspense. This, strangely, is where the movie is at its weakest. There is not a second where one's heartrate rises, nor is there a moment to cling on to the seat in fear. The animatronics, furthermore, are too expressive compared to their video-game counterparts; this results in impressive facial movements, but a less impressive method of intimidation. Part of what made the games creepy was their lack of visual movement and their corpse-like faces. The violent sequences, however, are creative, given the fact it is appropriately aimed at younger teenagers. Gore is obscured with clever shadows, impacts are reasonably cut at the last second to not only censor, but also to keep it from appearing cheesy. When it does not remember to cut at the right time, the result is usually very silly; which could possibly be the point when regarding its 1980s theme.\"Five Nights at Freddy's,\" almost seems purposeful in its lack of creepiness as tonal inconsistencies emerge as an enormous problem. About halfway in, the film turns from a slightly unsettling adventure into a tone reminiscent of a bubbly montage found in many Chuck-e-Cheese home videos. It's inorganic, and any suggestion of a spine-chilling blockbuster evaporates at this point. It almost suggests that multiple drafts of the film were sloppily merged together. It attempts to tread back to perilous moments later on, but interest in the unfinished plot is alarmingly small by the time it gets there.With all of that said, \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" is better than any movie about a point-and-click game has any right to be. It is simply bothersome that it could have been drastically more enjoyable had the plot added more depth and the atmosphere remain similar to its source material. It is about guaranteed that the film will receive an endless supply of sequels, with a spark of hope that it only goes up from here. This first entry, however, does not make a good impression for the franchise going forward. If the screenwriter were to be changed for a more experienced one, improvements could be of large proportions.Five Nights at Freddy's - 56/100\"Five Nights at Freddy's\" may have the fantasy going for it, but the removal of scares and fun prevent it from truly coming to life.",
    "115": "(Coming from a huge fan of the games) FNAF is a horror game with a very disturbing backstory. The pixelated moment with springtrap in game was a lot scarier than the live action scene, how is that even possible? It felt like a kids movie. Very very disappointing as I have been waiting for a FNAF movie for sooo many years now. After the movie ended, everyone at the cinema just left quietly with no applause, screams of excitement or even a happy face even tho there were a lot of fans. They just made a cliche horror movie with the animatronics: little kid drawing, talking to imaginary friends and nobody believes her etc. The movie was about some family drama not about surviving the night. The security guard was pretty much in no danger and he was sleeping all the nights and dreaming about the kids. There were not even any doors that he would have had to close if they get too close. It was literally a night guard duty job with nothing happening other than bad dreams... Later on he brought his sister there as there was literally no threat there and she wanted to go. There was even a scene where the animatronics were building a chair fort together and being best friends... I had no idea FNAF could be so unscary even tho the animatronics were very well done. In the very end they became dangerous to them but you really couldnt care less if anyone died and the animatronics just werent even a bit scary anymore. They also tried to put some lame jokes around for no reason. Knowing how disturbing, scary and unique the original games are im just wondering why they decided to make it a cliche \"horror\" movie that has been done a million times already. Nothing made sense. They could have made such an awesome movie with the concept of the games like having the guard trying to piece together whats happening, checking the cameras, having to save power and actually surviving... They could have had some scary flashbacks as he is figuring out what happened and showing the horror that the kids witnessed and went through and getting more insane knowing he might suffer the same fate. Could have been such a terrifying horror movie perfect for halloween and for fans but nah... I am extremely sad to leave such a review but its just the truth.",
    "116": "I don't have a lot to say other than that I haven't seen a video game adaptation this bad since Paul W. S Anderson's Resident Evil series. I don't really want to fill this entire review bubble up but I would HIGHLY suggest avoiding the theater for this one, it's a mess and a big one at that. It has way too many plot holes and pacing problems that it's unbearable to sit through- the acting from Hutcherson and Lillard is good, but I cannot say the same for the rest of the cast whatsoever.Incredibly underwhelming and worst of all: not scary, whatsoever. This film's tone was back and fourth and I couldn't believe what I was watching for nearly forty minutes.As far as adaptations go, it's bad, and I mean really bad. It's own story felt completely rewritten by Hollywood executives and not Scott himself, and it's just disappointing to such an extent that it's hard to imagine Scott even had a hand in any of this whatsoever because I couldn't imagine him being ok with the final results.Of course there's the PG-13 issue but this is something I somewhat anticipated (the games were never hyper violent nor gory, just dark material as far as storyline goes) but it's held back so much by dropping the violence in favor of weak jumpscares- it's disappointing to say the least.I dunno guys, I couldn't recommend spending nearly $12 to go and see this in the theaters- luckily we caught this on Peacock but it's really not worth admission for what you're expecting. Is it cool seeing the animatronics? Absolutely. Is it frightening and dark like the games were? Nope. Is the story just like the games? Nope.Look, take it as you will but it's just not worth your money. It's disappointing and I think the best part out of it all was Corey and that's all I could gather from it.",

So this movie should be right up my ally right? Well not in this case. The movie focuses on hitting that feature film length so much that you get a jumbled story with so much going on that the movie ends up just leaving you behind. Oh and Animatronics we're great for the 5 minutes they were on screen.The characters are not interesting at all and that's a shame because we are stuck following the main character Mike through un interesting repetitive dream sequences that lead to nothing. The others acted in such an non human way, it throws you out of the illusion.This movie had a story already written out that scared so many people already, why they didn't just stick to that and flesh out the already told story is beyond me.

Having played FNAF since it first came out in 2014, I was so excited to see the adaptation for the movie 9 years later. If you are like me, DO NOT get your hopes up.The movie plot had potential, but was boiled down to a cheesy thriller that had maybe four or five callbacks to the incredibly extensive lore that Scott Cawthon established over the years with the Five Night's at Freddy's game series. I believe the PG-13 rating suits it perfectly- very VERY little gore, no drugs, no drinking, etc. So, if you are watching for the story-line alone, I would say it's not a good watch for you unless you are a younger teenager looking for a fun thriller with a few scary scenes.The visuals, however, were INCREDIBLE. Truly, I could not imagine a better real-life interpretation of the animatronics. You can look up the animatronic pictures online and get a good feel of how amazing they are. Not sure I would recommend the movie for the visuals.Overall, Five Night's at Freddy's is an incredibly below average thriller film with phenomenal visuals.
