    "0": "Poor Things tells the story of animated woman with her baby's brain. She develop conscience and slowly carved herself into womanhood with some few man getting on her way.The First two thirds of the film works really well.Emma, Rufallo, Ramy Youssef were marvelous in their respective role.You could feel that Yorgos really camped it up and could see how he was enjoying the material. The visual game too in these portion is through the roof. All the jokes were hitting well. AND while do feel weird thinking that this is a baby trying to heck out of her loins, the most important thing about this is that there is a constant growth in Stone's character. She develops a childlike confidence in her ideas AND develop empathy. AND even gives some pointed observation of the questionable people around him.But something went south after the Paris scene.Everything that it is heading towards suddenly felt very empty.I just do not know if Emma's character is representing everything at all. Suddenly, all her growth just felt surface level. She wants everything and just gets everything. It became that 'Genius'\nplot AND it seems to lose track of what she really represent. It just became pure fantasia without any kind or semblance of a stakes. She just wants, and she gets. That really bothered me, since then film is positioned that she killed herself because she feels stifled by the her husband and his controlling ways.Its a liberation alright BUT it does not know what is she being liberated from. She just is free BUT with everything free to begin with.Overall, a great setup that fails to stick its landing. Overhyped.",
    "1": "The story is so bizarre and what occurs can only be explained as a chaos of emotions but the movie translates that into one of the best coming of age stories I have ever seen. Emma Stone is the star of this movie. She carries the movie's bizarre scenes and dives fully into the this chaotic character. The movie does not shy away from its R rating and challenges the audience on what to feel during those moments. The supporting cast is just as weird and quirky in all the best ways. Mark Ruffalo especially is almost unrecognizable from his recent roles but is a lovable stand out and is usually the centerpiece of many of the jokes of the movie. This is a must watch for its original story and beautiful world it creates.",
    "2": "While he is unmistakably a unique voice in cinema, I'm not as big of a fan of Yorgos Lanthimos as many critics and cinephiles tend to be. I sometimes feel that his films focus more on attempting to provoke and shock the viewer rather than, and at the expense of, putting compelling storytelling first. While his quirky and risqué new film \"Poor Things\" doesn't completely overcome that concern, it is a step in the right direction from a storytelling perspective. An occasionally rudderless plot and some not very well developed supporting characters prevents it from being a home run, but it's still a solid film that should please independent film lovers who know what they're getting themselves into.The film centers on Bella Baxter, a woman who is brought back to life with the brain of her baby by Goodwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe, who Bella refers to as \"God.\") The movie primarily centers around Bella's development and autonomy as she begins to understand the world around her, including her relationships with two very different men and her gradual questioning of her purpose and desire for liberation within the confines of a patriarchal society, particularly as it relates to sex. Despite some darker undertones, this premise has plenty of fodder for humor, which Lanthimos delivers. There is deadpan and screwball-style humor in various places throughout the film that feels clever and incisive, although some jokes feel a bit too forced or repetitive. The jokes and writing are complemented by the performances, which are generally very good but not always optimally effective in displaying a strong range. Emma Stone is great, however, as Bella. The supporting cast is generally good, including Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe and Ramy Youssef, although I would not necessarily say any of them uniquely stand out. What does stand out within the confines of the narrative, however, is the film's stunning production design of fantastical Victorian Europe, which is stunning to look at and combines a variety of unique aesthetic choices and color palettes to great success. The film probably didn't need to be nearly two and a half hours long, and some scenes feel a bit dragged out or lacking in purpose, yet the outrageous and blackly comic tone accentuated by the bold stylistic choices on display here make the film a worthwhile viewing experience. Recommended to those okay with graphic sexual material. 7/10.",
    "3": "'Poor Things' is... weird and hard to fully explain. It has elements of sci-fi, Frankenstein, romance, comedy and drama, as well as oddly framed camera angles, lots of fish-eye lens and keyhole shots. It follows Bella (Stone) and her \"father\"/creator, Godwin (Dafoe, who does well to still be able to act in his mask), Bella's fiancée Max (Youssef) and fling Duncan (Ruffalo). The films technically set in the 19th century, but in a fictional world.We follow Bella as she grows and learns what the world's about, through 6 distinct acts - London, Lisbon, Alexandria, Paris and London again. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that Godwin is a faux Frankenstein/Geppetto, w with Bella his Frankenstein's Monster/Pinocchio. While the first 40min is all black & white, it establishes that we're in a fantastical/un-real world and enables what follows to not be too jarring. Once Bella gains independence, her and Duncan go on a trip and we're back in colour and there's lots of nods to Wes Anderson.There is a lot of sex and nudity from Stone, as Bella explores her sexuality. It often adds to the story, but not always. Stone is excellent as Bella, giving her a peculiar gait and way of talking to always make sure you know the character is not a normal adult. Ruffalo has some fun moments, and Dafoe's always good, making Godwin into an empathetic character. I didn't love the score and some of the cinematography, although the sky when they're on the boat is captivating. At 140min, it's probably 30min too long and while different, it with sometimes feels like odd things are thrown in just for oddness' sake.",
    "4": "Let's start with the obvious: the film is visually captivating and every performance is stellar. The world Lanthimos builds around Bella Baxter is gorgeous and unique. Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo are definitely at their best here. Willem Defoe's performance is wonderful as well. You could feel through the screen that the cast had so much fun making this film.That said... the story, the dialogue, the point? If there was one? All fell flat for me. It felt like weirdness for the sake of weirdness. Firstly, let's really think about the story for a moment. A mad scientist finds a pregnant woman teetering in the space between life and death, and brings her back to consciousness by putting her unborn baby's brain in her skull. In the beginning of the film, Bella is like a toddler. Breaking things, throwing tantrums, walking funny. Then one day out of nowhere she starts playing with herself and becomes sex-obsessed. This is... questionable. Concerning. Was weird to watch as a pregnant woman myself. Okay, I thought, just an awkward part of our protagonist's development. NOPE! The rest of the film is centered around her sexual escapades. First playing with herself, then using an apple for her sexual pleasure, then asking her fiancé to \"do\" her, then running off with a colleague of her father's because he gropes her w/o consent and she likes it, then becoming a prostitute to make money in Paris. The sex scenes in the film are frequent, raw, graphic, and really hard to watch. (keep in mind that she's supposed to have the mind of a child!)About halfway through Bella Baxter's time in Paris, my husband and I were considering walking out. And we're not prude or anything- we saw Saltburn a few weeks ago and thought it was so fun. We walked out of Poor Things, looked at each other, and rolled our eyes. I was left feeling like a lot of Bella's potential was left unexplored, like her desire to learn, become a surgeon, understand what lead to her suicide, etc. All of those things were an afterthought compared to her interest in what she calls \"furious jumping\".Three stars for the visuals and the acting. As for the whole package? Disappointing and vastly overrated.",
    "5": "First of all, I can't express how happy I'm to be among the lucky ones having the opportunity to watch something so special before the official release and all that thanks to the organizers of Cinelibri IFF who brought the movie in my country Bulgaria just after its screening at NYFF and six other prestigious festivals. So if somehow somebody of the organizers of the festival see this, I'm so grateful, it was a special night and even the idiots in the public couldn't ruin it for me. That's what we should see in Bulgarian cinemas. Anyway, now to the point.One is certain, this is a movie that is not just one of the hottest and most successful films of the year, but a movie that instantly becomes part of cinematic history. It's so beautiful and accurate in capturing a person's development and clashing with the world. I won't be able to describe the professional means used to accomplish the whole experience, but ones you see it, it's impossible not to feel it. At the same time, the movie is definitely not pretentious in any way, regardless of the depths of the philosophical problems that it covers - live, death, faith, God, poverty, social classes, inequality of sexes, trauma, love and etc. It is so normal in its own abnormality which for me is making it so special and close to my heart. And, of course, the humor. Don't know if there is such a thing as your type of humor, but if it exists, this definitely is mine. And everything is brought to life(literally in this case) by these talented, talented people - the actors.I'm sure this type of movie will bring broad audience among which way more eloquent and experienced people than me who will have something more appropriate to say about the movie(not to mention the critics reviews that are already available), but I believe that shouldn't stop me from trying to express what something so special made me feel and think about. I can't wait for the world to see it and me with all the people. Again. And again.",
    "6": "Funny and artistically beautiful, but left me feeling a bit uncomfortable seeing the heavy portrayal of infantilism amongst adult males who spent the entire movie lusting over a grown woman with a child-like whimsy. I really thought the storyline was going to morph into more of a piece on woman's autonomy, especially with Emma Stone promoting this story as the definition of what it means to be a woman, but it never really got there for me. Though Bella wanting to engage in frequent sex is a celebration of the female arousal and orgasm, it felt unsettling seeing her unbalanced walk and inability to form completely sentences be paired with the very graphic sex scenes in the first half of the movie (not that I have any gripes against sex scenes, the more the merrier. I just don't want toddler talk killing the mood). I felt that the whole film centered around her male-desired innocence but didn't do anything with it to follow back to the \"feminist\" story this film was to advertised to portray. Personally, there was too much adult themes involving children/child-minded people for my liking (young boys watching her have sex?) and it was a huge distraction for me throughout my viewing. I kept saying to myself \"I must have missed something\" when thinking back and trying to justify why it was okay for Duncan (Mark Ruffalo) to find Bella playing in a closet and put his hand between her legs when, at that point, she was clearly still portraying a young child's actions.I really did want to love this film, since literally everything else was right up my alley- Cast, Cinematography, Score, Costume Design, it had it all; in the end it just wasn't complete package for me.",
    "7": "I thought with all the main actors and several previews this had the potential to be really good. What an all time low for Emma Stone flaunting around naked half the movie. This was basically female Frankenstein plus porn got you this film. Not any part of it was good or even entertaining. I see all sorts of derranged movie and this was absolutely pointless. I would highly recommend saving your money and seeing something else. But mixing several good movies together to make one incredibly terrible movie is not the way to go. This was slow long boring depressing and a stupid ending. I can't say enough to skip it.",
    "8": "\"Poor Things\" is a captivating cinematic experience that delves into the complexities of life, love, and societal expectations. Directed by Renowned Director X, the film takes inspiration from Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name but adds a cinematic flair that elevates the narrative to new heights. The movie boasts a stellar cast, including Oscar-winning actors and rising stars, who deliver performances that breathe life into their characters.The storyline follows Bella Baxter, portrayed by the talented Lead Actress Y, a woman with a mysterious past who undergoes a transformative surgery, resurrecting her into a new, vibrant existence. As the narrative unfolds, we are taken on a journey through Bella's tumultuous life, exploring themes of identity, agency, and the consequences of playing god.One of the film's strengths lies in its thought-provoking screenplay, penned by Screenwriter Z. The dialogue is sharp, infused with wit and humor that provides a necessary balance to the darker undertones of the narrative. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the audience to absorb the nuances of each character and the intricacies of the plot.",
    "9": "Director Yorgos Lanthimos takes us on a captivating journey with \"Poor Things.\" Emma Stone's portrayal of Bella is nothing short of mesmerizing. The character's evolution is beautifully captured through the director's unique visual style and rich textures. Lanthimos delivers a thought-provoking experience that leaves the audience deeply engaged.Additionally, Emma Stone and Mark Ruffalo truly deserve their Oscar nominations for Best Actors in \"Poor Things.\" Their performances are nothing short of brilliant and bring depth to the characters. The film's soundtrack, sound editing, costume design, and production design are all equally amazing, contributing to the overall excellence of this cinematic gem. \"Poor Things\" is a masterclass in storytelling and filmmaking that deserves recognition at the highest level.",
    "10": "I was never shocked or surprised by the film, it just felt like it was trying to be bizarre for the hell of it. It felt like they could never settle on an age Bella Baxter was supposed to be, the music was so sharp and painful to listen to, I didn't care about the characters, it felt like there was no point to so many scenes - like the dad showing the kids how to have sex. And then in the end she says she's gonna save her ex-husband and then instead turns him into a goat. It's a very bizarre and pointless film. It seems like the film was trying to be a dark comedy, but it ended up being more of a nightmare. I did like Ruffalo and Usseff's characters a lot in totally opposite ways. I appreciated the dark, introspective moments the film had, but they only went so far into that. I saw it opening night at the theatre and could feel the disengagement from the audience. Walking out afterwards there was a lot of murmurs of disappointment.",
    "11": "I had high hopes knowing that this was a Yorgos film, but was also hesitant because not all of his films I loved... However, this might have been the best film he's done so far. Emma Stone is a scene stealer. If she doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination for this role, I'd be stunned. Stunning set design, cinematography, use of colors, and overall, fantastic story on feminism. Highly recommend this to anyone, though I feel most people would either love this or hate this. Plenty of laughs, but also plenty of endearing moments that truly make you think. Yorgos is an auteur, and I look forward to his future films.",
    "12": "Excellent works should really win the oscar. The visual effect is better than that of Marvel movies. There are many elements you want to express, but they are not messy at all. The best work in the film in the past two years, the best soundtrack, the best costume design, the best performance, the best photography, and everything is an excellent work.Everything in the film is novel and unprecedented. It is not just feminism, but the director wants to express more, including intellectualism, cognition of self-body, motherhood, socialism, and slave society. All this is so real, but it turned out to be a fantasy film. When the heroine stopped to enjoy the music, I once cried. I cried and laughed at the same time in this masterpiece.",

    "14": "This blew me out of the water. I had been waiting for this film for a year and when I finally got the chance to go see it at my local film festival, in a fact I didn't get tickets at first but then some people cancelled and I got those tickets and boy, this film is the best of the year. Make-up, art design, background design was all amazing. All of the actors did an phenomenonal job but some standouts to me were, obviously Emma Stone, William DeFoe, Ramy Youssef and Mark Ruffalo. The fact that they some things in this film are just so interesting and the way the capture Bella's growth as a character is just all to the screenwriter Tony McNamara. Yorgos Lanthimos uses some of the most interesting camera styles I have ever seen. All in all this is a standout film and I will never forget it.",
    "15": "Worst movie I have ever seen. My wife and I got up and left mid move as both of us were completely done. This movie is straight aweful. It's as if artsy people decided to make a movie and it was as terrible as possible. Movie starts out roughy in black and white. Has numerous sex scenes for no reason and then continues to get worse. It's absolutely not a movie worth seeing or one that I would recommend to anyone. Dialogue was limited at best. The \"artsy ness\" wasn't impressive and lacked depth and the plot line sucked. I would be straight mad if i had paid to go see this out of pocket. Go see anything else.",
    "16": "While quite an accomplishment deserving of praise, Poor Things is a challenging movie to recommend as it is in many ways very uncomfortable viewing . . . Which I'm guessing is part of the point. The pros are that it is beautifully shot, with very unique camera perspectives; has some very funny at moments; and the lead character played by Stone is fearless and shows tremendous growth throughout the film. However, it will be hard for many to get past the vulgerness, gratuitous violence and sex, callousness of the characters, and plot points that challenges moral code. While I think the film maker handled many of these concepts brilliantly while managing to successfully express clear messages of despair, hopelessness, and personal growth, the gratuity is pushed in excess to a point where the message becomes muddled in the shock value. A couple sitting next to me in the theater walked out in the first 10 minutes. By the end, I was mesmerized and touched, but I think it could have been trimmed down to be both more tasteful and clearer in its overall message.",
    "17": "Yorgos Lanthimos's latest film is bonkers in the best way possible, and extremely naughty, but it somehow left me a bit cold anyway.Emma Stone plays the film's Frankenstein's monster, a woman who (gasp!) wants independence and freedom, sexual and otherwise, without having to live her life by rules established by men. It's a loud and proud shout for female autonomy for those who found the bubble gum atmosphere of \"Barbie\" a bit too perky. But it's also disappointingly on the nose and literal and didn't take the central allegory as far out as I would have liked.The film looks amazing. Huge kudos to the production designers who create a stylized version of the world as it existed a century or so ago.The film's biggest asset is its acting, especially the central performance by Emma Stone, who has to play a grown woman with the brain of a baby, and then show us that woman growing into her brain (or maybe show us the baby growing into the woman?) over the course of the film.I admired this film a lot, but there is something clinical about it that prevented me from warming to it completely. It's like Lanthimos approached the film in the same way the mad scientist played by Willem Dafoe in the movie approaches his medical experiments -- with a cool eye and a lot of curiosity, but very little heart.Grade: A-",
    "18": "Every facet of Poor Things is odd, quirky, and unsettling--and intentionally so. This area is a well-known powerhouse for director Yorgos Lanthimos, and perhaps what is most impressive about it is how smartly crafted everything comes together, from the way various shots are framed all the way down to the witty dialogue and expressions moment to moment. Even the music theme is in a frequent pitch-bend, with each twing grating our ears with discomfort like the insidious Midsommar score by Bobby Krlic. This one goes even deeper down the rabbit hole than The Favourite, with hysterical running gags, fisheye lens, mad science, outrageous characters, and stunning set and costume design as if from a lavish Michel Gondry period piece.The story has strong vibes of Voltaire's Candide, as the protagonist, a beautiful, young, naive woman, takes an optimistic dive headfirst into a nightmarish world of men and propriety. Emma Stone is tasked to portray a wide range of mental acuity for her character, given a science fiction aspect of the film's premise (one that becomes less and less shocking the more we explore the world around it). It features peak Willem Dafoe, in a memorable role that just seems written entirely for him, and Mark Ruffalo, who expertly plays one of the more overtly satirical figures in the film. The degree to which these three (and others) commit to and embrace the absurdity of their roles in this world is a big part of why everything works as well as it does.Runtime is 2 hours 21 minutes, yet there is not a dull moment in the film not worth rewatching. You get invested in this wild tale and will not want it to end. It delivers raw, bold, scathing critiques on class, shame, sex, abuse, and dependence--all in impeccably awkward and satirically brilliant form. Like many of his films before it, Poor Things is a robust package of truths about ourselves that are as embarrassing to witness as they are impossible to deny. Yorgos delivers yet another remarkable film of the highest quality. If you've enjoyed his other films, I would not miss this one.",
    "19": "\"Poor Things\" is a spellbinding tale that catapults the audience into the fantastical evolution of Bella Baxter, a young woman brought back to life by the brilliant and unorthodox scientist, Dr. Godwin Baxter. This film is nothing short of a hero's journey, meticulously crafted into a new frame, and one can't help but imagine Mary Shelley reveling in the sheer audacity of it all.The filmmaking prowess displayed in \"Poor Things\" is nothing short of remarkable. Directorial choices, cinematography, and a hauntingly beautiful score come together seamlessly to create an immersive experience that captivates from the very beginning. The film dares to tread into unexplored territories, blending elements of science fiction, drama, and dark comedy with astonishing finesse.Emma Stone's performance in \"Poor Things\" is nothing short of a revelation. With nuance and depth, Stone breathes life into Bella Baxter, delivering one of the most captivating performances ever witnessed on screen. Her ability to convey the complex emotions of a character grappling with the very essence of existence is a testament to her exceptional acting prowess.At its core, \"Poor Things\" is a compelling exploration of what it means to truly live. As Bella navigates her newfound existence, the audience is taken on a journey that challenges preconceived notions of life, morality, and the boundaries of scientific intervention. The narrative is richly layered, and the script masterfully weaves together humor, philosophy, and poignant moments, offering viewers a thought-provoking experience.It's important to note that \"Poor Things\" might not be for everyone. Its unique blend of genres and the exploration of existential themes may polarize audiences. However, for those willing to venture into the extraordinary, the film rewards with a storytelling brilliance that transcends conventional norms.In conclusion, \"Poor Things\" stands as a cinematic triumph. It pushes boundaries, challenges expectations, and delivers an unforgettable experience. Emma Stone's stellar performance, coupled with the film's daring narrative, makes it a must-watch for those seeking a thought-provoking and visually stunning journey into the realms of life, death, and everything in between. Beyond brilliant, \"Poor Things\" is a testament to the power of storytelling and the magic that unfolds when a talented cast and crew come together to create something truly extraordinary.",
    "20": "\"She's like nothing you've ever seen\"The same can be said for this film, which I saw at Film Fest Gent in a packed theater. It was the 5th film of the day for all of us there, but the audience was lively and exuberant. And it's no wonder, since Poor Things is nothing short of a monumental achievement: it is at once the funniest, smartest, best looking and most entertaining film of 2023. With its radical inventiveness and audacious creativity, this masterpiece may turn out to be viewed as a cinematic milestone by future generations. At the very least, Poor Things is Yorgos Lanthimos' magnum opus and deserving of instant classic status.The plot outline for Poor Things could be described as Frankenstein with a modern, feminist twist, with Godwin 'God' Baxter (William Dafoe) assuming the role of the doctor who brings Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) back from the dead. As an adult woman equipped with the brain of an infant, Bella is blessed with the intense curiosity and sense of wonder that only a newborn can have. She quickly develops a will of her own and it isn't long before she escapes her imposed confinement (shades of Lanthimos' debut film Dogtooth) by running off with smarmy lawyer Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo) on a journey of exploration of both herself and the world.I cannot say enough about the breathtaking cinematography and spectacular production design of this film, which is quite frankly atypical of what I'd had to come expect from a Lanthimos film. Not that his previous films have looked bad, but \"visually striking\" is just not what pops up first when calling to mind his films. The first act, which takes place at Dr. Baxter's mansion, is filmed in gorgeous black and white (a nod to the original Frankenstein adaptation perhaps?) and already displays some bold artistic choices, such as the frequent use of fish-eye lenses to create distorted images. But it is once Bella embarks on her adventure into the outside world that we realize we're not in Kansas anymore. Stunning visuals of luscious sets and amazing costumes in impossibly vivid colors light up the screen, as we discover an exaggeratedly artificial world through Bella's perspective, being one of childlike bewilderment.Emma Stone gives a career-defining performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet her, Bella is less a person than a stumbling 'creature' equipped with the vocabulary of a child. Stone does an excellent job of portraying Bella's development towards becoming a 'real person', by gradually improving her grasp of language and her manner of walking, to name just a couple of things. She also convincingly sells the incredible character arc that Bella goes through during this film. It's a physically and mentally demanding role, the kind of performance they usually hand out Oscars for.William Dafoe is perfectly cast as mad scientist Godwin Baxter, who looks more like the monster of Frankenstein than the doctor that created him. Dafoe unsurprisingly does a fantastic job here, knowingly leaning into the absurdity of the story with some of his delivery, but still playing his character sincerely.A special mention has to go to Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn here, the impossibly suave globetrotter and self-proclaimed ladykiller who brings temptation into Bella's life and takes her into the wide world. Ruffalo chews the scenery, playing Wedderburn almost as a parody of the archetypical smooth womanizer and delivering his lines with visible glee. But his histrionics actually suit the arc of his character perfectly, as he is eventually driven to utter madness by Bella's insatiable taste for sexual and intellectual exploration and the often irrefutable logic she uses to explain her actions and dismiss his complaints.However, Poor Things doesn't only overwhelm with its abundance of style and larger-than-life performances, it has something to say too. As Bella, with the voraciousness a child, develops a taste for both sexual and intellectual gratification, the film cleverly uses her unbiased perspective to ask seemingly logical questions about some of the the established gender roles and class roles she perceives in the world around her. Who would have thought that Yorgos Lanthimos, the Greek director known for his idiosyncratic style, which often expresses a cynical worldview through pitch-black, deadpan comedy, would be the one to deliver not only the most visually dazzling film of 2023, but also the most piercing critique of the patriarchy and established gender roles? (looking at you there, Barbie)Time will tell if Poor Things will be heralded as the game changer that I personally envision it to be, but at the very least we can just be happy that such a defiantly original and wonderfully creative film was made to be consumed by a mainstream audience here in 2023. As long as this kind of uniquely cinematic experience continues to exist, we can look optimistically at the future of the medium. Go see this film!",
    "21": "Hilarious, bizarre and a philosophically very dark comedy - cinema at its finest!I just watched this film at the Biennale Festival in Venice and I'm totally mesmerized by it: This is as good as cinema can get!!!The film dares to ask boldly all the deepest und most relevant questions in our life.A philosophical journey of questioning the established values of the society, the concept of morality and the true meaning of life itself. An absolutely brilliant performance, especially by Emma Stone (I'm quite sure she will win an Oscar for this!), a fantastic set and costume design, I'm not even getting started on storytelling, cinematography and editing... Oh Yorgos oh Yorgos!I would love to watch it again immediately as soon as it is out in theaters.PS: I have only one wish regarding music: Tom Waits would have gone very well with this. In my head Tom was playing while I watched the film.",
    "22": "Based on Alasdair Gray's novel of the same name, \"Poor Things\" focuses on Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a Victorian-era woman resurrected by an experimental doctor (Willem Defoe) through a macabre series of circumstances. Bella, who knows the doctor merely as \"God\", begins to regain her physical faculties and psychologically develop, and seeks to explore the outside world with varied outcomes.Stone reunites with Yorgos Lanthimos here after their stellar collaboration in \"The Favourite\", and the result is impressive for a number of reasons. The \"Frankenstein\"-esque plot of the film is shot through with a mean streak of eccentric (and at times quite dark) humor that mostly hinges on Bella's developing grasp on language and social norms. In the beginning, as she is introduced to God's protege, Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef), Bella is infantile in demeanor and coordination, but as she \"grows\" so to speak, her clunky use of English creates a number of hilarious lines that Stone delivers impeccably. As she is taken under the wing of a selfish and corrupt attorney (Mark Ruffalo) and becomes his lover, the character is springboarded into a number of adventures that have a \"Gulliver's Travels\" sort of nature about them.Of course none of this would work well if the screenplay were weak, but the writing and dialogue here is whipsmart and witty. As it progresses, Bella's perverse origins come further into focus, and she begins to analyze humanity and the cultural customs around her through an at-times painfully objective lens. It goes without saying that Stone carries the film on her shoulders, but Ruffalo, Defoe, and Youssef also give uniformly strong performances and lend these characters a robustness that matches that of the lively, guileless Bella.Visually, the film is sublime: It appropriately begins in gothic black-and-white and utilizes fisheye lenses and a number of other period visual flairs before it shifts into full color, where the surreal Victorian-meets-futurism locales feel both ancient and almost Disney-like. While the thematic content here is dark in nature, \"Poor Things\" is probably Lathimos's most charming work to date--and I'm not sure I can really think of anything about it that I did not like, which rarely happens. 10/10.",

It's artsy fartsy silly, sorry!Not any good? This movie really looks the part! The photography is out of whack, but in a beautiful, dreamlike way. The intrusive soundscore falls in the same category. And so do the acting performances, who more resemble dream like sequences than anything understandable. It's masterfully created, beautiful to watch. Respect. (BUT... artsy fartsy silly)More good: Emma Stone definitely delivers with her quirky performance. We get to see Emma Stone transform from a cute looking zombie into a more humanlike being, who discovers what's it like to have sex for the first time, like other human beings for instance. More trivial human \"experiences\" like Emma Stone discovering what \"eating\" is like are quite amusing to watch as well. (BUT.... still artsy fartsy SILLY)Ultimately this movie disappointed me, because however weird a story or it's characters are, somewhere in a story there needs to be something or someone I can relate too or sympathize with. And there is NONE...Because of the absurdity of the enitre story AND it's characters, this movie left me cold, but as I said before, some folks will love it to pieces, and many more though will be only raising their eyebrows and be quite bored with it...",

There is something so wonderful about the weird, especially in art.Emma Stone's performance as Bella Baxter was just glorious. It's also a very \"risky\" performance because when we first meet her, she is a child in an adult body after being reanimated, with her vocabulary being on the same level as a three-year-old, and her uneven body posture/moments, as if she's still learning how to move. There is A famous movie saying, \"Never go full stupid\", but Stone finds the right balance that prevents it from being embarrassing to watch, which other actors failed at. However, that section is only at the beginning, and as the film progresses through her journey of becoming herself, we see her understanding of language and walking improve significantly.Bella is a fantastic main character, and she's easy to care about. We want to see her succeed, and Emma Stone was terrific.This is the best performance I have seen from Mark Ruffalo, as every time he was on screen, the audience and I were laughing. His character is a loudmouth parody of the ladykiller, who takes Bella under his wing and has her for himself. He chewed up the scenery, and it was astounding. There is a scene in this movie where both Bella and he have a chaotic dance, but the little dance he does on his way to the dance floor, I can't stop thinking about it. It was so funny.William Dafoe, which should come as no surprise, delivers a superb performance as the monster-looking scientist Godwin Baxter. He is often referred to as 'God' at times, with his patchwork flesh of a face having a distant cross on the right side of his face. He very much plays the role of God, as he does the impossible and gives new life to unfortunate lost souls.I'm just saying this right now, but the Best Supporting Actor race next year might be the best if nothing ruins it. I hope not. Imagine this: Robert Downey Jr. For Oppenheimer, Ryan Gosling for Barbie, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Ruffalo & Dafoe for Poor Things.Everything on a technical level, such as cinematography, the score, costumes, and the production design - all extraordinary and benefited in bringing this world alive. The whole movie feels otherworldly and timeless.What I find compelling about director Yorgos Lanthimos is that if you examine his movies, the stories in his movies are simple. The Lobster is about fulfilling societal norms we feel we need to follow, such as getting a job, applying to a college and university, being with a romantic partner, having kids, having interests, and eventually dying. The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a horror revenge tale where a family gets cursed after the fathers' wrongdoings. The Favourite is a period piece drama/comedy about two reveals who try to win the love of a bipolar queen.Poor Things is a fresh re-imaging of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (also based on a novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray), remodeled as a coming-of-age story told through a female perspective. The needs, the wants, the issues, and losing our inner child in this demanding world. Unique and isn't afraid to approach sexuality so openly.At the start, the character of Bella has the mind of a child while having an adult body but is not restricted and not insecure about things. She can be loud, messy, playful, and expressive in emotions. Especially when it comes to sexuality, hence the openness to it. Like, there's nothing wrong with something that everyone does, but we don't talk about it. As we get older and more exposed to the world, we get quieter, speak less, get insecure about things, care too much about what others may say/think, and become closeted. That is one angle of the film that I found incredibly compelling.But the execution is wild. I do not buy for one second that it's strange for the sake of it. It leans more into steampunk absurdism. Yorgos Lanthimos presents the events as they are without questioning them, as the surface level normality peeled back, and focuses on the strange happenings in life and people. He's one of the most unique voices in cinema, not only for what he has to say but what he must show and how to show it.The only issue I had with the film was towards the end when it started to get a bit preachy, going as far as hitting you on the head with it, and I was thinking, \"Alright, I get it.\"Other than that, the film was excellent and one of the most unique and memorable experiences I had this year. Even if this is Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film so far, it may still be too much for some, but even with its peculiar nature, you will find it impossible to take your eyes off the screen.",
    "25": "It's set in a fantastical Victorian England, with journeys to Lisbon, Spain, Alexandria, Egypt, Paris, France and the ships in between. It follows the work of Dr. Godwin Baxter (Willem Dafoe), a brilliant but eccentric doctor who can transplant brains and other bodily parts. He was experimented upon by his father and has an appearance not unlike Frankenstein's monster. One of his creations is Bella Baxter (Emma Stone), a pregnant young woman who had attempted suicide by jumping off a bridge. Although he knows nothing of her past, \"God,\" as his students refer to him, transplants her still-living fetus's brain into Emma's dead brain. His medical assistant is Max McCandles (Ramy Youssef).The movie follows Emma's growth as she develops language skills beginning with infancy, with physical coordination occurring at a different pace and understanding sexuality, emotion, and human relationships at still different rates. Godwin and Max try to control her behavior tightly. Godwin's scoundrel lawyer, Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), makes off with Emma, claiming to give her freedom to explore the world. As Emma matures, she makes more and more of her own decisions about her life, even when someone from her past life suddenly appears.\"Poor Things\" is a bizarre movie with no undergirding significance for me. There's inordinate attention to Bella's sexuality to the exclusion of other parts of her personality, leaving me feeling that Emma Stone was unnecessarily exploited. There are many creative images (e.g., composite animals), and the cinematography was different, with much use of a fisheye lens. There are many funny moments in \"Poor Things,\" but...",
    "26": "Where to begin with this one....First off, the performances presented here are top of their class. Absolutely phenomenal! In a film with characters as strange as these, you need a strong cast and every player here was up to the task and more! Just brilliant!Secondly, the story is insane. I mean padded room, straight jacket type of insane. When reading the synopsis, I was thinking about how wild of a concept it was and did not think they could pull off such an audacious plot. However, Yorgos and company had a specific vision for this film and it shows in the amount of detail in both the screenplay and the visionary artistic decisions. I can say, they completely nailed it!Thirdly, exploring the human condition through sexuality, in all emotional forms, has been done before. Though, never quite like this. It was refreshing to see it through the eyes of someone reborn and ready for everything life had to throw her, as opposed to the usual timid youthful eyes.Lastly, the cinematography is wonderfully done. Mixing between black and white to full color, with wild scenery and beautifully detailed architecture. Sometimes the film felt like a dream captured within a painting. It was quite beautiful.Overall, I would highly recommend it. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea. It is very artsy, very sexually uncomfortable, and very strange. However, if you enjoy great storytelling and truly original visions on film, better see this on the big screen.4.5 surgerys out of 5.",
    "27": "As a big fan of Yorgos I was really hyped for this one, and let me tell you, it's not for everyone.The first two thirds of the movie are setup, and only the last one is the payoff, which is more in line with Yorgos' style.If you're accustomed to artsy films, you're gonna like the whole style of the production design, but otherwise it might seem kind of weird - the wide angle lens, the overexaggerated landscapes, the old timey, quirky dialogue lines and mannerisms.Also a good aspect is the fact that Emma Stone here, has maybe for the second time, left her own snarky personality aside, and completely immersed herself in the character - the director's job, well done.Otherwise the film is a recreation of the stages of development of the emancipated woman's psyche, and it's quite interesting in that metaphorical realm.The acting is good all the way, with highlights from Mark Ruffalo and the guy that plays the baddie, William Daffoe is amazing In everything he's in, but that's expected, and he's not the focus in this film either way.If I have to state my subjective opinion - whether you're able to withhold the want for instant gratification is gonna play a major role for whether you're gonna like this film, if you can hold for at least half the movie, at least you're gonna get involved with the characters and it might keep your interest, but if you're one which stays committed to watch something till the end, you're definitely not gonna regret it.If you're expecting something groundbreaking, like Yorgos' first three films, this is not the one.If you plan on watching this stoned, go ahead, it'll be magnificent.I gave it a score of 9, but if you're not inclined to give higher score to a film because of it's production value and technicality, you should take my score more like 7-8.",
    "28": "I am absolutely blown away by this film, and it breaks my heart I'll never again be able to experience it for the first time. \"Poor Things\" is the most original film in years, a cinematic masterpiece that dares to go boldly where few films venture. Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone deliver a hilarious yet very dark comedy that keeps you on the edge of your seat.Poor Things\" not only redefines the boundaries of storytelling but also showcases the brilliance of its cast and crew. The film's daring exploration of societal issues, coupled with its wicked sense of humor, elevates it to a level of cinematic excellence rarely seen. Every scene is a testament to the meticulous craftsmanship of Yorgos Lanthimos and the captivating performances of Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Mark Ruffalo. As a viewer, you'll find yourself laughing, contemplating, and marveling at the sheer audacity of this dark comedy. \"Poor Things\" isn't just a movie; it's an immersive experience that lingers in your thoughts, inviting you to reflect on its profound and thought-provoking themes. This cinematic gem is a triumph that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the standout films of its time.",
    "29": "Confused (for the first half hour or so), moved, charmed - that's how I can describe my emotions while watching 'Poor Things' by Yorgos Lanthimos. He's definitely a \"twisted mind,\" overindulging in the fisheye effect, but that doesn't detract from the film's brilliance.In short, Willem Dafoe is someone like Dr. Frankenstein, who even physically resembles the doctor's creation from the classic films. Here, he has created... Emma Stone - a beautiful woman with a baby's brain transplanted into her, and she's just starting to explore the world. The first part is quite dark, black and white, repellent, often resorting to the mentioned fisheye. Everything changes when the heroine awakens her sexual sensuality and begins to experience reality through it. Suddenly, the film becomes richly colorful and even funny. Throughout, it maintains its intelligent humor, shining in every scene, with the main focus being the questioning the postulates of the world surrounding the characters (something like the end of the 19th or early 20th century, but with many elements of steampunk) through the unburdened consciousness of a child in a woman's body.I generally have reservations about Lanthimos's aesthetics, often crossing certain boundaries. And it's present here, but in moderate doses, mainly in the beginning. But the fact that I was charmed by the film despite my reservations should speak even more. I believe it should win not only the Golden Lion from the Venice Film Festival but also any Golden Globes, Oscars, or whatever else is up to be grabbed this season. And Emma Stone, too. Definitely a 10/10 rating, which I don't give that often.",
    "30": "I have liked Emma Stone for a long time, since I saw her in \"Easy A\". I also loved her in \"Birdman\" and \"La la land\" and \"Cruella\".But now she has outdone herself with her astonishing performance in director Yorgos Lanthimos's new film, \"Poor Things\". He also directed the movie \"The Lobster\", which was an interesting film.But this film is brilliant. The actors are all excellent, including Willem Dafoe from \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", \"Mississippi Burning\" and \"Wild at Heart\". He has never been better and deserves to win the Oscar for best supporting actor in my opinion.Also excellent is Mark Ruffalo from \"The Kids are Alright\", \"Spotlight\" and \"Foxcatcher\". He gives one of his best performances.And Emma Stone definitely deserves the Oscar for best actress. If I had my way, this thing would win like twelve Oscars, including best picture! I loved it!",
    "31": "\"I have adventured it and found nothing but sugar and violence.\" Bella Baxter (Emma Stone)From Voltaire to Tim Burton and Frankenstein to Wes Anderson, Poor Things has just about all you could ask for in a fantastic fairy tale about a late nineteenth-century girl coming of age in a world she is determined won't be dominated by men. Throw in an Oscar-worthy lead performance by Emma Stone, and you will have a pseudo-bio to give Barbie and Nyad a serious run for Oscar and Golden Globes.Director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster) once again shows he's a tough competitor for the most imaginative film of the year. Without Time Burton, it's his year for the wildest story with challenging themes, gorgeous sets, and bizarre characters, none more strange than mad scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (who else but Willem Dafoe?). He has resurrected Bella (Emma Stone) with the brain of a child, who eventually roams the great cities of the world such as Paris and London looking for pleasure and growing incrementally in her understanding of human foibles, especially men's.She blithely takes a job as a sex worker, having learned about sexual pleasure and agency through louche cad Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo in another Oscar-worthy role). Her bildungsroman experiences, from which she learns how to navigate a corrupt society, leave her far and away from the poor creation of the crazed Dr. Baxter.From the expressionistic Baxter lab to the toy-like luxury liner, the set design is almost as sumptuous as Barbie's, and Bella's developing libertine persona is more colorful than even commercially-successful Barbie's. That Stone is the leading Oscar-worthy role of 2023 is obvious; that her character has much more to say about equality and Puritanism than any other film of that year will be manifest at the end of the Oscar 2024 ceremony.Duncan's attempt to reel in Bella's uncontrolled language by giving her only these three responses could as well describe Poor Things: \"How marvelous,\" \"Delighted,\" and \"How do they make the pastry so crisp?\"",
    "32": "I've recently watched many 'monster' movies ('Godzilla Minus One', 'Monster' by Hirokazu Koreeda, and 'Poor things'), and Emma Stone's unrestrained and explosive performance in 'Poor Things' presents a different possibility of Frankenstein's monster. Set in a finely crafted landscape and time, it subtly deconstructs the 'polite society' through adventures, experiments, and embodied exploration in societal slices, making it a feminist cult film. It's one of the best movies I've seen recently.Many people might compare it to 'Barbie', which, beneath its commercial veneer, offers shallow, didactic content and a direct satire of the present. However, 'Poor Things' delves deeper into dark fantasy and absurdity. In the end, it doesn't dissect and reconstruct patriarchy and privileged society, representing a return to reality in another sense.The movie also reminded me of 'Killers of the Flower Moon' and 'Babylon.' The former because I rewatched it yesterday and I, despite noticing more details from Scorsese's masterpiece, still maintain my initial view that it overly stereotypes women from a 'straight white male perspective,' fitting too realistically into the era. 'Poor Things,' however, perfectly balances this offset from 'Killers.' As for 'Babylon,' which I watched at the end of last year in the similar time, it's filled with bizarre physical and visual spectacles, but compared to 'Poor Things,' it's too full, too noisy, and tries too hard.",
    "33": "Greetings again from the darkness. Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos is possibly the most divisive director working today. Movie goers tend to either love his films like THE FAVOURITE (2018), THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017), THE LOBSTER (2015), and DOGTOOTH (2009) or walk away baffled that any decent human being could enjoy such dark works of strangeness and oddity. Despite this, two of his films have received Oscar nominations, and this latest may be both his most accessible and most outrageous project yet. It's also a rare outing where Lanthimos left the writing to others. His co-writer on THE FAVOURITE, Tony McNamara (\"The Great\") has adapted the screenplay from the 1992 novel by renowned Scottish writer Alasdair Gray, whose tome was influenced by Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\".Oscar winner Emma Stone delivers a truly remarkable (and physically demanding) performance as Bella Baxter. When we first meet Bella, she has the mind and coordination of a toddler in an adult woman's body ... the product of Dr. Godwin Baxter (you can call me God), played by Willem Dafoe. God is a surgeon-slash-mad scientist, his own scarred body the result of experiments conducted by his father. God is both doctor and monster. Although various animal blends (ducks, chickens, dogs, etc) roam the premises, it is Bella who is clearly God's most treasured production. Her reanimation process and backstory are spelled out in the movie.Bella develops daily, and when Godwin's lawyer, Duncan Wedderbum (Mark Ruffalo) shows up to take care of some business, he is intrigued by Bella and offers to take her on an adventure ... one that ultimately spans Lisbon to Paris, and a luxury cruise ship to a brothel. Duncan and Bella engage in \"furious jumping\" (her phrase for sex) and soon her libido is quite advanced, and her river of independence flows freely, turning Duncan into a whiny buffoon. This story, Bella's story, is really about a woman finding her own way in a world where men try to control/manager her. It's fascinating to see her hyper curiosity about the world and her surroundings. On top of that, Bella is often quite direct and unfiltered in her statements.The humor here is frequent and unconventional as evidenced by Bella being described as \"a beautiful retard\", and the stream of deadpan one-liners. Still, the message comes across loudly and clearly as we marvel at Bella and Emma Stone's performance. I hesitate to use the word fearless (unless it's Tom Cruise) since it's just acting, but the word applies to Ms. Stone here. Supporting work comes from Christopher Abbott, Margaret Qualley, Ramy Yussef, Jarrod Carmichael, Hannah Schygulla, and Kathryn Hunter, while Mark Ruffalo revels in flashing his comedic chops.Cinematographer Robbie Ryan interjects black and white for effect and makes good use of the fish-eye lens. Production Designers James Price and Shona Heath get creative with set pieces, especially the cruise ship and brothel, and Costume Designer Holly Waddington nearly steals the spotlight with Bella's outfits, which are always a bit exaggerated. The music adds a specific element and works quite well, and there is a truly awesome dance scene. Yorgos Lanthimos again earns the title Master of Strangeness with this outlandish film with bits from Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Young Frankenstein (a common thread). The film is somehow both extremely funny and severely disturbing, and is an example of good people trying to come to grips with the realization that people often do bad things. My only complaint is the film features what are possibly the worst closing credits ever.Opening in theaters on December 8, 2023.",
    "34": "I've watched three other movies by Lanthimos (The Favorite, The Lobster, Killing of a Sacred Deer) and was especially excited for this one. While the acting is great (special mention to Emma Stone), the story and the way it was carried out was not so great.Nearly half of the movie was filled with unnecessary nudity and sex scenes that were painful and uncomfortable to watch as a young woman. Men were the only people laughing and being amused by those scenes in the theatre (I wonder why) while half of the women looked as uncomfortable as me and my partner. I'm sure having Emma Stone naked throughout the movie (no matter how forced it looks) will encourage many people to buy a ticket so kudos to you Lanthimos!Despite the male-gazyness of the movie, it does have some funny lines and clever dialogues here and there, and the sets and style were amazing. However, the story failed to get deep and deliver a meaningful message despite many attempts to do so, and in the end left me extremely dissatisfied.",
    "35": "I mean, what a beautiful piece of moving art to look at. The set design. Cinematography. The costumes. Each & every shot. Yargos is truly a one-of-a-kind director. I want to live in the world he's created, each & every masterful brushstroke created is just so beautiful. The performances are excellent, and yes, Emma Stone is truly magnificent. I know I am quite outnumbered by not giving this movie a 10/10 or a Best Of review... but...I simply cannot get over one thing.Yes, it's the age issue. Just how old is she mentally when she is getting mercilessly boinked every other scene? Are we to believe 5? 10? 12? It just made me cringe. I couldn't get past it. I wasn't expecting this reaction of my own... everyone else seems to be fine & not think twice about it, but I'm sitting here, like, really, what in the Lolita hell is this? That's where it left me. It put me in such an uneasy spot that I count my get over it. That was just my experience? Otherwise? A stunning film, sure. But at its core? And am I to believe Yargos really has such a great grasp on feminism? I don't think so either. It's clearly from a man's perspective & desire.",
    "36": "I was lucky enough to see this incredible film at this year's LFF (to which the audience reacted with almost constant laughter). Straight away, you're sucked into its strange, steampunk Victorian world thanks to incredible directing/production design/cinematography/performances/score.Even with its many quirks, the film remains grounded by a somewhat conventional story (as far as Lanthimos is concerned) which gives it the unique feel of both an old epic and something very new.The incredible acting and dialogue are what make you buy into this crazy world - with career best performances by Emma Stone AND Mark Ruffalo (and Willem Dafoe - which goes without saying).Can't wait to see this one again, if you love good storytelling (and aren't put off by quirky dialogue and stylised shots), you will love this!",
    "37": "I was fortunate to see this film before its premiere. This movie offers an interesting way to tell the story of growing up and discovering how the world works and leaves its mark. The strong cast also contributes to a more descriptive portrayal of the types of people who can appear in your life's journey. The dramatic experience can captivate you from start to finish.After the movie ends, you'll find yourself pondering how the story would have unfolded if the characters' appearances were in a different order. Nevertheless, the movie may seem a bit strange in the first half-hour as you try to explore what it's all about. The beginning of this film appears somewhat similar to \"Flowers for Algernon,\" albeit in a more vulgar way, but it still evokes strong similarities.I also admired Emma Stone's costumes. The humor in the movie is quite debatable; there are genuinely funny jokes and moments, but if you delve deeper, it can take on a darker tone. Nonetheless, it's very enjoyable, and you might find it satisfying.In conclusion, for my very first review, I can confidently say that it's truly worth seeing. It will provoke a range of controversial thoughts and feelings due to its polarizing scenes. I rated it a 9 only because I'm not a big fan of explicit scenes on the big screen, and you should also be prepared for a significant number of erotic moments in the film.",
    "38": "Nothing like a movie that does what cinema is supposed to do, give you a story as visual as it is audible. It was fun just looking at the style of this film.The story in itself was quite amazing. What seems like a strange take on Frankenstein with Willima Defoe perfectly playing the role of the doctor.Emma Stone was fantastic in this lead role; she seemed to go all in and all out to make this character breathe.Last but not least Mark Rufflo just showcases what a great actor he is.It's not a coincidence this film came out in December. It is going for that gold, and I would not be surprised if it won everything it went up for.Deserves it.",
    "39": "When the circumstances of our lives don't suit us, it's time to reinvent ourselves - something that happens both literally and metaphorically in this latest offering from director Yorgos Lanthimos. But the way that result comes about here represents a truly inspired fusion of genres, including comedy, romance, social commentary and sci-fi, making for one of the most inventive, unusual and hilarious releases of recent years. This offbeat feminist fable tells the story of how a pregnant, young, anonymous suicide victim (Emma Stone) is reanimated with the aid of a brain transplant from her unborn fetus, an achievement accomplished by a colorful, controversial but well-meaning surgeon/scientist a la Dr. Frankenstein (Willem Dafoe). He nurtures his subject back to life, health and sentience, a sometimes-challenging process that finally surfaces when she discovers sexuality, the trigger for exploring a new, independent life for herself, both physically and emotionally. Through a series of adventures over the course of a trip through Europe with a free-wheeling, lusty but lecherous, self-serving lawyer (Mark Ruffalo), she finds herself as a self-actualized woman in an age where that's more of a rarity than a standard, particularly in a world where men treat women more like property than people. While the film's pacing could use some shoring up in the middle, this offering nevertheless entertains with uproarious laughs throughout, even when the narrative turns more thoughtful and substantive. The superb performances by Stone, Dafoe and Ruffalo are top shelf, contributing to the picture's whopping 13 Critics Choice Award and 7 Golden Globe Award nominations. The film is also visually stunning in its cinematography and editing, as well as in its spectacular and whimsical production design, filled with images reminiscent of the movies of Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam while sustaining a look all its own. Admittedly, this release features a good deal of explicit sexuality, both visually and in the dialogue, so sensitive viewers should take note. However, as one of the most anticipated pictures of this year's awards season, \"Poor Things\" never disappoints, serving up a solid offering that consistently tickles the funny bone while giving audiences much to think about - and there's nothing poor in any of that.",
    "40": "Poor Things is a visually stunning and intellectually stimulating film, offering a unique blend of dark humor, social commentary, and gothic romance. Director Yorgos Lanthimos, known for his bizarre and unsettling films like The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, delivers another distinctive and thought-provoking work.Emma Stone shines as Bella Baxter, portraying her transformation from a naive child to a defiant woman with captivating charm and depth. The supporting cast is equally impressive, with Mark Ruffalo delivering a memorable performance as the eccentric scientist and Olivia Colman adding her usual comedic flair.The film's visuals are captivating, featuring meticulously crafted sets and costumes that evoke the Victorian era with a touch of the surreal. The use of color, lighting, and cinematography is masterful, creating a visually stunning and immersive world for the characters to inhabit.Lanthimos' signature dark humor is present throughout the film, often used to satirize societal norms and challenge traditional gender roles. While some may find the humor unsettling or uncomfortable, it effectively complements the film's themes and adds a layer of complexity to the narrative.The film's central themes of identity, societal expectations, and female empowerment are explored through Bella's journey of self-discovery. As she encounters prejudice and discrimination, she learns to challenge the status quo and forge her own path. While the message may be delivered with a heavy dose of Lanthimos' signature absurdity, it resonates deeply and leaves a lasting impression.However, the film is not without its flaws. The narrative can feel uneven at times, with some scenes dragging on and others feeling rushed. Additionally, the film's ending may leave some viewers feeling unsatisfied or confused.Overall, Poor Things is a compelling and challenging film that pushes the boundaries of traditional filmmaking. It is not a film for everyone, as its dark humor and bizarre elements may be off-putting to some viewers. However, for those who appreciate Lanthimos' unique style and are willing to engage with its complex themes, Poor Things is a rewarding experience offering a stimulating and unforgettable cinematic journey.",
    "41": "Anyone who is familiar with Yorgos Lanthimos's style of filmmaking knows better than to expect something low-key or non-descript from him. Win, lose or draw, he always goes out with the weirdest bang a director can come up with. This might be his most extreme film to date, but still not for all tastes. For those who love his work, be prepared to be giddy.A young woman whose brain has been replaced by that of her child finds herself in the stately house of a renowned brain surgeon whom she regards as a father figure. But as her mind rapidly develops and catches up with her age, she starts to realize what she's been missing. She chances to meet a reprobate older man who handles the doctor's legal affairs. But as she grows, her bond with the doctor never truly dies even if he initially kept her cloistered. Lanthimos evidently views the scientific community as giving women a route to overcoming entrenched patriarchy.Emma Stone gives another electric performance as the female version of Frankenstein's monster whose burgeoning development overcomes the shackles she lives with under her caring but ancient father figure. Mark Ruffalo and Willem Dafeo are also a joy to watch. Although the film's length becomes noticeable at one or two points, it's still a superb job by Lanthimos. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys audacious and layered storytelling.",

    "43": "Visually stunning, 'Poor Things' mirrors Tim Burton and Dr. Seuss with its landscapes, sceneries, themes, and eccentric characters.Bella learns and explores a new world, defying her comfort zone along the way. Her uncivilized behavior discussing others sexual habits, threatening to punch babies, and encouraging any child like behavior from others was amusing and also beautiful to watch as people gravitated towards her openness and honesty.Before anything 'Poor Things' is outrageously funny and doesn't overshadow its poignant message of female empowerment and personal freedoms. It's a perfect balance between humor and meaningful themes.With its masterful storytelling, it's an easy front runner for the year's best. All around great performances from the cast with Emma Stone being the obvious standout performance.",

    "45": "I went into this film relatively blind other than having seen the trailer. Right from the trailer you know you're in for a chaotic yet stunningly beautiful journey.The acting performances were top-notch. Emma Stone blew it out of the park and convincingly portrayed a very unique and quirky character. William Dafoe is not a stranger to weird characters, and his performances are equally natural and convincing. Mark Ruffalo was absolutely hysterical here.The set designs are amazing. It's magical, it's delightful, and it flawlessly accentuates the perception of our main character. When she visits a new place, there is beauty and novelty in everything she sees, and we, the audience, gets to experience that with her. The soundtrack equally accentuates the film as a whole with its bizarre notes and wondrous themes.There is also quite a bit of dark humor that, again, like the set designs, the quirky characters, and the odd music notes, help shape the beautiful world these Poor Things live in.I enjoyed the character progression of the main character. We get to observe innocence, curiosity, hedonism, and a natural progression toward meaningful purpose. It is important to note there are quite a lot of scenes involving pleasure, but it is driving home a point about sexuality that you might agree or disagree with.The plot progression definitely relied on a handful of convenient events, but I don't find them to be critical flaws for the film. I believe the message inherent in our main character's journey is a thoughtful one. There is a celebration to curiosity, to experiencing new things, and to constantly challenge your own views. I think it is very easy to lose that curiosity as an adult but it is an important lifelong quality to maintain.With such an absurd yet fantastical premise, the film adapted its source material extremely well and is sure to be one of the most memorable films of the decade.",
    "46": "Yorgos Lanthimos once again presents us with an excerpt from a distorted fantasy world, which, however, has more parallels with ours than one would initially expect. The story is focused on Bella, who was brought back to life after death by a peculiar scientist, after which she learns about the world with the brain of a child and gradually develops in all directions, even those that could be described as taboo. Emma Stone gives a masterful acting performance and her character adds more and more layers as the minutes of the film go by until the triumphant finale.Transforming from Bella the toddler into a socially conscious woman, she surpasses all her previous roles. Whether it's her walk, thoughts, facial expressions, or body games, she leaves us in no doubt as to what mental stage she's currently in, and with Mark Ruffalo seconding her, there's no shortage of bizarre moments.Intelligent dialogues, thoughtful concept, topical theme, visually intoxicating images, captivating performances, devilishly morbid ideas, lots of nudity, art film, Oscar nominations are inevitable.",
    "47": "The movie Poor Things directed by Yorgos Lanthimos ( who also directed The Favourite) is about man and a woman relationship and expectancy of purity and oneness of a lover or would be spouse . Emma Stone plays the role of Bella Baxter , a young ,soft and beautiful female with brain damage and post surgery now with brain of a baby . Bella is now product of work done by a very intelligent and innovative surgeon Dr Godwin Baxter ( William Dafoe great in The Florida Project, At Eternity's Gate). Bella is learning social mannerisms along with being independent under the guidance of Dr Baxter and his male student Max (actor Ramy Youssef) . Dr Baxter encourages Max to marry Bella and legal papers are drawn with help of Duncan Wedderburn ( Mark Ruffalo in another great role). Duncan finds it fascinating in making a legal document for someone and his curiosity is tied up with fascination when he sees pretty Bella who is now experimenting with self love for her own body and enjoys Duncan's touches. Duncan and Bella leave together to explore the world and Bella convinces Dr Baxter and her would be husband Max that she has to explore the world and relationship with Duncan before becoming Max's wife. Bella enters the world of sex and longing of Duncan and wonders why people don't have sex all the time when sex gives so much pleasure. Duncan enjoys Bella's company and realizes he loves Bella. The scene when Duncan sees marks on inner thighs of Bella is priceless. Bella is free spirited and an explorer. Mark Ruffalo did a great job at acting as nonchalant male interested in having Bella as a sexual partner and then moving to emotional attachment and wanting to be sole sexual partner of Bella. Emma Stone is truly a gifted actress and has great facial expressions even with remarks like \" don't think that is going to happen now\" after she tells Duncan she wants to have sex after he finds out she had sex with some other person. Innocence, sense of accomplishment , relief, pure joy, childishness , tantrums all very well exhibited by Emma Stone and shows mastering of range of emotional display with ease. 2hrs 21 minutes could be edited. Oscar worthy acting by Emma Stone. Mark Ruffalo did a great job. Good Direction.",
    "48": "Dall-e Keywords: Art House, Autism, Folklore Avant-garde, Socialism, Mid Century Modern, Dark Comedy, Fashion, Cartoon Network Flapjack, Feminism, Colorful caricature.People clapped when it finished. Cool. Nearly all aspects of the film were truly flawless, except for 'the point of it all', the mission, the message, the lesson, etc. Someone unaware of modern Hollywood and Margot Robbie's affiliations might be confused when looking for it in this film about ethics and XXX. This is where a lot of gaps in the story happen and one is left to wonder \"Why\" very often. The film was written around 'The Mission', instead of the other way around.Because AI might as well had written it (with minor human involvement), it's a bit scrambled, so try to follow... A XXX woman is an empowered and enlightened being free from the cage of God and man. God is man, good and evil. Aggressive dominant male is weak, exchanged for (demands) even weaker Passive submissive cucked into infinity, emasculates hyper aggressive male by turning him into the animal he is, and restores balance with polyamorous fem-lesbian (femme) in protest. Man is the servant of women. Children and problems are as synonymous as heaven & hell. Feminism is freedom of self, and socialism is freedom from God and man.*Bell rings*Sally: Excuse me, teacher? Is it not true that sexual liberty cannot exist without men to exercise it?Teacher: And?Sally: Well, how does opening our legs like we open our minds put us in a position of power? Shouldn't we be giving men less of what they want if we are to be masters over them?Teacher: What you're referring to is what men have been trying to sell for millennia. Do not forget that 'The Mission' includes domesticating the male to eliminate the need for such conservative acts. XXX is where a woman's power lies, the liberation of it is as much an exercise for women, than it is for men. We are in control of the powers they try to take away from us.Sally: yes, but we're taught that money is a system that men made to control us also, so shouldn't we reject prostitution as it's the most a woman can do to serve men in all capacity? Shouldn't they be serving us without it?Teacher: They already do that naturally darling, this is about risking nothing in the process.It wasn't the questions that sent poor little Sally to detention that day, but that she questioned anything at all. The only valid question Sally could've asked is \"What can I do to support The Mission?\" which is more an affirmation, but still; all she should've said that day.5/10."
