    "0": "The Zone of Interest, the latest film by Jonathan Glazer, is a harrowing and disturbing drama that explores the lives of the Nazi commandant of Auschwitz, Rudolf Höss, and his wife Hedwig, who live in a house and garden next to the camp. Based on the novel by Martin Amis, the film is a loose adaptation that uses the real names and testimonies of the people involved in the events, rather than fictionalizing them.The film is a masterful exercise in contrast and tension, as it juxtaposes the mundane and domestic scenes of the Höss family with the horrific and unspeakable atrocities happening just over the wall. Glazer avoids showing graphic violence, but instead uses sound, suggestion and implication to create a sense of dread and horror. The film also challenges the audience to confront the banality and complicity of evil, as it shows how the Hösses rationalize, justify and normalize their actions and roles in the genocide.The film features stunning performances by Sandra Hüller and Christian Friedel as Hedwig and Rudolf Höss, who portray their characters with nuance and complexity. Hüller is especially remarkable as Hedwig, who oscillates between denial, curiosity, guilt and defiance as she grapples with her situation. The film also boasts a remarkable cinematography by Lukasz Zal, who captures the bleak and oppressive atmosphere of Auschwitz with stark and haunting images. The film's score by Mica Levi is equally haunting and unsettling, creating a mood of anxiety and despair.The Zone of Interest is not an easy film to watch, but it is a powerful and important one. It is a film that does not shy away from confronting the darkest aspects of human nature, but also does not exploit or sensationalize them. It is a film that asks difficult questions, but does not offer easy answers. It is a film that will stay with you long after it ends.",
    "1": "An absolutely mesmerizing piece of art that challenges and provokes the audience, while also depicting a morbid yet enticingly original perspective on the most infamous and horrific tragedy of all time. Johnathon Glazer's Zone of Interest is not a film to merely watch, but rather one to be absorbed. A paradoxical film, where the most important and powerful images are the ones we never get to see.The concept of the withholding of art being the overarching meaning behind the work certainly isn't reinventing the wheel, but Glazer's presentation and execution puts a spin on the concept in such a unique and cryptic way, it will have you asking yourself if such an idea can ever be done in cinema again.The \"withholding\" begins with the opening of the film. Before the title is flashed onto screen, the audience is treated to a 3-minute synthetic overture in total darkness. A choice that will have you wondering if the projectionist forgot to take off the camera lid. While from a distance it may come across as a mundane or pretentious decision from an amateur director, Glazer is already subjecting the audience to the ethos of his film. The focus is on what we don't see.As Mica Levi's haunting, Aphex Twin remiscent score comes to a close, we are treated to the first image of the film, the Höss family. And for the next 2 hours, we are treated to only images of the Höss family. Never once do we as an audience get to actually witness the horrors of what lies beyond the concentration camp walls. However, that does not mean we are spared.Throughout the film, we feel the effects of the Holocaust without ever truly seeing it. Whether it be the blood-orange glow of the burnt Jewish bodies from the Auschwitz chimney being cast through the window pane of Hedwig Höss' (Sandra Huëller) upstairs guest room. The dichotomy of the Hoss children's playful laughs paired against the sorrowful howls of the tortured souls of the next door death camp. Or the dust remains of decayed Jewish skeletons dumped into the nearby river, ruining Rudolph Höss' (Christian Friedel) canoe adventure with his children. Suffering is felt at every corner of this film. Glazer masterfully crops out the harsh images of the Holocaust, but keeps them just close enough so their presence is still unavoidable. A feeling of historical tragedy that still rings true today.The film is a slow-burn, to say the least. There's never truly an inciting incident, an overly graphic scene of violence, or even really a definitive plot.Yet that is where the art of this film lies, in its subtlety.By introducing images and story-lines that are never fully realized, finished, or even acknowledged, Glazer keeps the audience on its toes by providing only a short glimpse into this family's life, all paired against the gargantuan looming walls of Auschwitz. We see young romance, joust between siblings, and family values, all without ever really learning anything about the family. We are never directly given names, ages, what their hobbies or interests are. Only minute glances at what middle-upper class German family life in the 40s would be ... next to a death camp of course.Oh yeah, the Höss family's idyllic suburban home with 6 rooms and a garden that rivals that of Francis Hodgson Burnett's, is built directly next to the infamous Auschwitz death camp. A property line that excites the family, Rudolph in particular.Rudolph, or Rudy as his wife likes to call him, is the patriarch of the family. A high-ranking officer for the Third Reich, he is one of the head guards at Auschwitz. He is a cold-blooded methodical man, who focuses on efficiency, and has a true love for his work. His wife on the other hand, Hedwig, is a high-ranking officer in an of herself. She runs the Höss family establishment, caring for 5 rambunctious children, enlisting the help of local girls for household duties, and doing whatever necessary to achieve the dream life she had ever since she was a girl, a big house and family.This description of a traditional working man, a traditional wife and their traditional family doesn't sound like much to chew on, but with the next door screams of the innocent reminding the audience who this family is, the film could not feel more tense. To portray a family of Nazis as just your average boring family, reminiscent of an American family in the 50s, is daring, to say the least. But this is exactly Glazer's intention, to bring a perspective on tragedy we have never seen before. One that, from a distance, doesn't seem harmful. But on a closer inspection, finding that the distance is the harm.Glazer however, doesn't only ever submit the audience to monotonous montages of basic family life, though it is prevalent. He instead uses the effect of monotony to then surprise his audience with choices an ideas that would never be seen in a period piece. Every so often, the film will deliver a cryptic sequence or audio effect that is a complete betrayal of the historical drama formula. The first, and most reoccurring of which, being an inverted color, night vision setting on the camera. Without warning, the film will switch to this bizarre camera setting, breaking away from the established world of the film. This subversion adds to the artistic and innovative vision of Glazer, while also avoiding gimmick.The film also has an incredible use of sound design, straying away from historical drama cliches. Rather than including songs or sounds from the 40s, Glazer utilizes the work of sound designer Johnnie Burns to craft a heavy and electronic approach that adds an incredible depth to the film. The sound bellows throughout the theatre and shakes you to your very core. This choice proves to be another masterful decision by Glazer, as it amplifies an undeniable sense of impending doom and scale that no other design could depict.The Zone of Interest is one of the most intrinsically haunting pieces of art I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. Its performances, originality, and lead by Johnathon Glazer undeniably makes it the best from Cannes, and one of the best films I've seen in the past decade, if not the best. Its subtlety, unique perspective, and daring choices creates a breathtaking atmosphere and movie-going experience. It's as impressive as a film can get, and represents a true understanding and mastering of cinema as an art form.10 out of 10.",
    "2": "Caught this at the LFF. As a student of Judaism, the theme of the Holocaust passionates me, and the premise of the film seemed brilliant, and I was really looking forward to it. I started to have a slight suspicion when we were treated to five minutes of a black screen with ominous music just after the opening credits.To be fair, the film does have some amazing ideas; all four of them would have made a wonderful, thought-provoking twenty minute short. As a feature film, they are not enough. After the first agonising hour, you just want to scream at the filmmaker: you're no Chantal Akerman, no point in trying, just fly lower and put some graft into it. I was seriously tempted to leave before the end, but I kept hoping against all hope; in truth, the fourth and final idea does land in the penultimate sequence, but you still leave with the impression that this should have been a great film, and yet somehow it ends up being a shallow bore.",
    "3": "Watched this at its premiere in Cannes without any expectations whatsoever. The premise looks interesting: the head of Auschwitz lives a very paradoxically normal life with his family just behind the wall that separates them from the camp. So normal that it's filled with endless scenes of them eating, brushing their teeth, kids playing, parents reading, even sleeping while nothing else happens. Just as exciting as life in the 40's. And... that's it ! Once in a while, you can barely hear an execution or a scream on the other side of the wall while the family hardly notices at all. What is happening then is left to the viewer's imagination. Throw in some experimental, ominous and unfitting electronic music and occasional uninspired video art gimmicks and you've got a movie. There were enough ideas for a 5mn short film but it looks like the director tried his hardest to extend it into a full-length feature by all means. That was definitely not necessary. He even seemed to notice something else HAD to happen so he found something to spike this giant snoozefest a little bit: Will the husband accept to be mutated somewhere else with a higher rank ? His wife doesn't want him to, she's happy with her family life, while he's hesitant and hopes to convince the kommandantur that he can stay where they are. Big suspense. Not. Because nobody cares.This is not a difficult film to watch because of its supposed tension (there is hardly any despite all the efforts - just go spend a weekend in the German or Austrian countryside and you'll feel just the same) but because it's unbelievably boring, uneventful and empty with shockingly stale dialogue (when there is any). Glazer is no Hitchcock, Bergman or Argento. The raving reviews can only come from people who will praise anything related to the horrors of the Holocaust. This film has nothing.",
    "4": "This is an exceptionally disappointing film, misleading historically and dramatically empty, with a boring screenplay. It wants to make a point about the proximity of Rudolf Hoss's house to the suffering victims of Nazism, but it gives no proper impression of the geography of the Auschwitz complex. Thus we see the tops of the well built Austrian army barracks that was Auschwitz I, but nothing at all of Birkenau, a mile away, where the worst horrors unfolded. It also matters exactly what month and year we are in (it seems to begin in summer 43) and this is not made clear to the audience, many of who will now know that Auschwitz was first an agricultural research station, then a camp (Auschwitz I) for Polish political prisoners and then part of the holocaust from June 1942. On Hoss himself, whose autobiography is devoid of all human feeling, the film quite disgracefully shows him throwing up at the prospect of being responsible for the arrival of 700,000 Hungarian Jews, as though he cared about that at all. For the rest, the scenes are nicely shot but lacking in cinematic or dramatic interest.",
    "5": "Presumably those who made this thought they were being subtle but all they have done is produce more holocaust porn. First, they get the geography of the Auschwitiz complex all wrong. Yes Hoss's house was very close to Auschwitz I but the real horrors in 1943 were happening at Birkenau a mile away. In any case showing the top half of the very well built austrian army barracks that was Auschwitz I all the time makes it seem like aregular prison. The train sounds in the backrgound are not those of a train slowing down. Hoss is presented at the end as a man with a conscience, throwing up at the prosoect of killing 700,000 hungarians. He had no conscience at all. At the end, comically, the auschwitz exhibition of jews' suitcases is juxtaposed with photos of Polish political prisoners with no explanation that the suitcases are not theirs.Above all the film is just boring, like Christian Petzold gone wrong.",
    "6": "Just when you thought A24 couldn't come out with more totally derivative garbage... they go and outdo themselves!Stylistically, the movie is extremely forceful. If you think \"The Zone of Interest\" is \"subtle\", in any way, you might as well not notice repeatedly getting hit over the head with a hammer.Considering the catalogue of movies that A24 has come out with in recent years this just makes the nth addition in a long line of identical movies... which really makes me wonder what they are paying the directors for exactly?This is Marvel for people that think they are above Marvel but fall for the same exact formulaic garbage.",
    "7": "This incandescent film portrays the idyllic life that the family of Nazi commandant Rudolf Hoss enjoyed in a sumptuous house right next to the concentration camp in Auschwitz right in the middle of the Holocaust. There is very little soundtrack and it all unfolds at a deliberate pace that is in keeping with Jonathan Glazer's slow-burn, disquieting style. A rigorous sense of order and calm is prevalent throughout.We never actually see any of the Holocaust taking place even though it's right next door. The barbarism and butchery are only apparent from the screams in the distance or from fires at night or smoke during the daytime. The pristine, lush surroundings of this family bely the mass extermination that is taking place in the immediate vicinity. It's a masterful work in which conveys horrible events by leaving them to the imagination.A repeat viewing might be helpful as subtitles in this film are sometimes rapid-fire. But overall, this is an extraordinary and memorable film from start to finish. Recommended to everyone, without exception.",
    "8": "Christian Friedel is quite effective in his portrayal of the Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss here. He and wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) offer us one of the most stark contradictions I think I've ever seen on screen. The beautifully manicured garden of a delightful family home with an unique next door neighbour. That would be the Auschwitz concentration camp of which he was in control. We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs. It's not an history lesson - there are corners cut and licence is certainly taken with some of the timelines, but it's still a poignant look at human behaviour that's well worth a watch.",
    "9": "Whoever came up with the premise for this film is truly a filmmaking genius.Unlike any other Holocaust film, The Zone of Interest doesn't showcase virtually any of the hardships that take place inside the concentration camps. On the contrary, it casually pans over the daily life of a Nazi household, which, for certain of its members, is nothing short of heavenly despite being located just outside Auswitz's concentration camp. Instead of executions and gas chambers, the viewer is greeted with Sunday family excursions, pool parties and nonchalant discussions over garden grooming. Take away the Nazi attire and the camp's fernace, always so cleverly glooming in the background, and the film could literally be about any other mundane family. It is that mere irony and contradiction that set the tone for the whole film, which ultimately relies on the viewers' empathy and previous knowledge of the horrors of the Holocaust, without actually having to delve into any of them itself.To be clear, this is not a watch for casual moviegoers who opt for a war movie with powerful dialogue. The camera work is excellent, the acting is on point, albeit rather subtle, yet the narration plays out more so as an observational documentary with, admittedly, slow pacing and a lack of considerable climactic events.",
    "10": "Yes it's very very boring, nothing happens the first 45 minutes. Just mundane everyday things in the life of Nazi Germans. The only tension came when we thought they might have to move. This movie is living proof that tension is what makes a strong story and keeps audiences engaged. I actually fell asleep for the last 2/4 of the movie. I did wake up when it randomly transitioned to the present day and was confused at first but thought that was one of the stronger parts of the film. I gave it 7 stars because of the earnest effort, the acting (which was boring, but real), and cinematography and locations which were all beautiful. You can't deny it's beautifully shot, but it is literally so boring. I get what the director was going for, attempting to show us how ordinary people can be evil and they are still like everyday people in many ways. But it couldn't hold my engagement. It's definitely an artistic piece and a one time watch. This is a film I'd compare to watching paint dry. I also, didn't know Auschwitz looked like Italian villas? I should research this more, but the buildings were all so much prettier than I've seen in historical photos."
