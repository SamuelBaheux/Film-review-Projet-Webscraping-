    "0": "\"Silent Night\" is the new action revenge thriller from Hong Kong action legend, John Woo. At 77 years old, he hasn't lost touch with the genre and delivers his style of operatic kinetic action sequences that don't displease. However, the action sequences and Joel Kinnaman's performance is the only thing good about the movie. Predictable is one thing, but the movie is the same action movie we have seen before with a revenge aspect.Set at Christmas time, Brian (Joel Kinnaman,) and his wife Saya (Catalina Sandino Moreno,) lose their only son to a stray bullet after two rival gangs shoot from cars at each other in their neighbourhood. Brian chases them down, and he's shot in the throat. The title, \"Silent Night,\" Is because it's a silent movie with almost no dialogue, and that is where the film's biggest problems lie. Brian not speaking adds something different to the film as he uses facial expressions to convey feelings or the situations he finds himself in.Brian chases the gang members down and he is shot in the throat by Playa (Harold Torres,) a typical gang member with tattoos on his face. He shoots Brian, who recovers in the hospital, losing his ability to speak and discovering that his son has died. When he returns home, he hits the bottle and becomes engrained with revenge. He marks on the calendar the day he is going after the gang members while his wife watches him drink like a fish and lose himself, not knowing what to do or how to help him.Nobody speaks a word in the film. The only dialogue is from radio transmissions from Police chatter and that's it. Characters get punched, struck by a car or they scream when they are shot. There are some scenes of text between Brian and his wife but this doesn't further the plot because we know what kind of movie this is. A means to an end. There is an emotional story here but everyone is useless along with the gang who are going to get violently blown away by running right into the bullets.Brian is so filled with revenge. Joel Kinneman plays this well. Method acting in the mirror trying to scream, and you see the rage. He armours his car, learns to use a knife and becomes efficient at using handguns. He plans a date on the calendar when he is going after them. In the meantime, he becomes cold towards his wife, conducts surveillance on the gang leader responsible and hands the case to a cop, Detective Vassal (Kid Cudi) who is useless because his silence takes away from the idea that Brian was shot in the throat and can't talk but this guy can talk. How his character unfolds is one of the dumbest aspects of the movie.In the second act of the movie, I figured out the ending, and I was correct. You know that moment where it just clicks because you have seen it before, and where can the story go after this? There is no second story for a character like this.Brian sinks deeper into mania until one year passes, and he loads up every gun he has and puts on a bulletproof vest. His plan is to kill them all and he executes it almost flawlessly. But when you see Playa and his dumb girlfriend, he keeps on heroin, dancing, it just drags because it's all sound and noise. Saya sees she can't help anymore and the tight close-ups of her tears there make you feel for their situation. It is heartbreaking to see but when Brian is about to become a one-man army, how are we supposed to feel when he is simply another vigilante?First, he uses a car to spin around the thugs and shoots them all, al la \"John Wick,\" and then he appears on a motorcycle and shoots his way inside. Playa sends more of his goons after him and the idea of the grieving father is here, but because we don't hear anything from anyone, it's hard to convince feelings towards the characters, especially the dumb cop. He blasts his way through Playa's Batman-like skyscraper leading to the staircase sequence and eventually to Playa.\"Silent Night\" has great action sequences, but we have seen this before. Joel Kinneman is great, and the story is tragic and violent, but at the heart of it is vengeance which is used as an excuse for bullets to fly and cars to crash in glorious fashion. There is an emotional message about fatherhood here, and when tragedy strikes, what do you do? \"Death Sentence\" by Kevin Bacon conveyed this message much better, and I thought a lot about it while watching this movie because it's very similar right down to the story, but that was a better movie.5/10.",
    "1": "SILENT NIGHT (2023) ** Joel Kinnaman, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Kid Cudi. John Woo's disappointing action revenge flick with Kinnaman seeking vengeance on gangbangers who accidentally killed his son on Christmas has so much potential but is squandered in its hole-laden script by Robert Archer Lynn (i.e. Namely the sadly misused talent of Sandino Moreno as the spouse who basically just passively cries while her husband for months on end is holed up in their basement preparing for war). While Kinnaman's character is literally silenced due to his being shot in the throat renders him mute and his impressive implosive performance can't make up for the pedestrian trope-laden story (i.e. The police not doing their job). A few decent set pieces sadly cannot make up for a half-baked update on DEATH WISH and its ilk.",
    "2": "The idea of having NOBODY speak in the film except on a radio and a couple of mumbled words must have got someone excited in the pitch meeting. The reality is that it's awful. Just awful. The film is only 1hr 40 mins but it's still 40 mins too long!!!!! The whole middle can be cut out. Utterly pointless!! The action!!! Woo may have directed but the action scenes were devised by a 4 year old!!! In the car chase, despite the engines revving to the extreme, they are moving about 5 miles an hour!!!! The shoot outs see the bad guys about 10 feet from each other and nobody can hit a thing!!!!! Two cars driving side by side shooting at each other with about 200 bullets and they hit nothing!!!!!!!! I found myself laughing out loud and swearing profusely at the screen!!!! Woo's use of slo mo is still there but it just made scenes funnier!! The opening shows our main character running in slo mo and it looks awful as he is clearly pretending to run!!!!!!! CGI blood splatter galore! Don't bother!",
    "3": "I'm not sure if the reviewers watched the same movie as me. I found this film packed with cool stunts and action sequences. I got both John Wick and The Raid vibes while watching it. Some scenes even reminded me of something out of GTA V.Even though there wasn't much plot in the movie and no dialogues whatsoever, I think the film is carried forward by Joel Kinnaman's excellent acting. Not many big action stars could pull off the same.All in all, I found it an entertaining and excellent action film. Just switch of your brain and enjoy it. I'm probably going to watch it again. I'll rate it 8/10.",
    "4": "I hate to say, I'm overall disappointed. I really wanted to enjoy this but it fell flat for me. I figured John Woo going back to straight up action will be a treat. Instead of using the idea of a dialogueless action flick as an interesting device he creates a very drab story that is less than appealing. He makes little effort in trying interesting ways to propel the story within the confines he set up. It's like he never watched a silent movie and saw how you can tell a compelling story with minimal dialogue. He just leans on lame cliches. Also there's too many logocal errors, even for an action movie. And Joel Kinnaman, who I normally like, makes a less than appealing protagonist. Even without speaking his character seems annoying. An unfortunate misfire from something that had a lot of potential.",
    "5": "This is not up to John Woo's talent. I found the material entirely like a one-trick pony. All rage, and sadness, verging on insanity, without any real character development, or pathos. There is nothing in the lead character's story that allows the audience to sympathize with him, other than the loss of his son. There are no positive events to draw us into the story. Instead, we are faced with an ever-increasing level of horror, rage, and madness. Woo has been known to give violence an almost ballet type of choreography (Bullet time slow motion) but that is not what we are seeing here. With the rage of the main character, we are faced with depression, rage, and madness which causes an ever-increasing degree of violence that continues to the very end of the film. This film should have ratings of extreme violence attached. While I watched the entire film I was left with a deep feeling of disatisfaction when it was over. It almost feels like the film was only part of a story.",
    "6": "But at least there isn't any equally-nonsensical dialogue to go along with the ridiculous, illogical and hyper-stylized action.If you are looking for dumb flash about a guy going on an urban cleanse of some hard-working criminals, this will scratch your itch. That does go on and on and on and on.Kid Cudi is in it. And I can say this, Kid Cudi needed a manicure. That is about all the characterization his character is given.Other than that, the movie is violence on violence with a super-sized side order of violence. Oh and it is book-ended with some overly-sentimental maudlin garbage for the first half-hour and last half-minute.",
    "7": "This movie is complete garbage. I expected so much more from the director John Woo and leading role Joel Kinneman. 2023's biggest flop of the year. Keep in mind, John Woo directed Mission Impossible 2 back in 2002 and here we are 20 years later with this disappointment of a movie. The best part about the movie is that nobody speaks which tells you a lot about what to expect. Terrible writing and atrocious acting is something I never thought I'd write in a movie review with Joel Kinneman but here we are. This is what happens when the Writers Guild goes on strike and you have some random baboon writing your script. As most movies nowadays, the previews are the best parts of the movie. Stay home and wait for it to release on some streaming service platform. John Woo, just retire if you're going to make trash movies like this.",
    "8": "Honestly I knew from the beginning I wasn't going to like this film, I could tell it was going to overuse shots to try and tell a story and it may sound good and unique on paper but it was boring. It just doesn't work with such a weak storyline, especially when the protagonist is so dislikeable.I understand it was meant to be a little spin on silent movies but the story was way too generic for me to care and the action scenes weren't even all that good especially after making us wait until half the film was over for it to kick in.We just get weird stares and no one communicating which gets a little frustrating to watch. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",
    "9": "This movie is probably not going to satisfy a lot of people who would rather watch a movie with few million dollars in budget and loads of CGI work. Yes you might have seen a similar movie about revenge and sadness, but everyone griefs differently, so don't listen to haters and moaners.It is definitely not a movie you'd watch with kids under 15 (plus/minus 2) years old.For a movie that doesn't rely on heavy and deep conversations, this one gets the point across and delivers more than you would expect. It shows a person's will to make peace with themselves and not give up until they reach their goal.Watch it with an open mind, and enjoy the movie with not much of distractions of talking.",
    "10": "Taylor Michael Godlock (Alex Briseño) age 7, is killed by a stray bullet in a drive-by gang fight in El Paso, Texas. His father Brian (Joel Kinnaman) seeks revenge and learns the hard way not to take a pipe to a gunfight. He is shot in the throat hence the \"silent\" in the title wordplay. He decides he wants revenge as soon as he recovers from multiple gun wounds. He works out, builds a muscle car, learns to drive, watches fight videos, and learns to shoot. During this time his wife Saya (Catalina Sandino Moreno) leaves him. He marks Christmas Eve as the day he wants to kill all the gangs. Detective Dennis Vassell (Kid Cudi) is assigned to the case.The scenes lasted too long. We know Brian is grieving but I didn't need long drawn out scenes of him with his imaginary son. On the plus side, in spite of his training, Brian still messes things up making the film somewhat realistic. I never really cared about Joel Kinnaman in this feature, his character was dark and melancholy.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",
    "11": "I saw Silent Night, starring Joel Kinnaman-the Suicide Squad movies, RoboCop_2014; Catalina Sandino Moreno-Barbarians, The Bridge_tv; Kid Cudi-House Party_2023, Need For Speed and Harold Torres-Memory, Run Coyote Run_tv.This movie is directed by John Woo and takes place on Christmas Eve. So, like Die Hard, it IS a Christmas movie-Ho, Ho, Ho. Joel plays a man that is playing in his front yard with his 7 year old son on Christmas Eve when his son is caught in the cross fire of 2 gangs shooting at each other. While Catalina, Joel's wife, cradles their dead son, Joel gives chase on foot and gets left for dead when he is shot several times-once in the throat-and looses his voice from the incident. Kid plays the policeman assigned the case and Harold is the gang leader that did the shooting. After Joel's release from the hospital, he grieves and then decides to get his revenge, one year later-he marks his calendar saying Kill them all on Christmas Eve. He spends the year by doing all the action star regiments; getting in physical shape, learning to shoot a gun and learning how to use a knife and of course, he learns how to drive a souped up car with reinforced armor plating. If you like John Woo movies, you should enjoy this one. If you think there is too much talking in action movies, you should really like this one, because there is not a single line of dialogue in the whole film. That's right, you have dialogue free violence.It's rated R for strong bloody violence, drug use and language-I know, you are wondering how there could be language with no dialogue. It's all by graffiti, text or radio transmissions-and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",
    "12": "Silent NightAs the previews revealed, this is the standard story of: family is taken or killed, man swears revenge, man gets revenge in a beautiful video game-like blood bath.What makes this film different is that he cannot talk. In fact, there is very little dialogue at all in the entire movie, and that was such a different spin on this. There's lots of things blowing up, lots of scowling, lots of blood everywhere, and my personal favorite: man get shot multiple times yet in the span of less than a year turns into a ripped bodybuilder with perfect athletic ability. But little talking, and not much background music other than what the characters are playing on their radios.I loved it even with its predictability only because of said lack of dialogue. I give it more thumbs up than I would have simply because of that. I marked this with spoilers because I didn't realize that more than our main character would be silent.",
    "13": "In Silent Night, a grieving father enacts his long-awaited revenge against a ruthless gang on Christmas Eve.An extremely dull silent film here, with the great Joel Kinnaman of \"The Killing.\" Like the protagonist was unable to speak, but his wife or whatever and everyone else simply didn't for any reason at all and the grieving visually goes on for so long. It's not just the absence of dialogue, it's the absence of anything, I lost interest. Like Detective Kid Cudi sees him looking at photos of suspects at the station and never does a thing, yet involve him later on, why bother. Trying to be innovative... go back to the basics maybe.",
    "14": "My wife and I got brunch and drank a little too much to drive home so we decided to watch this while sobering up. I wish I just drove home drunk. It's terrible and borderline unwatchable. 1 hour of tense music with zero action and no talking before anything happens.He just casually drives into some big gang war with bullets flying all over the place and kills 10 people the gets out of his car and stands around while everyone is still shooting and doesn't even get shot at.Terrible plot. Terrible writing. Directing. Everything about this movie is awful. I'm still in the theaters and there's about 30 minutes left but I've had zero enjoyment so far.",
    "15": "Silent Night is a fairly standard revenge action flick, but with one caveat: there is almost zero dialogue throughout the movie. Even with the rule \"show, don't tell,\" creating a complete movie with no dialogue seems highly difficult. So how did they accomplish this so well?In my mind it's two things. First is a great performance by Kinnaman. His silent acting conveys everything you need to know. Second is a fantastic musical score that can carry the focus and fill in the void. I've been asking for movies where the music is a heavier focus, with extended action sequences with nothing but music. Here is a good example.The action is awesome. Visceral and intimate like the rest of the movie. And the emotional moments hit well. Overall an entertainingly good time. (1 viewing, 12/19/2023)",
    "16": "This is one of the worst movies I've seen all year. Mind numbingly boring, absolutely no dialogue. No one talks the whole movie even characters who can talk don't talk. Main character gets stabbed shot a whole bunch of times but keeps going. Cop gets shot twice in the chest but keeps going. If you have an IQ of 5 maybe you'll find this movie enjoyable. I don't know why the studio made this movie, it's hard to believe they paid all this money to produce complete trash. I'm not a writer but I know for a fact I could write a better script than this. It's unfortunate I do like the main actor in other films.",
    "17": "Joel Kinnaman (The Suicide Squad, Sympathy For The Devil) is a madman out for revenge in this silent action thriller called Silent Night... Also starring Catalina Sandino Moreno, Kid Cudi and Harold Torres... It's from John Woo, the director of movies like The Killer (1989), Face/Off (1997), Broken Arrow (1996) and Hard Target (1993) who is a master of films, and he is finally back with a bang! It's an explosive Christmas themed action film with no dialogue, loads of action, violence, battle sequences, car chases, stunts and a beautiful score from Marco Beltrami... Silent Night is a movie that is up there with Die Hard, Violent Night and other action films that will be awesome to see every year during Christmas time... It's definitely a must see for action fans...",
    "18": "Despite a large bulk is silent the action is exceptional and quite sad in the first half yet so worth it at least in my opinion. It's like as if John Woo got ideas from John Wick films and his own genius action style which is fire! Joel Kinaman is an impressive manly actor that is enjoyable in anything he's part of. It's wild how there's barely much dialogue mostly swift sounds, essential talking when needed, music, and epic flow of action. Silent Night might get much appreciation but at least John Woo is still a legend in his craft at such an old age that's always outstanding to me when older folks make great work - no matter what anyone thinks it's worth it for action fans.",
    "19": "4 out of 5 stars.Silent Night is a good action thriller film that brings John Woos directing style back. And he delivers with a revenge action thriller. The action sequences delivers. The gun shoot out scenes are thrilling. And best with his style. Joel Kinnaman delivers with his performance. The film also has barely any dialogue to none at all. Which still works. Weird in some scenes as other characters do not speak. Understand with Joel Kinnaman as he gets shot at his throat which he cant speak at all. The action delivers. The music score is good that works with the tone and direction. May not be Woos best film but it is a good comeback.",
    "20": "John Woo. People say he's a great action director, I've never felt that way. This movie is badly paced, absolutely laugh out loud funny when it's trying to be serious Becuase for some reason no characters speak. The action is dull to such a degree it's almost impressive. The car chases are clearly shot so slowly that the intense high revving engine sounds turn it into a bad cartoon. It's shot absolutely terribly, with some awful digital zoom moments that fill the screen with low rez garbage. So much slow mo and none of it was needed. Want to see a non dramatic shot slowed down for no reason then this is the movie for you!Joel Kinneman is good and remotes well. The other actors try to make it make sense that they don't talk but there's only so much they can do.John Woo can't shoot action, or story.",
    "21": "John Woo returns to form has an action director, with also intense dramatic acting, never letting one overshadowing the other.Joel Kinneman plays a grieving father, who's young son was accidently killed in a gang shootout, and has damage done to his throat and is unable to speak. Decides to embark on a quest for revenge, to take down everybody responsible, but the question is will he.John Woo direction is beyond terrific, action and shootout scenes are so awesome, it could make John Wick blush. Joel Kinneman really displays such good emotions without speaking, and does it quite perfectly. And the rest of the movie pulls it off quite well , saying very little.",
    "22": "Watching John Woo's \"Silent Night\" and as much as I hate to admit it, I'm kind of bored.Also, the lack of dialogue from ANYONE is just weird. Sure, he can't talk due to being shot (it's in the trailer, hardly a spoiler) but the others haven't been shot. Having no one else speak just takes away the impact of the MC losing his own voice.I'm also struggling with the fact this guy has zero training but thinks he is going to take on the whole criminal underworld - training himself with YouTube videos in his basement.I guess, all I'm saying is, if you want a decent \"You shot my kid, I must kill you all\" revenge film - check out Kevin Bacon's \"Death Sentence\".",
    "23": "This was just so depressing with zero levity. They really hammer home the sadness. I laughed out loud at how ridiculous a few things were. There were a few points where I was like \"Yes. John Woo!\" But mostly I was just struck with profound sadness. The trailer makes it look fun. It's not fun. There is zero fun.I do love Joel Kinneman. He does a great job with zero dialogue.I cannot recommend anyone see this movie. Especially anyone with small children. I left the theater and my husband said it looked like I'd \"been through something\". And here I am, hours later, still peeved about how upsetting this movie was.",
    "24": "After seeing the trailer, it looks promising and lot to offer, but to my surprise it's literally a \"silent\" film no\nVerbal communications, which find me extremely boring that it made me slept almost the duration of the film, having the thought it's a nonstop action film from start to finish. In fact, I get those non verbal communication by their acting and soundtrack or music injected, but it doesn't gave genuine justification of all the characters showed, to the point you might just keep guessing or build your own story, which I find it intriguing. Plot for me is all over, no clear establishment of scenes, most of the time you'll find depressing, and at times feel\nAngry watching it, as it defeats the purpose of enjoying the film as a whole. If I were you, I'll pass on this one.",
    "25": "Not only is the protagonist mute, but no one else in the film says a word. This might work if the cinematography, fight choreography, soundtrack, plot, and themes were stronger. But they aren't.This is your run-of-the-mill story about a parent training for a brief period of time to take on a vicious gang in a revenge mission. If you've seen one you've seen them all. The first half drags as we jump between long shots of the father and mother mourning their loss (silently) and the actual incident that killed their son (long and drawn out). Finally we get to the rampage, but the choreography isn't strong enough to make up for the utterly dull first half.",
    "26": "John Woo's \"Silent Night\" has no right to be this good; it's an emotionally devastating, brutal action flick that truly hits you hard and then some. The movie, devoid of dialogue which never gets annoying or irritating is filled with immense emotional heft, and it delivers ridiculously entertaining, ludicrous almost john wick style action. While the storyline is a variant of \"Punisher\" and \"Death Wish,\" it's crafted with such style and panache that you're utterly captivated throughout. I was pleasantly surprised-Joel Kinnaman is an absolute force in this.It was like being transported back to the 90s.",
    "27": "2023 movie season finished in perfection with this film. Silent Night was perfect. When I first heard it was coming out I thought it was a revamp of the horror film from the eighties. Lol.\"Revenge is a dish best served cold ....\" - KhanThis film touched on allot of topics that we all suffer during grief. He acted on how we feel on grief and major losses.We gave it a 10/10, across the board. IMDb gave it a 6.4!! Why?!!! It was perfectly done. No lines said, just screaming and texting. The action sequences were John Woo perfection, I wanted more action and gore. It deserved more gore. The wife's scenes were rough. They separated, not divorced. You can feel the grief and the pain. It was amazingly written that he prepared for 8 months. I cheered him on all the action scenes. Every time he felt out of it. He kept playing that music box thing to keep his motivation going.Perfection Perfection!!! I'll watch it again, maybe we missed something. Lol.",
    "28": "The worst sound editing you will ever experience.I am sure they are going to sell it as \"art\" or \"progressive\" or who knows what else!I' ve watched a ton of silent movies and they had better sound than this carbagge.There are a lot o plot holes also.The gangsters are side by side (30cm / 1 foot) with machine guns shooting hundrends of bullets per minute but to each other but no one gets hurt.The protagonist gets one bullet straight to his adam's apple from the front, but nooooo, the bullet stops on his vocal hordes! He also bleeds liters of blood while entering the hospital. Paramedics did nothing for that.And again. Worst sound editing EVERAlso he lives in USA. The medical expenses should be 500,000 $, he doesn't go to work, he buys a brand new mustang, fire arms, Nikon cameras,...\nHe is playing with his children and he hears multiple shootings coming to his way, but noooo, he doesn't care. He stays oudtside having his boy into the air.",
    "29": "I've never written a review for this site but felt compelled to do so after seeing how many great reviews this movie received. These reviews are obviously plants because no one in the right mind could say this was anywhere to close or even average.First off, there is almost no action in the entire film. What you see in the trailer is the entirety of the action. The story is a simple revenge one yet, spends an hour and a half focused on the main character's training and preparation. Whereas every other sensible movie would devote maybe a montage of a few minutes to this, Silent Night spends the entire movie on it. All the action is literally in the last 10 minutes, and any moment of action is often interrupted until the next moment of action a few minutes later. There's no continuous action scene. That's why I say what you see in the trailer is all the action there is.The first 30 minutes of the film are spent on the character grieving the loss of his son. 30 MINUTES!!! There's absolutely nothing happening during this time. The movie keeps beating a dead horse over and over and over, and once that's done, they spend an hour on the character training, over and over and over. You literally get to almost the end of the film before anything happens. I kept watching the time on my phone to see how much time had passed.This doesn't feel like a John Woo film at all. I refuse to believe he did it as it contains none of his style. No doves, no dual-wielding pistols until very late and very short, no extended action scenes, no flair.The movie was obviously shelved for a long time as the main character uses a 2022 calendar to plan his attack. This movie was probably meant to release last year but people realized how bad it was.I can't say how disappointed and frustrated I was by this film. I was super excited to see a John Woo action film in theatres, to see the master back in action, as the trailer mentioned. But it was pure false advertisement.",
    "30": "My comments regarding this movie are as Silent as the movie itself.There is no vocal script, something not seen since the silent era.The acting was abysmal, kinsman will most likely get a razzy award for this movie, as his acting in altered carbon, or Robocop could be considered his better work.The only house of cards here, is how quickly Silent Night falls apart. The trailer, and their is only one, which is totally misleading, which brings me to the title of this review.Just ask for your money back or credit to beekeeper, because this movie aside from a few action sequences really fell on its face ... took a bullet to the jugular.",
    "31": "I was really looking forward to watching John Woo's return to directing but was left somewhat disheartened unfortunately.This is your typical revenge film. Is the action shot well? Yes of course. Does the story do anything different? No not at all. A child accidentally gets killed then a father goes on a revenge spree.... When it eventually gets to that. The middle of the film is really slow and I was wondering at times if John Woo had forgotten how to direct, it could have been brilliant but something was just lacking for me aside from the action which doesn't come until the end. Watch if you've got nothing else to see but don't be expecting Hard Boiled, The Killer or Face Off level John Woo here, not even close.",
    "32": "This film is combination of two old genres: action and silent cinema. Its not perfect but I have seen a lot of movies full of nonsense dialogues that wish to be half as much interesting this year. I enjoyed learning about the context through just visuals. It was simple, straightforward and easy to execute. Action scenes were fun. Yes, this is not John Wick. It doesn't has to be. This guy's son has been killed by gangsters. John Wick confesses that he just wants to kill all of them as if he has nothing better to do at some point. But this one has a bigger motivation imo. Despite all the preparation the writer still keeps him flawed because HE IS NOT A TRAINED KILLER and John Woo shows us this whenever he can. Brain is just a grieving father who tries to do his best. Give the man credit for his efforts at least.",
    "33": "This movie is billed as action packed. It is not. It likely caters for a portion of the audience who enjoy film-making and some of John Woo's technical prowess.Unfortunately this doesn't make for a good movie to watch. The Action sequences are good, no doubt.To unlock these scenes you have to first engage in a character story, so sad and aimless, that you have no energy left for the enjoyable final quarter of the movie.I left the cinema feeling down trodden and unsatisfied. A warning for people who have been through tough mental health issues or the loss of a child should be included as the director insisted on pushing the point to a level excessive for a movie billed as mainstream.",
    "34": "You will probably see reviews stating this movie has no dialog. That's not entirely true. There is dialog heard over the radio. And there is a line spoken by someone who has been gagged. But on the whole it's pretty much true that there is no dialog, and that's a good thing in my opinion.Early in the movie the main character loses his voice by having been shot in the neck. Rather than show what it's like for someone to try to live in a world of speaking people without being able to speak yourself, the movie simply goes with no dialog. Dialog is not actually necessary. Everything you need to know is clear from what happens visually.Early in the movie you see a single red balloon floating up in the air. You figure that's symbolic of something but you don't know what at first - maybe something corny.After a few scenes, it becomes clear it's because the main character's son was killed by stray gunfire by gang members. The balloon scene is repeated, this time with the context in place.The rest of the movie is about the main character plotting his revenge. He first prepares himself, doing appropriate calisthenics, gun practice and practice driving. This all, of course, foreshadows what is to come in the rest of the movie.Lots of believable gun shot scenes as well as chase scenes, not as over-the-top as in the Fast and Furious franchise.In my opinion, this is one of the best films of the year.",
    "35": "Maybe I'm just not familiar with John Woo movies, but I was sadly disappointed at the a lack action, considering the commercial highlights. The focus was far too much on the families loss, and very little on the action, and I was kind of wishing the movie was over from the start.Also found it hyper focused on some moments that just didn't add to the movie at all. (Ie. The gang leader shooting up his girlfriend on heroin). I just didn't see the point in some of these moments as they really didn't add anything in the end. Maybe my problem was simply the complete lack of dialogue.All in all, if it popped up on the TV one night, I probably wouldn't use my time to watch it.",
    "36": "I have followed John Woo's career through the decades and was looking forward to seeing this film. And at its premiere in Buenos Aires, in its first performance, I was one of the lucky ones who saw this work of art. Woo has given us some of the best action films of all time when he worked with his actor fetish, the great Chow Yun Fat. In this case Woo returns to work in the US to deliver a film that is a challenge; Can you tell a story without dialogue? Normally an action story requires defining a situation, drawing the characters, showing their motivations.... But it is a huge challenge to do it simply by relying on acting and music. It is a fantastic film with wonderful moments. It's not Hard Boiled or The Killer; With this I say that you will not find extreme moments but you will find beauty, action and emotion that will penetrate your heart and leave a mark. With the right preparation and attitude, this film is a transformative experience.",
    "37": ". . . and nothing evokes the bittersweet tear-jerking poignancy like model trains and music boxes. SILENT NIGHT is chock full of both, offering viewers a gunned-down toddler's bedroom featuring an eternal Thomas the Tank Engine railroad which outlives the grieving father, as well as a battery-powered Lionel train set which Dad wraps up Christmas Eve, then unwraps and constructs around Junior's headstone prior to wiping out all the tattooed population of Los Angeles. Ever present till his dying moment is Junior's favorite music box, a simple affair playing a brief bar of haunting melody. Unlike THANKSGIVING, SILENT NIGHT (2023) is a tasteful holiday film.",
    "38": "My wife and I saw the movie tonight going in with high expectations, but we were let down by this movie big time.The story setup took about 30 minutes. There is no talking. We get the gist of the story within the first 10 minutes of the movie. After you thoroughly get filled in on the background, you get to watch 30 minutes on how to work out, fire guns, and stab someone effectively. If you make it this far, you will be able to enjoy roughly 30 minutes of mediocre action. It has some very cheesy scenes that make it mediocre for me.Watch the movie at home if you must. After you understand the plot, skip ahead until the action scenes. You'll be glad you did.",
    "39": "I was hoping to like this movie but it never really got going. It's a revenge movie but doesn't really have much of an actual detailed storyline to it. Plenty of shooting and stabbing action but in the end you really don't care about any of the characters and whether or not they live or die. If you're expecting something like Deathwish, John Wick, etc don't waste your time. They could have done a lot more in the hero part of the story and make you really want to root for the grieving father but even there you never really get to that point. I tried...I really did but I just left the theater disappointed in this film and have no interest in recommending it to anyone else.",
    "40": "This has to be one of the worst movies. The opening scene made you believe it would be good, it was emotional, you felt everything the parents were going through to start. The graphic nature of the initial chase was pretty gruesome and so realistic. It all went downhill after that, nothing made sense. Guy lives in a terrible neighborhood near all these gangs, but has wads of cash to buy things. Stray bullets from gang violence was the cause of the drama with him and the gangs yet by the end of movie he is shooting at the gangs up and down the streets. Random detective shows up all the time but they never actually engage with each other. It's called Silent night but dude comes in blazing with gun fire, the reference of why it's called Silent Night has to be the dumbest ever since everyone else is talking in it. It's just bad, don't waste your time you'll have so many questions. The director did great with all the actions shots and fight scenes they had some pretty dope shots in the film, the plot was just not there.",
    "41": "As a fan of both action films and revenge tales I can say this movie is an injustice to both. A dialogue choice by the director which was meant to be clever made it hard to connect to the main characters and made the pacing of the first 35 minutes almost unbearable. The main training montage which was intended to be hardcore and inspirational came across as laughable and cringeworthy. The few moments where good fight choreography and beautiful violence poked through we're not enough to overcome the abysmal acting and nerve straining soundtrack/audio devices. This is a movie that is not worth watching on cable while laid up in a hospital bed. It's honestly that bad. If you go forth anyway, at least I did my best to warn you.",
    "42": "Watched this on a whim, loved it, the action was fantastic, plot was good, very simple film to watch, dont think too much, just enjoy the ride, last part of the film was amazing! Have no idea how some people are rating it low, end the ending was really nice.Highly recommend.Watched this on a whim, loved it, the action was fantastic, plot was good, very simple film to watch, dont think too much, just enjoy the ride, last part of the film was amazing! Have no idea how some people are rating it low, end the ending was really nice.Highly recommend this film to anyone who likes action films etc.",
    "43": "A good performance from Joel Kinnaman. Great action scenes as well. But the movie tends to be overly depressing most of the time. But what really brings the whole film down is that John Woo abandons his signature dove shots, but puts a parakeet in instead. It's an obvious attempt to try and throw the audience off, as if to say \"Nobody puts Woo in a box.\". Well, it didn't work John. We all know what kind of filmmaker you are. You're a birb man and doves are your muse. Do not fight your nature. The the doves flow freely. It's what you want. It's what we want. Do better. Be yourself.1 parakeet. Zero doves. 1/10 stars.",
    "44": "A frustratingly lethargic piece of writing was saved by John Woo's action sensibility.I know that it is imperative for any story (let alone a tale of revenge) to have a strong buildup, a solid foundation to build on, but to administer more than half of a script in that cause seems immoderate as well as unsound, especially when the movie is supposed to rely largely on action and thrill and not so much on the dramatic portion.Regardless, the film does considerably better once it reaches the climax phase, carrying a certain sense of raw, relentless energy, which I cherished. If only the rest left more or less the same impression, I would have been more generous with the rating!",
    "45": "The build up was nice and along with the silence but the cop portion felt forced along with the ending with the bad guys chick scene at the end. It was okay, wasn't expecting most of the movie to be silent but the action and emotional aspect of the movie was for sure there.Synopsis:\nA gritty revenge tale of a tormented father who witnesses his young son die when caught in a gang's crossfire on Christmas Eve. While recovering from a wound that costs him his voice, he makes vengeance his life's mission and embarks on a punishing training regimen in order to avenge his son's death. Rating: R (Strong Bloody Violence, some Language, Drug Use)",
    "46": "Very poor directing, too many mistakes, too much emotion in the movie like it's a drama or some sort of it. More than half of the movie passes in grief and training. All the training he did was also useless. Can't handle one guy properly. Shooting scenes are also funny. Unreal. I like the actor but he just wasted himself on this movie.Honestly fell asleep couple of times during the movie. Since it's about vengeance then must be action packed and not some emotion packed drama. All excitement was dead after watching first 30 mins of the movie. Very disappointed. The trailer was catching but the whole movie is absolutely trash!",
    "47": "All a bit underpowered and dare I say it, a bit boring! Nothing much seems to happen for most of the runtime, the lack of dialogue prevents any real character development or relationships to develop between the protagonists, the merciless killing machine super hero appears to have learned all his skills from you tube, whilst regaining his strength from lifting weights in his garage, he also seems to have access to large wads of cash without any explanation as to why!To be fair, I always find myself judging any John Woo offering against Hard Boiled and always end up disappointed, this is no exception,",
    "48": "I'll preface this review by saying it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. But if you line violence filled films you'll like this oneThe story is very basic and not really well paced in the beginning. The arc of the main catcher is pretty meh. I just didn't feel connected to toss story that much. But the action scenes were great and well choreographed. There's plenty of slow mo which OS pretty typical for a John Woo film.The lack of dialogue does hurt the film. Very few films have been able to pull of a film worth next to no dialogue from the main character. You need powerful supporting characters and's this film didn't have it. The main actor OSS great but he's not an emotional actor so he's alil out of his element imo.",
    "49": "Those who are specifically fathers not dads, theres a big difference by the way, anyone can be a dad but it takes a man to be a father. A silent movie no spoken words very easily explained theres no words that can describe the pain of losing a child no words can bring those responsible to justice, he did what any father would do in that situation he pushed his wife away so she was in no danger, he then trained physically, trained to shoot firearms, plotted revenge, taught himself how to drive under pressure and handle a car chase without losing control. He then carried out his revenge a year to the day, did his homework on those responsible and effectively took down the cartel responsible with no intention of walking out alive. He did what any father would do for their children DIE for themJoel kinnaman does a great job of also being one of the producer while his emotional turmoil adds a vitality to an age old revenge saga...Over 20+ stuntsmen team the stunts sequence is a major attraction to the flick that too a legendary director onboard one can expect a sky high octane action sequence but director being specialist enough adds a required amount of stunts...What else watch it for Joel kinnaman once.",
    "50": "Expected way more Acc to reviews for mths and John woo but it was to slow and nearly same story as Jennifer garners peppermint only diff was peppermint was watchable once or twice.This def not more fun with fat man etc this had action mostly last 25 mins to slow and action esp from John woo I assumed be more hand to hand sadly made it look like John woo has gave up feed bad for Joel like him as a actor but his last few are bad needs new or better agent but def silent night should be called sleep night as after first ten minutes is when you wonder what the heck has John woo done unless it was the studio but if I was you don't bother.",
    "51": "I can't really place why I'm not into this movie. The action scenes are well done, there is some suspense, the revenge motivation is pretty standard, and the plot device that no one speaks is interesting, but still it just became a bit meh.I like Joel Kinneman but never really thought of him as a particularly super action hero. I mean, his motivations in this movie is pretty clear cut but there were things that just didn't make the movie click for me.I think one of the big things for me is that other than him getting his revenge on the gang, there weren't any thing else since we already know his son was already dead. It's wasn't like the gang kidnapped his wife and held her hostage, so there was nothing else at stake other than to kill them.And then I guess that's were some of the disconnects like the scene with the bound gangster, and he simply puts the knife in front of the guy. Sure he has hands cuffed, but honestly? And that last scenes with the pschyo biche with the machine gun. He gets the drop on her, then puts his gun down expecting some kind of compassion play? She takes the opportunity to put a bullet in him and the detective.So anyways, yeah I can understand the dad is going through his arc, but still some of those scenes just break the movie for me.",
    "52": "The Producers give John Woo a obviously Low Budget , No Dialogue Script and a not really charismatic or likeable Lead Actor (I prefer way more Jean Claude Van Damme , Chow Yun Fat or Nicolas Cage). The Plot is a typically generic Revenge Action Thriller, this Film also disappoints with his emotional elements, It tries to be very emotional but failed and why must be the action scenes so John Wick oriented ? There is very little John Woo Style in Silent Night and the CGI Blood was also annoying. At least 2-3 Action Scenes in the Final Showdown were decent. As a Big Fan of John Woo - I would rate this with generous 6/10 Stars.",
    "53": "What an absolute pile of garbage. I'm a historically fair film grader, but this is up there with the worst trash I've ever seen made.It's like someone got super high around Christmas while listening to silent night and said \"let's make a movie without dialogue!\"I mean Chaplin and Keaton and others pulled it off how hard can it be? Hard apparently, cause this is utter freaking trash.Don't waste your time. If you really want t be entertained and see something good with Joel Kinnaman go watch the TV series The Killing.I'll also add that they attempted ti save this film with violent action scenes, but they really do nothing to break the horrible pace and lack of character development in the film.",
    "54": "\"Silent Night\" is one of the most fun theater experiences I've had all year.I saw this movie opening night and didn't realize until the night before that the film contained no dialogue. I was wary at first, but the lack of dialogue actually enhances the film.We follow Godlock (played by Joel Kinnaman), a silent hero left for dead and out for blood, hellbent on finding and killing the gang that murdered his young son on Christmas day. Wading through marriage problems, alcoholism, and depression, he decides to dedicate the next year to strengthening his body, honing his combat, and training with weapons.Christmas eve is when the blood begins to flow. He suits up and kills every member of the gang, ending with an epic shootout against the gang boss with the assistance of a friendly rogue cop, played by Kid Cudi.The most evocative part of the movie comes when Godlock finally kills the boss, but dies in the process. As we see him smile and reminisce about memories of his son, only to later be laid to rest with him, leaving a note to his wife apologizing and affirming his love for her despite his distance since their son's death. I like that this ending is a subversion of expectation, choosing to portray the character realistically rather than turning him into some untouchable Hollywood hero.Overall, the action is the typical ballet-like bloodbath we want from a Woo movie. This is a movie for those who like the bullets hot, the blood pumping, and some classic white-knuckle action.",
    "55": "This was an amazing movie. The people who complain about the \"lack of storyline\" obviously have never seen a John Woo film (Face Off, Hard Boiled). His films always told a story through visuals. This movie is no different. Plus the lack of an actual script...you had to actually watch the movie. Boo hoo...you had to pay attention to whats on the screen rather than words being said. This is one of the most creative amd best action movies i have seen in a long time. If you are looking for great action and bloody violence...this is your movie. You want a deep storyline that explains why people seem to \"never run out if bullets\" go somewhere else. I tip my hat to you...John Woo. I great time no liquor needed.",
    "56": "I went in hoping for a perfectly-stylish, revenge-driven John Woo film, and got exactly that.The lack of dialogue didn't even feel like a gimmick; to me, it enhanced the despair, grief, rage, and all the stark brutality. Many times, an action movie is rendered corny by its hammy dialogue. No such issues here.Some reviewers have commented on the movie being profoundly sad, due to both the child dying, and the protagonist presumably dying in the end. I'll just say that his final act poetically softens that blow, in my eyes.I'll say that Silent Night does take a little while to get going, but when it does, it's exactly what you'd ask for from a Woo movie: action, creativity, and signature flair..",
    "57": "This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I don't cry easily- one of my biggest issues- but my eyes were watering watching this move. Even thinking about it now makes my heart hurt.Of course this is a difficult topic- for a grieving father going through the sudden loss of such a young child is never easy. That be it- grief of any kind. Joel is so expressive despite not speaking the whole movie. Seeing the look in his eyes when he's thinking of his son made my heart break just a little bit more.I'm not trying to drive people away by saying that it's sad- I just mean it was such a strong point for the movie. I don't think I've ever cried at a movie before until this. And somehow, it was pleasurable. It's sad because it's real. And maybe people haven't killed over 10 people because of the loss of their kid, but his emotions make you feel like you could maybe do the same thing.The ending scene really messed me up in the best way. The set design is insane. Such a gorgeous scene. It's a perfect 'life flashing before my eyes' scene without making it seem like a repeate of every other movie out there. He looked relived. It was bittersweet.I could rant about this movie forever. I can't wait to rewatch this movie. I'll be thinking about it for the next lifetime.",
    "58": "I quit watching this thing.with 5 minutes.First scene, 2 cars are driving by.and shooting each other. That was great, but they were shooting the wheels or the doors (you know door's can't stand 9mm, right? Now you do) instead of people inside the cars.Following scene a car is rushing a guy in a hallway. The windshield is already shattered. Instead of firing through the windshield, the guys are firing diagonally at the walls because they can't put the bodies outside the car, but they MUST shoot something.Good luck for whoever likes to watch elite soldiers and goons firing 6 magazines to hit one bullet.",
    "59": "The basic premise is man has a family, man looses child to gang shootout, man gets shot in the throat, man sinks into despair, man vows revenge . All this happens without him being able to speak.I was looking forward to this movie, as John Woo has made some great films. Unfortunately his return to the action movie genre doesn't have the same impact as his previous endeavours. The counterpoint between loud action and silent preparations might have been good if the storyline had been a bit more...well... more. It felt like a B-movie where they couldn't get too creative due to financial constraints.",
    "60": "So, my only problem is this... how do you miss 5 words (3, if combining/hyphenating) of actual spoken dialogue (by a background gangbanger on the stairs) in editing? He clearly yells out \"... you motherf*&^%3#... motherf#$@^%!\" as they try to kill each other on the stairs. Not a single other character says anything anywhere in the movie. This isn't just playing music over a conversation... no conversations are to had anywhere, except by text or letter. Even the background noise/chatter is scrubbed. Again, how does editing miss this? It needs to be taken out... It kind of disrupted things for me.I enjoyed the film... I really like Kinneman's movies/TV. Except for the abysmal RoboCop rehash (not his fault though, that's on the witers and director). Again, I enjoyed it just fine. It is what it is ... a revenge fantasy movie. Everbody does a great job conveying thought and emotion with just facial expressions and body language (much better than some other films that have tried this). The action is good all the way around and it's a pretty simple premise, nothing extra needed.",
    "61": "This film is a low point for John Woo. No one is expecting Oscar worthy acting or a solid story telling but a director with a reputation for directing classics like Hard Boiled and The Killer should hold his head in shame attaching his name to this film. John Woo has a style and as a fan of that style seeing something that looks like everything else we see in lower tier action films you will also be surprised by how low this rates. There are no redeeming qualities to take away from this really bad film.You want a good John Woo film; see above. Want a better revenge flick; see John Wick; want a better Christmas inspired action movie; see Die Hard. DO NOT SEE THIS!!!",
    "62": "I've seen one Woo movie I think-Hard Target decent Van Damme movie. Its hard too imagine a studio financing an action movie with no dialogue. Guess maybe budget was low no big names in it. Really fascinating how the face,on screen texting,action itself,created a mood where talking wasn't necessary. Of course main actor carried the movie. Very expressive face. Never seen an experiment like it but for most part it worked. I could definitely see the John Wick influence on Woo. About the last 30 minutes just gets a little ridiculous lol. Bad guy dancing with his chick with hundred lit light fixtures above them. Sometimes you gotta suspend disbelief like unless your an MMA fighter Noone can take abuse main guy goes thru. Anyway glad I seen it. Someone tried something different unique.",
    "63": "After reading some positive reviews I made the mistake of wasting almost two hours of my life on this unoriginal, tedious, manipulative drivel. It's a revenge film in the style of the Equalizer or Nobody films minus the humour, charm, dialogue and everything else. It was beyond predictable. What are the people who reviewed this film favourably thinking?It was a relief there was no dialogue as at least it offered the possibility of a nap at any stage during the film. There were intermittent scenes of sentamentality which appeared insincere and forced.Violence as in John Wick can be entertaining but none of the violence was entertaining. The over the top violence surrounding where he lived was almost like a parody. This film has no redeeming features whatsoever. It's a waste of time. Don't bother.",
    "64": "Not much difference here from some independent YouTuber that decided to call all his friends and have some fun with fake and CGI blood.The fact that the movie has little to no dialogs doesn't add to the story and it's just plain unrealistic and moves you away from the experience..A few added scenes that defy laws of physics and just look janky..Really, it might seem at first that this is somehow a groundbreaking flick coming from great names like John Woo and Joel Kinneman and, why not, Kid Cudi, but really it's just a arguably racist collection of just fine shootings and hand fights.This is why cinema is dying: Good names, low story-telling quality.",
    "65": "It is very hard to write a review about this movie since there isn't much going on in it. The plot, is the same old revenge story we've seen in hundreds or thousands of movies before. A innovative or different twist? Not there. I suppose the idea of making it almost \"dialogue free\" was what was done to try to make it different, but for it just didn't do it, it actually made it worse. Some people love the fighting scenes and actually say they are excellent, but they're not good if you already know how it's going to end. Being \"pretty\" doesn't make up for a lack of story. Twenty minutes in and I was already paying more attention to my phone and waiting for the \"final battle\". Cliché, repetitive, boring. You do not need to see this movie. Trust me, you've seen it many times before.",
    "66": "I could read the plot like a book campy visuals throughout the film i literally created an account to bash on how boring this movie is during the movie currently if done well the silent aspect could've worked but this movie did not all around. Little. To no action along with little to no dialogue combines for a long drawn out story that could've been half the run time not even the sound track which in a silent movie you think would be killer like everything else is so generic movie felt like a walmart brand rendition of a terrible movie already i just think they thought the silent gimmick would give them more slack from people but there are no redeeming qualities.",
    "67": "Worst John Woo movie ever. They were not even trying! I get the no dialogue but the whole movie was like they weren't even trying. The story is on point to be like the Punisher but then it is just a let down. Is John Woo hurting for money? Because this movie was just as if some one asked him to do a revenge movie and he said ok. I payed $25 for this and I wish I could get my money back. It's as if they didn't even try!!! I am very disappointed in this movie that has no point !! They had everything there and they didn't even try to make something of it! I'm very disappointed in John Woo! Especially because he has the capability to do great things!",
    "68": "Unfortunately, this movie doesn't manage to create any Christmas references at all. Anyone expecting action in the style of \"Violent Night\" will be bitterly disappointed here. In the first 45 minutes you get the impression that you are watching a more special and non-mainstream/standard action movie. But this positive impression vanishes completely in the second half of the movie, which follows one action sequence after another. There is not one creative kill, just dull shootouts. The movie has one special feature that carries it, especially in the first half, which is why I still found it \"okay\" overall.",
    "69": "The movie for the most part is silent, makes you want to get up and leave. The first 3/4 of the movie is dead, slow boring and not worth the money it cost to see the movie.The last 1/4 of the movie you finally get some action; the action is slow paced. For those of you expecting action like you would find in Taken, John Wick, Jason Bourne or any action packed film do not waste the time or money on the movie; you will be greatly disappointed.Now if you want to see a movie in silence or a movie that will make you understand what a deaf person feels when watching a movie... this movie is for you.",
    "70": "Don't listen to the bad reviews i don't know what they smoked this was a very well done action movie and very emotional. The almost silent protagonist was very refreshing and the visual style and action scenes take a lead anyway. The emotional strength is only increased by this decison in my opinon. Story was simple but very effective realized. The stunts and in general the action scenes are superb. Go see it in cinema and have a blast.Go watch it in cinema\nGo watch it in cinema\nGo watch it in cinema\nGo watch it in cinema\nGo watch it in cinema\nGo watch it in cinema\nGo watch it in cinema\nGo watch it in cinema\nGo watch it in cinema.",
    "71": "We have all heard this term now and again! This movie proves it true, visuals in movies are always better than long drawn out dialogues between characters, often about non-trivial feelings, who is in the right, what gender and race is better or more oppressed and so on that we see in every movie and tv show for far too long now.It's a standard revenge action movie with an average Joe, i don't think i will remember or re-watch but for a one time sitting it was a perfect escape from the garbage that we are force fed and what to think and believe to be a \"good person\"It's good to see Joel Kinnaman in an action movie again! Think i'm gonna watch his RoboCop movie next.. he's just awesome!",
    "72": "Unfortunately as the title states this film lands face first. A true dud of a film despite legendary action director John Woo. Joel's performance was just okay in this film. I literally yawned in the opening set up of the storyline despite the situation the character is in to make him do what he does. In an ironic twist in terms of \"John Wick style\" action being that John Woo is a legend this effort painfully tries to be a bad John Wick style film. Halfway in the film I walked out because my head was going to explode from all the cliche nonsense. But congrats to everyone who worked on the film.",
    "73": "It had the potential to be a great movie but instead it was a silent movie the whole entire time. Not a single person said more than a dozen words. It was super annoying and a complete and utter waste of my time and money. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I have no idea who thought this would be a great action movie with NOOOOOOO freaking words... I can't express the disappointment we felt watching this. It should have to be listed as a silent movie so no one wastes their time unless they want to hear grunting for 2 hours... please don't make another one of these flops....... HATED IT😩😩😩😩",
    "74": "It hasn't got enough Christmas to be a fun bad Christmas action movie. It hasn't got the action to be a John Wick/Equalizer-like movie. It's nothing from both worlds.It started promising. Some nice action, Christmas sweater, and a nice jingle bell. Those five minutes had everything. But unfortunately, those five minutes were everything the entire movie had to offer.And did everyone get shot in the thought. I get that this guy lost his voice, but that no one utters a single word. This doesn't make sense, and doesn't help the movie.I finished the movie. That means it had enough to entertain me for 1,5 hour. Or I didn't have anything better to do. Because it failed to meet my low expectations, but I did finish it, 4 stars is all I have to offer.Merry Christmas.",
    "75": "I didn't realize how much action movies have changed since the 90's until I watched Silent Night. It follows along in typical John Woo fashion but with better visual effects. A lot of single shot kills that you say to yourself \"he's going to pop back up\" while watching. It's definitely not the next Die Hard that sparks debate over whether or not it's a Christmas movie. It won't be a film that you put into your annual Christmas rotation but it's worth a watch if your not expecting too much. The first few minutes get you excited with some real action then expect about 40 minutes of drawn out story at time filler.",
    "76": "I gave this movie two stars because A) some of the action scenes were good (note, \"some\") and B) I watched this on streaming so I could watch it at 1.5 speed (and some forward skipping).This would have been a good 30 minute action flick, but it just took \"slow burning\" to whole new level. Just by accident I watched The Killer a few nights ago, and compared to that movie one would not think it is the same director.Seriously, this was probably the worst action-flick I have seen this year. I don't care about your money, but don't waste your time on this one! A bad try be a John Wick meets Nobody meets Death Wish (Bruce Wiliis version).",
    "77": "Other than the sequence at the beginning, there was no action until an hour in. The training montage was 30-40 minutes when it should have been 10-15. The pacing was just off, so I hope they didn't cut out any action scenes.The movie was dialogue free, which was fine, but maybe they should have explored more about the characters. It wasn't exactly Christmas John Wick like I was hoping for.It was just tragedy turns man into PTSD- overwhelmed killing machine, it was both too real to life and not realistic enough. From the protagonist's perspective it was very single minded, which makes sense because he can't stop making the bad guys pay. But there was too many looks into his mind that shows us that he is just sad and traumatized inside.",
    "78": "I wont spoil anything, most of what I'm saying will be obvious from the beginning of the movie.Seriously I understand that the main protagonist of the movie can't speak, fair enough,but the fact that no one else talks makes the movie SO boring most of the time... Sure the action can be good (at times) but it all crashes be cause no one, NOT A SINGLE PERSON utters a word... honestly I could se myself liking this movie quit a bit had it not been for the all ruining silence...it's a shame to have such good actors, and then try to make an \"art film\" that simply falls flat... sadly a big miss.",

This picture still looks the part, but that is about the only positive I can find...The bad: the action only starts after 50 minutes. Besides an action packed opening scene of a few minutes no thrilling action to be seen during the first 50 minutes.Is the action any good then? Well yes and no. As I said before, the action looks great visually, but the action choreography is a bit lame, because gangsters get shot and stabbed and just keep on figthing as if nothing has even touched them. Pretty lame. Credibility near zero.More bad: the leading actor hasnt got any charisma. He looks like a dork. And although there is one big, bad crime guy who was supposed to be the ultimate evil, but he wasnt impressing me either.I had hoped for a thrilling action packed gangster movie, but it was quite a bit of a dread to watch though...",
    "81": "I respect John Woo's decision to try to make a film with no dialog and the story to be expressed through his imagery rather than a script. The problem is, however, that his imagery is not strong enough to hold my attention for as long as the film demanded, and the film's plot was also paper thin.A lot of scenes come off as awkward, and unnatural because the characters should be talking, but for some inexplicable reason are not. I was starting to wonder if I had missed a scene where everybody gets shot in the neck, and not just the main character? It was ridiculous! Even when the wife is grieving with him and he goes all insane, throwing things and raging, she just stares at him and says nothing. Same with Kid Cudi's character. A lot of his screentime is just him staring at some photos or into a room without saying anything. Made the film almost unbearable to watch.The plot itself was ripped right out of Death Sentence, which was also a ripoff of Death Wish. I'm thinking Hollywood needs either better ideas, or better filmmakers. I don't mind a reused idea, but reuse it with purpose, to expand or better the previous product. Neither happened here.I also want to touch on how cheap the film looked. I'm not sure what the budget was, but surely they could have done better than this. The vast majority of the film is shot frenetically, so it's hard to see the action most of the time. It's also shot in some pretty low light, also making it difficult to see anything. The cinematography is what should draw people into this movie, considering that it probably didn't even have a script, and they couldn't even pull that off.Overall, this film is a mess and a shame. Such a simple premise and you make one of the most boring and irritating action films I think I've ever seen. I'm going to rewatch Face/Off to make me forget this film ever happened.0.5 shots in the neck out of 5.",
    "82": "Hated this film, most tedious action movie ever. It oversells the opening credits death of his son. While I understand it's the crux of the motivation, we get 30 minutes of his suffering before he decides to do a thing. Feels emotionally manipulative, wringing every last drop of milk from the tragedy to the point where it can't be called a fun action film in the least. The entire film is dialogue free, which works for him since he loses his voice, but becomes a big, dumb gimmick as every character in the film is given an excuse not to speak. One is gagged, one cries and texts the entire film, one is simply quiet and stoic and the rest grunt and groan to fill the gaping void. So finally, after a long cliched montage of him body building and gun training (and why he needs to be extra ripped I don't understand, but I'll buy it). He has a year to plan the perfect revenge and what does he do? Drives up, makes a lot of noise, makes every mistake imaginable & is constantly getting beat up and luck saves him every single time. Bad guys aim for his bullet proof vest over and over again, they give him long cool looks instead of just shooting him as he loudly makes himself an eye sore in every situation, never using even the smallest amount of stealth. He decides not to shoot a woman who just unambiguously just shot at him to kill him, which obviously doesn't go well for him. He tells the bad guys he's coming for him and is surprised that they best him. The lead bad guy decides to dance with his girl for like 10 minutes in slow motion as he is killing all his guys in what is possibly the most over decorated art direction ever in a movie... his lair looks like a groovy Los Angeles art installation or something meow wolf would dream up, hardly a gang member's decorating style. He sees his son in things and plays with his toys over and over stopping the action in its tracks. And finally, why are all the gang members cliches from 1990's movies? Why are they squatting and squaring off in abandoned ruins of buildings? Don't they have anywhere better to be? This movie was a boring, ridiculous, mess. John Woo tried his best to make it interesting visually, but the hyper style that worked in films like Face/Off never stops and makes it feel even more dramatically over the top.",
    "83": "I saw this movie for free and still wish I had not.Every trailer that I saw for this movie alluded to this being an action packed revenge saga. However, you get a taste of action within the first 7 minutes or so and then you have to wait approximately 60 minutes for your next dose and even then, during the last half-hour, you get maybe 15 minutes of action. So, out of 104 minutes you get 22 minutes of action.I do not like being lied to about the type of movie I am going to see and you probably would not like that either so I am trying to help you out here. What I would like to see is this movies gross drop off of a clip next weekend because of their deceptive practices.The soundtrack was garbage and forgetable (those songs I do remember were trash and those I don't ... well I guess I forgot).You want to know what else is forgetable? The antagonist. The detective. The wife. The son. Heck, this whole film is forgetable.",
    "84": "John Woo is a filmmaker I admittedly haven't seen a tonne of work from, but he undeniably has a vision for action sequences. That is what he is known for and he has stuck to that throughout most of his career in the business. Face/Off and Hard Boiled are awesome action films, so if I ever get the chance, I'll check out his latest. Well, Silent Night is his latest American effort and I must say, he hasn't lost his touch with action. With that said though, it was just okay overall. It has a lot of promise and some great ideas, but something bogged it down for me. Here are my thoughts.After a gang accidentally kills the son of a couple just trying to live a happy life, the husband, Godlock (Joel Kinnaman) decides to go after them. He ends up shot in the neck, preventing him from ever speaking a word again. His mission then becomes to train his body to take on this gang and kill them all. The unique aspect of this film is the fact that it is told entirely without dialogue. Not a single one of the characters speaks one word. I enjoyed that aspect, but I do wish it was utilized more than just having nobody speak. Nothing was interesting past the point of just not having him talk. It was clear that Woo just wanted to focus on the action and that was worth the price of admission.There wasn't a lot of originality in terms of the action set pieces, but it was all very well-choreographed. From a standout fight that takes place in a house, to a great stairwell scene, the action held my attention. With that said, the good aspects of this film are bogged down by the sappy nature of the backstory. The way his past with his child is presented is kind of cheesy at first and there is a specific moment towards the end of the film that almost made me chuckle when it was clear the film was trying to be very emotional. The schmaltz of it all overtook the film and ruined a few moments.Joel Kinnaman is an actor I like very much and his performance here is quite solid, but I'm not sure he was given enough to do, other than either be incredibly angry or sad. It's a very thin story and screenplay and the final product shows that. Still, if you enjoy action, there is enough here to satisfy viewers. The absent dialogue is a great idea, but this type of film needed some in my opinion. Silent Night is a little too cheesy at times, but I still think it's worth a watch if you are already interested. Now playing in theatres, there are worse options to watch than this one.",
    "85": "There is no dialog in this movie. Zero. Not an intelligible word in the entire film and what a waste because Joel Kinnaman is a wonderful actor. This is where the pretentiousness of the creators of this movie shine through.\"Hey, let's make a movie where our lead character doesn't speak\"\"Ok, that sound really interesting, but everyone else speaks, right ?\"\"NO! That's the hook...there's NO DIALOG in the entire film. Even when other characters who are able to speak and you would expect them to, we're not going to have them talk EITHER!\"\"But won't that be boring for the audi-\"\"And I know, we'll set it at Christmas, but in a place that has no snow, because who wants to film in snow?... And, get this...we'll call it Silent Night...get it?..Silent...because people don't speak but everyone will think it's related to Christmas\"",
    "86": "Silent Night, the latest cinematic offering from acclaimed director John Woo, delivers a powerful and poignant tale of love, loss, and the lengths one will go to protect their family. Set during the holiday season, the film follows a grieving father's quest for revenge after his son is tragically killed in a gang-related shooting.Joel Kinnaman delivers a powerful and nuanced performance as the grieving father, Brian, who is determined to avenge his son's death. His portrayal of a man consumed by grief and anger is both raw and captivating. Catalina Sandino Moreno is equally impressive as Brian's wife, Saya, who struggles to keep their family together in the face of tragedy.Silent Night's unique storytelling method, which features little to no dialogue, is a bold and daring choice that pays off in spades. The film's visual language is rich and evocative, with each frame brimming with emotion and meaning. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and thrilling, with Woo's signature flair for cinematic spectacle on full display.What truly sets Silent Night apart, however, is its emotional core. At its heart, the film is a story about the power of love and the lengths we will go to protect those we hold dear. It is a poignant and moving exploration of grief and the human condition, one that will stay with you long after the credits roll.In conclusion, Silent Night is a must-see film that offers a fresh and unique take on the revenge thriller genre. With its stunning visuals, powerful performances, and heartfelt storytelling, it is a cinematic experience that is not to be missed.",
    "87": "John Woo's Violent, Silent Night is a Bold Experiment That Works. While John Woo's new film, which hits theaters December 1st, has many elements that embody the reasons international action film fans idolize him, it has one character trait that is distinct from other Woo films. In fact, it is unique from all modern, full length movies. That feature is that the film has no dialogue. When I use the phrase \"no dialogue\" it is not hyperbolic to mean limited dialogue. There is, literally, no dialogue, at all.While this bold cinematic experiment could have been disastrous, it was not. In fact, it is critical to the film's appeal. This unique perspective, actually, elevates this film to a higher art form, without ever losing the raw grit and violent, action thrills that are at its core. The film's success lies in the fact that it is so well made, and the acting is so thoughtfully constructed, that the audience never longs for what does not even seem to be missing-spoken words. After viewing this one I had to remind myself that there was no dialogue. That is a tribute to the solid storytelling throughout Silent Night.Joel Kinnaman stars in, and does much of the heavy lifting, in this one. Kinnaman, a relative unknown to American movie audiences, is the fulcrum around which the entire weight of the film rests. His stellar ability to solidly convey to the audience his angst and despair over the murder of his son, and his laser pointed focus in avenging his death without words is what propels the film from an ordinary action film to an extraordinary one. This is a solid performance that happens to be in an action film, and not in spite of it.Catalina Sandino Moreno does an equally powerful job balancing the emotions of being the mother of a murdered son, who can not seem to break through the forcefield which is surrounding her husband's emotional descent. Moreno is the heart of the film, for sure.John Woo is known for his masterful Direction of action sequences. His, The Killer (1989), is considered one of the best action films of the 20th Century. This film builds on his distinguished body of work with jaw dropping vehicular chase scenes, chaotic shootouts, and visceral hand to hand exchanges. These are filmed with magnetic precision, and the elimination of shaky-cam effects, leading to a riveting result.While the film has the traditional martial arts theme of revenge, Kinnaman's lack of the conventional training of John Wick, Taken's Bryan Miller, and Nobody's Hutch Mansell is an asset to the film. His attempt to elevate his physical body and fighting skills to be able to obliterate his enemies is part of the film's brutal realism. This one is extremely violent, but it is all part of the roller coaster ride. He is a man driven by a singular cause, and we feel his pain.The entire supporting cast here does an admirable job of telling their part of the story. They are very good. The villains are, certainly, a little over the top here, but that makes their demise so much more satisfying.Marco Beltrani's musical score is as much a character in the film as any member of the cast. Music in movies is an important element of the storytelling; however, not all scores have the same level of importance. Perhaps, because of the lack of dialogue here, the score is vital and it does its job effectively.The real question on my mind as I left the NYC screening was, \"Like Die Hard, will people be debating whether Silent Night is, actually, a Christmas movie for years to come.\" While I am not sure of the answer to that question, I do know that John Woo's, Silent Night, is a winner. This Lionsgate release is greater than the sum of its parts. It is one of the best action films of the year, and I highly recommend it.",
    "88": "John Woo makes it look so easy that you pounder why so many people get it wrong. With less than a paragraph being uttered in this movie Woo got to express Action and drama and it was excellent.This movie says something about Joel Kinnaman's skill as an actor perfectly pulling off the role of a grieving father thirsty for revenge without having to use words to tell you that's what's going on.Also tells you something about Kid Cudi's talent as a thespian. He was on point.Very refreshing watching a movie that relies so heavy on visuals after all, I went to see a movie. If i wanted to listen to a story the internet is filled with podcast to do that.Welcome back John Woo!!!",
    "89": "Painfully stupid, albeit fitting for the time we're living in.I can almost hear the original pitch. This movie has a GIMMICK. Almost no one speaks a word of dialogue through the entire film. Does it work? NOPE. NOT AT ALL. Because film makers believe the audience is incredibly stupid, now more than ever. And without character motivations carefully explained through words all that is left to do is make every single action that appears on screen cartoonish beyond belief. I kid you not, what appears on screen in this film also works as a perfect parody of modern action movies. This film can be hilarious if you choose to view it from that perspective. I laughed out loud a lot.I am giving it 3 stars because it is filmed competently. Visually appealing, well edited, well choreographed action. But without believable situations and characters to care about it all falls flat.And, for the love of all things good, WIND UP MUSIC BOXES MUST BE BANNED FROM CINEMA FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.",
    "90": "Silent Night is a new action film directed by John Woo, director of Broken Arrow and Face/Off.When a father (Joel Kinnaman) and his son accidentally become victims of a criminal gang shooting on Christmas Eve, the son is affected. The father goes after the criminals, but is also shot and his vocal cords are activated.He can no longer talk, but he wants revenge. So he begins to train himself to take impossible Christmas revenge on the gang members who took his son and his voice away.With Silent Night, John Woo makes a directorial comeback after 20 years, because he has no longer controlled American action films since his 2003 film Paycheck. John Woo has often made his private action films unique in special ways. He now tries to do the same again by using almost no real dialogue in this film, apart from some background dialogue from music and news radio.Joel Kinnaman has to work more with facial expressions and body postures to act. He does this well, but if there had been a little more dialogue at the beginning of the film, the story could have been a bit clearer. Due to the lack of speech, the film can sometimes remain unclear. Catalina Sandino Moreno plays his wife and mother of the child who died. She knows how to portray a good, supporting role. Unfortunately, she fades into the background halfway through the film, during the father's revenge campaign. Kid Cudi plays a cop in the film who tries to investigate the attack on the father and son, but he still comes across as more in another film. If they had left his character out of the movie, the movie could have been a bit shorter and clearer.The story remains a standard revenge action film, in which characters, for personal reasons, want to take revenge on people who have harmed or taken something away from them. This film is somewhat reminiscent of John Wick's Deadpool, only with less humor or similar action.There are entertaining action scenes in this film, but unfortunately they are not that special and not at all for a Jon Woo action comeback. The action scenes do have some creative moments with good visual effects. Unfortunately, not all of the effects even look significant. Some explosions seem less realistic. The blood that characters get during the action scenes also sometimes looks more like fake CGI blood than it looks real.",
    "91": "Can you make an awesome Gun-Fu flick but have nobody talk? Absolutely. And who else to do it but the legendary Hong Kong Action Guru John Woo. I went into the film blind, and oddly enough I had watched John Woo's magnum opus, Hard Boiled, for the millionth time about a week ago and while thematically, it is significantly different, I still liked it. I grew up as a child watching the relentless Hong Kong classics on VHS in the 90's, and while some may soon be saying it didn't reach those heights. I don't think it was supposed to it.This was a quite interesting experiment of combining character study and an explosive Gun-Fu action flick. I must say, it worked much better than I anticipated it would. This was a wholly unique movie in a sea of the same old boring action movies (insert 500 movies in the last 5 years). In fact, the trailers before the film were literally the stale Jason Statham, solo action hero BS that this film amazing breaks free from to provide a fun and special experience. The action was not quite Hard Boiled extremes, but it was well choreographed. The acting was good enough to convey a story with no words. Thumbs up, fun movie for a change, the movie landscape seems to be changing.People should also remember how frequently John Woo has commented on many of things I have a feeling younger folks, or folks new to his work, will soon complain about. He acknowledges that nobody reloads their weapons because it \"interrupts the flow of the action\", the enemy couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat (people shooting 2 feet away from each other and hitting nothing). There needs to be a suspension of disbelief for Woo films, and there have been for decades, just relax, and enjoy the violence.While I am getting sick of CGI car accidents (I saw that in another different movie very recently but can't remember), and the digital blood and wish there would be a return to the classic use of practical effects. I miss the 90's and all its paper/debris flying, squib orgies, and people actually hitting each other. But this film does have the classic practical effects to a large degree and while the digital effects would be my only complaint. I REALLY liked this and would recommend.",
    "92": "As a John Woo fan I really thought this was going to be his comeback. The concept was so cool, and the trailer looked so good. I genuinely felt like this had so much potential and I was so excited to see it realized. I kept imagine how intense sequences of pure action must be without any interruption of dialogue. I kept imagining the unique focus on the visuals and sounds to replace the work of the dialogue. Mr. Robot pulled off a thrilling episode with no dialogue, so surely this movie could've too. Truly there was so much that could've been done and this would've been a classic. Unfortunately that trailer literally showed the best moments, and not much was done with the concept.All they really had to do was follow the John Wick blueprint but focus more on the visual storytelling and give it a unique angle with the mute protagonist on top of the lack of dialogue that could've made this movie so much more tense. Unfortunately, the lack of dialogue detracts from the characterization and feels forced in many scenes. I feel like there could've been a lot more done with the protagonist who's very well performed, but not well written. I question his willingness to go on shooting sprees when his son was killed by a stray bullet. There is nothing really done with the protagonist suddenly becoming mute, and the drama with his wife has no real development. The mandatory set up for the emotional beats to hit are executed in such a boring and cliche way and takes up what feels like half the film. Every scene with the son felt so repetitive, and like it was begging you to care with the music, but I really didn't. It almost became cheesy, especially at the end. There's this cop character that's just... there, I guess. There's no personality given to the villains except it keeps cutting to the main villain drugging and shagging this random girl...When we finally get to the action John Woo does deliver, but it's not his best work, and doesn't redeem such a thin story. There's moments of Woo's brilliance shining through what are mostly just pretty good action sequences by today's standards. A lot of the car scenes weren't the best either. The action has its moments and the visuals are often cool, but even then there are some odd directorial choices like overuse of slow-mo and some odd editing choices. I always just felt like there's this great action scene coming, and some parts were, but other parts were off. What's worse is that much of the action feels completely unbelievable and just dumb with the protagonist, of course, getting along through luck and pure incompetence from the villains. The last 2 confrontations in this movie are what really tanked it for me to call it bad. It's just plain ridiculous and unsatisfying how they unfold. Genuinely feels like some AI choreography, unreal, and it's so stupid character wise.With all this being said I still mostly enjoyed the movie thanks to some good action and visuals, but I felt like it was more due to the goodwill I have for John Woo, like I owe him for his older awesome films. This was overall a disappointing film and such a waste of the concept. I hope someone else tries something like this again and does better. I don't want to be too hard on Mr. Woo though. Please John Woo, you are better than this, and we still love you!(4/10)",
    "93": "First and foremost, this movie will not be for everyone simply because it is mostly dialogue-free. Truly silent, minus a few bits of radio chatter and music with action sound effects. This is what sets it apart from other revenge flicks, though, and part of the reason why it is fresh, but also a little problematic. It has to get to the action as quickly as it can, but needs to fill the run time, so has a shaky first half, albeit a very rewarding second half.Many movies, especially from the past 10 years, start twenty minutes later than movies used to begin. Character building is lost because we are thrown into the action. For this to truly work, on a quick popcorn movie, the film would have to be just over an hour. Since we are over that theoretical minimum of 90 minutes, there's a chunk of slow-moving scenes at the start. We get hit over the head with the reasoning behind the vengeance, and it's done in a slow, no dialogue way. Once you get past this, then you can settle in for some very good action scenes! Luckily these action scenes are rewarding enough to deal with a frustratingly unlikeable hero and a shallow supporting cast.I could definitely see rewatching this, but only for the practical action that is very well directed. Some people may not get far enough into the movie appreciate some John Woo thrills, but if you give it 30 minutes (or chapter skips), then it's very worth your time.",
    "94": "Whoever they had put the trailer together for this movie is who they should had make this movie because the trailer is way more interesting.This movie is a huge disappointment from beginning to end. Nothing in this movie makes sense and nobody talks at all in this movie.The movie starts off strong but immediately looses steam after the first 10 minutes. For the next 30-40 minutes the main character walks around the house drinking all day and looking up fighting videos on YouTube so that he can train to take on all the baddies.The next half of the movie is just straight up stupid action sequences that make no sense and are so sloppy. I wanted to like them and I really tried but the first half of the movie drained everything from me out of pure boredom that I could not get back in it.The ending of the movie is also pathetic and just mind blowing how a legendary director put this out.Just save your money and stay far away from this movie. Watch Violent Night instead if you want a good anti holiday action movie.I saw this movie for free and it still was not even worth it.",
    "95": "I went into this totally blind, I had no idea that there was a gimmick. After the initial \"oh I get it\" wore off, this was painful to get through. It's a typical John Woo movie, in fact it's The Punisher, but with no dialogue. I mean I never thought I'd be pleading for John Woo of all people to write a little dialogue but here we are. I guess I can give him credit for attempting to do something new, but that's the problem; he didn't. Sure the no dialogue thing is different, but it was still a typical John Woo shoot 'em up. I found myself laughing out loud at a few points because of the way he chose to execute something without saying anything, it felt very silly during very serious moments. If you're going to go silent, you have to at least give the audience something more clever than a predictable action movie. He also used a couple of cop-outs, like text messages to replace the dialogue.I guess watch it if you're curious so you can say you did. It's a unique film, but it's also pretty forgettable.",

    "97": "LIKES:Fast Paced Mostly:\n-The movie does little to doctor up the story, instead jumping into the meat of what this movie is about: Revenge Self Induced.-The movie gets to the three stages rapidly, trying to pack the most of the adrenaline into the 100 minutes and do it with the splendor Woo likes to bring.-And if that's what you want... this is an A+, as the pace gives you enough to piece things together, without getting stuck in the meander of stuffy dialogue and cliché moments.The Emotion\n-Despite saying little to no words, Silent Night conveys the turmoil of loss extraordinarily well and the emotions of anger and seeking self-justice.-Each scene has this amazing etiquette to it, the angles of the shot, the music/sound editing, and the conveyance of the facial expression speak it all\n-And as the night proceeds, the movie only further helps with that purging, watching as each blast starts to convey a different set of character meets that just tell a narrative that has some heft to it.-And some of the shots for nonviolent handling, powerful works of cinema that do so little to do so much.Camerawork:\n-I've already said it makes good of the emotion, but there is some other props to the work of our camera team accomplished with this film.-For one thing, it has a great visual element, this art that is very abstract, but yet direct, twisting it to being just that odd element that works to tell the narrative.-Training montages hold more than the 80s machoism, but hold fervor and character willpower. Build up to piecing together the plan holds Oceans like quality, but yet is simplistic and the visuals giving you that thousand word approach for efficiency.-And once the action starts, I can say it hits just about every box in terms of action, kills, carnage, and that justice driven shot that sums things up so well. All with stable camera work to give you the experience without the mess.The Action:\n-It's big, it's bold, it's bloody, and it's the promise of the trailers.-Silent Night has moments that again show how a good director makes those moments that make you say expletives or at least oh Wow.-Gun play, knife work, and some fisticuffs fly as the savagery of the movie unleashes into a fight that has edge, dynamics, and stakes that are exciting to see. Fun moves that blend modern day with video game style moves, a sort of gang busting cowboy at times.-Combined with that emotional cinematography, it helps elevate the fight past the usual bland punches that most action movies take when they aren't action.-Fantastic and the heart of the movie, Silent Night's third act is exactly the climactic experience you want to the buildup that this movie was designing. Loved it.-And even more impressive, is that unlike some action heroes, you take damage you keep it, only further adding that realistic measure to give a little more excitement to the film.-It misses few beats, and the character tale through the violence... works on some level that pulls it all together.DISLIKES:The Story Is Meh\n-There is emotion, and there is relevance, but that's about all this simplistic tale has to go for it.-Where John Wick accomplishes this to a better degree, Silent Night is more of a visual direction story to live through with little thought, which may work for those wanting adrenaline.-Yet the directions they chose in the beginning could have used a little more, some engaging characters, some discussions, something to help add that spark for inclusion.-Fortunately the action helps distract from this but still there was more that could have been done for me.The opening is a tad slow and repetitive:\n-You'll get the vision of grief, remorse, and trauma, but perhaps a tad too much for my liking.-Seeing these moments of mourning start out fine, but they get very lengthy, see it happen a lot for nearly one hour and at times get a tad creepy.-Again, it's a bold artistic statement, but this added a lot of bloating at the beginning, and could have been done a little less time manner to improve in my ability.-Or you know integrated in a manner that didn't get too odd or distracting.Character Integration:\n-It's really a story about the silent protagonist alone, and that works, but for the fact of integrating Kid Cudi into the mix and modeling him a key player\n-Silent Night kind of stinks in terms of building up most of the characters, suing only the attitude, the shots, and some simple story elements to make it work. You have little attachment to them, even the mom and that was a shame given the potential.-It could have used more planning and magic, but again, for most it won't be an issue when you are in the midst of gun play.The Violence:\n-Another warning than dislike, the violence is again to the level where sensitive beings need to stay away.-It's gory and realistic, gun shots and knife wounds deep and close up to unleash the true injury that comes with it.-Sure, there is excitement, but its vicious, paints the walls with red saturation, and can be very disturbing if you aren't prepared.-A tad excessive? Yeah, near the end especially, but still within reason for most members going to see this film.THE VERDICT:\n-Silent Night is pretty much a unique twist on a Christmas action film, that holds Woo's style with cinema making and the typical adrenaline fuel of the genre. A pace that is quick, this movie uses the bare minimum to tell the story and get into the motivational montages of fighting and training to get you into the film. It's simplicity is both genius and limiting, but for the most part this action film is ready to unleash madness with strong visuals, great choreography, and a realistic edge that helps keeps things engaging. Such fight scenes prove the right directors can still make good pieces in terms of action stunts, fighting, and the splendor that they can be. However, the movie lacks a fleshed out story, it lacks character usage, and is really just a spectacle of violence that though fulfilling is not the most engaging piece to come to mind. I had fun with it, but there are still better pieces that balance both story and the flair of action. It certainly delivers on the element of the trailers, but again caution to those sensitive to violence and trauma being repeated a tad too much. Thus, my scores are:Action: 7.5-8.0\nMovie overall: 6.0.",
    "98": "Well, I do like what John Woo did different by making an action movie with ZERO dialogue and nice cinemtography, this movie was awful. I am not someone who expects movies to be realistic. Because lets face it, if that were true, I would never see 99% of the movies that have been made. My mom will tell you i usually like bad movies. But i still feel that main plot points of a movie need to make some sense. And I just found too many things in this movie that didn't.First, I will start off with the fact that these career gang members have the accuracy of a two-year-old with a Nerf gun. In the beginning of the film, there is a scene, that you can see in the trailer, that involves two rival gangs driving in cars and shooting at each other. Despite the fact that these cars are within 2 feet of each other and all of these big bad guys have automatic weapons, neither side hits each other for miles. Then, in the last act of the movie that is the big shootout in the building, again that you can see in the movie's trailer, these lifetime criminals run up on the guy and don't get a bullet off before this homebody dad shoots them? You have got to be kidding me! Harry Potter had better accuracy in \"Guns Akimbo\".My other problem is with the main character himself. The movie plays up how he spends nine months preparing to exact revenge and kill all the gang members with fight training from youtube, target practice and working out. Yet the first fight he gets in he gets his ass kicked horribly. If I were him, I would get all the money back I paid for the gun club because the training did absolutely nothing. The only reason he can kill any of them is because the gang members have the accuracy of a magic eight ball. Joel is a scrawny dad and yet this tough gang can't kill him? He's not John Wick. And the only thing that has been on his mind all this time is revenge. How come whenever he killed somebody he looked upset about it?Lastly, while I do get that emotion plays a big part in this movie because there is no dialogue, those scenes were repetitive and very long. Half of them were unnecessary and just a drag.The plot line to this movie is not unique at all. In fact, it was like a Tubi version of Death Wish, The Punisher, Death Sentence, etc.. That combined with the ridiculous so-called gang members is why I dislike and was very disappointed in this film.",
    "99": "John Woo is a great director of action and he proves that with Silent Night. Fists and bullets fly all over the place in this picture. On top of that the film cleverly operates almost like a silent movie. The only voices heard are on radios or TV, there is no dialogue. This conceit is pulled off effortlessly.But with that all said, I still found this movie to be tedious. Maybe it's my old age speaking but the days when I can watch a film where one man can shoot dozen upon dozen of people while they some how manage to miss him are over. Every first shot this man makes hits his target but almost every bit of returned fire manages to go nowhere near him. Add to this our hero knowing where to put up surveillance for LA' s Most Wanted but for some reason the cops don't is too stupid by half.Speaking of the bad guys, while I admit I'm no expert on street gangs I'm going to guess that when they doing their illegal business in their HQ it's not with the windows wide open where anybody can look in.This is a stupid movie. But hey, sometimes, a stupid movie can be fun. But for me, Silent Night was not fun.",
    "100": "John Woo, a renowned director, has been absent from American cinema for 20 years, but his influence remains evident. His films, such as Bullet Train and John Wick, are heavily influenced by Woo's operatic style. As the action movie industry continues to boom, Woo is expected to return to reclaim his throne with his revenge thriller Silent Night. The film serves as a warm-up for the lead character, Godlock, who trains to transform from a milquetoast family man to a ruthless killer. The story takes place in a post-Taken world, similar to 1974's Death Wish, where fathers overcome trauma by tracking down and punishing those responsible. Silent Night is virtually dialogue-free, starting and ending at Christmastime, and serves as a challenge for both Woo as a filmmaker and for the audience. The film serves as a competent exercise rather than a victory lap, serving as a warm-up for the film's future. Kinnaman's father is rendered mute after being shot in the throat, requiring limited facial expressions to convey his grief and determination. The films are structured like video games, racing from one end-of-level-boss to the next, leaving the film largely on Woo Woo's shoulders. Woo's stylistic choices range from ingenious to ugly, and his love of all-consuming melodrama only emerges in flashes. The film's structure is often more entertaining to watch the prep than the carnage that follows, as it allows for a more involving journey than usual. The film's aesthetic prowess needs to wow us enough to make all other markers meaningless, and Woo's stylistic choices range from ingenious to ugly. John Woo's \"Silent Night\" is a predictable revenge thriller set during Christmas. \"Silent Night\" is a film that communicates innocence through the hero carrying a wind-up toy that still plays its plaintive melody. The film's simplicity and simplicity often resemble passages from the Old Testament or epics. The director, John Woo, is a virtuoso in the role, and the film's success relies on the filmmakers not being afraid to push beyond what's considered good judgment or taste. Some of the greatest operas and pop songs take this risk, pushing beyond what's considered good taste without fear of offense or embarrassing themselves. By pushing beyond rational objections, the film overcomes any rational objections and opens up a magnificent, rare, and sublime feeling. Woo's performance is a virtuoso in this music-driven film. The film, directed by Woo, is one of his best and one of the most deliriously cinematic of the year. The story follows a couple (Joel Kinnaman and Catalina Sandino Moreno) who lose their son to a stray bullet after rival gang members shoot at each other. The title is unrelated to the holiday carol, but it's a silent movie with sound, showcasing the idea that the telling matters more than the tale.",
    "101": "Makes you realize just how economically John Wick used its runtime: about two-thirds of this is preparing for the action, then getting to the action and being slightly disappointed by it. Don't get me wrong, it still outshines a lot of its contemporaries - but that's a low bar to clear. The viscerality is there, but it's no The Raid; the vehicle combat is no Fury Road; the stairway oner is no Atomic Blonde; and I could keep going. Forgive the comparative nature of the analysis, but this does nothing we haven't seen before (outside of the dialogueless gimmick that frankly was a terrible decision) which would be fine if the supposed 'master of action' actually lived up to his name here. I have yet to properly dive into Woo's filmography, so I hope Silent Night ends up a stain on an otherwise perfectly clean blanket.Cherry on top is the conservative fantasy of a man going on his sigma male grind, thereby losing any meaningful human connection, but ultimately it's all worth it because he went on a rampage against a bunch of gang members. Felt very sad indeed when they played stock sound effects of a kid laughing during all the flashbacks.",
    "102": "\"Kill them all.\" Brian (Joel Kinneman)John Woo's reputation for stylized violence is well deserved if only for his new revenge thriller, Silent Night. His slow motion mixed with a nervously moving camera, piercing closeups, stunning wounds, and imaginative car chases that seem real are just a few of his signature shots. His Cantonese hits like The Killer and Hard Boiled established him as an auteur of blood violence par excellence. That he is not reluctant to be sentimental gives most of his thrillers an extra measure of charm in the presence of mayhem.Woo's Hollywood masterpieces like Face /Off and Mission Impossible II remind his devotees how 20 years have not diminished his ability to carry off astonishing stunts and car chases better than Steve McQueen's. His bird motif, which he has used before with white doves, adds an artistic flare not usual with bloodbaths.In this new thriller with almost no dialogue (maybe 10 swear words is all I could hear), Woo outstrips Wick and Equalizer for profound anger with a need for revenge propelling Brian ( Joel Kinnaman), shot in the throat by a gang that killed his son (Anthony Giulietti), is now a mute father who has lost his only child to that stray gangland bullet. \"Kill them all\" he writes on his calendar for the next anniversary, Christmas Eve.Neither he nor Woo needs words; the silence is bracing and ominous, and I'm a word guy with an insatiable appetite for good dialogue-- not needed here. His pans smoothly bring back a happy family life, sequences that even I welcomed in place of sentimental word tripe too often softening traditional revenge films.Woo is smart enough to enlist our sympathy with a child born to melt the audience and a wife/mother (Catalina Sandino Moreno) so engaging and loving as to make the body count (less than Wick but more than Equalizer) seem acceptable and desirable. Words? Not needed.Few other revenge films have such a hard-nosed ending as well. Woo courts the dismay of fellow violent filmmakers by engaging our sympathy for the bereaved parents and nothing for any of the villains, even a young woman wielding a machine gun.Although David Fincher's recent The Killer shows how intense-but- minimalist action can be powerful, Woo wins the revenge race with barely a word.",
    "103": "A drive-by shooting just before christmas, ends up with Brian losing his son and even getting shot in his throat, losing his voice. It becomes yet another open case, with the gang remaining untouched. Surviving the ordeal, takes a toll on Brian and Saya, as he gets distant from her by drinking and sulking over the loss. Soon, he realizes that seeking revenge is the way to honour his son and starts training as well as researching about the gang. He marks the date, exactly 1 year from the incident, to kill them all. How Brian succeeds in executing his mission forms the explosive final act.John Woo is finally back to Hollywood and it was indeed a fun comeback. The entire gimmick behind minimal dialogues, none for Brian as well as the baddies works for an extent to make the treatment unique. The narrative is as predictable as it can get and it's a straight forward revenge story. There is no action during the first and second act, completely focusing on grieving and prepping to exact the revenge. It is the final act that thoroughly pays off with non stop action. Though the film doesn't have anything to standout wrt writing, John Woo makes up for it with his direction.",
    "104": "John Woo may have done one or good movies, but this is just horrible. Never have I ever watched a movie trailer and get so pumped to watch a movie that turned out to be this level of garbage.Plot convenience has been elevated to a whole new level, to the point of being absurd and ridiculous. Acting is very, VERY bad, and here's the kicker, it's NOT because of the actors, it becomes very obvious that the actors - who by the way have almost ZERO lines of dialog for some reason - are INSTRUCTED by the director to express themselves by facial expression and body language, in the most idiotic possible manner.The action scenes are going to look stupid to anyone who knows anything about guns, cars, or fighting. Cars are bullet proof, automatic weapons fire 300 rounds without changing a magazine, but for some reason the producers decided to make some of the bad guys basically bullet proof.This kind of movie practically REQUIRES a stoic hero, but the director probably wanted to make him more \"human\" and instead turned him into an idiot.If like me you've watched the trailer and thought this was going to be a good movie, you can still avoid wasting 1h45m of your precious time and spare yourself from the cringe and annoyance, fair warning.",
    "105": "The plot heavily reminds me of Peppermint, where a woman basically did the same stuff. Family gets killed, police don't do anything, she disappears off to train herself then comes back to go on an insane killing spree. It's literally the plot. Gangs were even Latino.The action scenes were overdramatized so that was fun. However, I wish they got shot more often, there was stormtrooper aiming going on. But fights get better later on. I loved how bloody it was yet it wasn't gruesome enough to make you uncomfortable unless you're squeamish.The movie does go out of its way to spend time building this would and showcasing how much gang related stuff is going on. I kinda loved that no word was spoken for a good chunk of the start. There were some small issues, like why'd you leave your car unlocked, windows down in a neighborhood with high crime?Loved that the fights seemed real later on, the hand to hand combat scenes better than the shoot outs at the start. The movie starts out slow, but it's building up to what you'd anticipate is an action packed third act. And my god is it worth the wait, kinda. I wasn't entirely blown away, still felt like it took too long to get there. And the fact that it's a Peppermint(2018) copycat didn't impress me so much.",
    "106": "From the spectacular nothingness of the characters to the simplistic plot that still manages to produce holes bigger than any bullet in the movie itself, from tired movie tropes like generic flashbacks and toy box sadness to a gimmick that does more damage than good - SILENT NIGHT is truly something to behold.The writing is as naive and incompetent as the direction, and unbelievably, I also have to include the action, especially because it's a John Woo film which has to be held to his own, once fantastic standards. CGI cars, bad CGI blood, a lot of \"invisible\" cuts. From people not being able to hit anything with automatic weapons just metres away from each other to people not being able to see a huge forklift standing in their way - it's all hilarious if you can see this as a comedy. But the sheer pretentiousness of the no dialogue gimmick and the overall overly heavy tonality sadly spoil the fun, leaving you clueless whatever happened to one of action cinema's greatest directors.No character has any backstory, personality, meaning. It's all nothing. As a consequence, you will probably fail to have any empathy and enthusiasm for the protagonist's progress. The only thing that made me feel anything was seeing Kid Cudi's incredibly gross fingernails.Man, I'm afraid John Woo lost it for good. Where there was once delightfully absurd, visionary, fast-paced, over-the-top action and mastery of bending time and space, now only absurdity remains.",
    "107": "During Christmas, family man Brian Godlock (Joel Kinnaman) loses his son Taylor (Anthony Giulietti) as the result of stray gunfire during a gang war. Brian is left mute when gang leader Playa (Harold Torres) shoots him in the throat when Brian tries to confront them very much leaving him as he and his wife Soya (Catalina Sandino Morena) struggle to continue on in the wake of the tragedy. Eventually Brian spends the intervening months training and planning to take down the entire gang on Christmas Eve.Silent Night is the new action film from Hong Kong director John Woo and marks the director's first Western produced action film since 2003's Paycheck with Woo primarily focused on Wuxia films and historical epics in the intervening years (save for the exception of 2017's Manhunt). Produced entirely without dialogue and featuring a more serious take on the material than Woo is traditionally known for, Silent Night won't quite be the revisit to the Woo style of action that fans know from A Better Tomorrow 1+2, Hardboiled, or Face/Off, but as a technical exercise it's exhilarating and well made.To start off, Silent Night is undeniably impressive as an exercise in pure visual storytelling. While Silent Night's premise and script feature many of the hallmarks of the tried-and-true vigilante subgenre of action films, the style and craft that comes from conveying the story and emotions through pantomime is brutally effective and much of the credit can be placed on Joel Kinnaman whose performance is as painful as it is intense. Despite being an action film, Silent Night takes its time before we action begin the action proper and the first 40 minutes or so are mostly focused on Brian's breakdown that eventually leads to him rebuilding himself into a single-minded vehicle of vengeance. Silent Night has the distinction of featuring one of the best training/planning montages I can recall of recent memory and it's elevated by Joel Kinnaman's performance who radiates an intense energy that becomes terrifying in some cases. Once we get to the action, it's as brutal as it is well-staged as Woo plays off the fact Brian isn't trained in combat and there's quite a few times where he stumbles and makes mistakes and when the punches, shots, or stabs impact you feel them. Admittedly some parts of the movie could've been refined as despite Woo playing the material more grounded in comparison to his past work, some of Brian's flashback sequences are so over the top in how they're portrayed they feel like they'd be more at home in something like Face/Off rather than this more gritty film. The movie also features Scott Mescudi (aka Kid Cudi) as Detective Dennis Vassel and I didn't really understand why he was in the movie as he doesn't really serve much purpose except to showcase Woo's trademark \"duel wielding pistols\" that feels really out of place and like it was put in more as fan service than for any legitimate reason.Silent Night certainly delivers on brutally violent action spectacle with a heathy dosage of holiday iconography, but if you're expecting a traditional John Woo movie with an ironic Holiday backdrop you're not going to get that so clear your expectations of any comparisons to Hardboiled or Face/Off levels of over the top. If however you're looking for a solidly brutal and well-acted revenge thriller with well-staged action: here it is!",
    "108": "\"Silent Night\" is an attempt by John Woo to be poetic rather than his usual artistic action, and it fails.A man whose son was killed by a stray bullet during a gang car chase battle runs after them and is shot in the neck, losing his voice, and setting up the conceit: there is no dialogue in the entire movie (OK, yes, a couple very low words spoken by his wife). He falls apart then is galvanized into revenge, the usual plot.There is some artistic Woo action, and way too much flashback pushing his agony in your face.I grant you that it is dark and grim, with a message about society letting things happen that should be tamped down, so the only way to solve it is to \"Kill Them All.\" But that doesn't make a good movie.It does have great villains, though, which is one of my key criteria.",
    "109": "So where do i start with this one? Its basically John Wick but replace the dog by a child and add a twist that the character is muted due to his previous encounter with the peoples he will go after. Exept its nowhere as good as John Wick. On paper that sound for a cool action flick... but the movie sadly got its 3 strikes.First of all, this is a movie without dialogues minus a few voices on radio and a rare cellphone text lines. If this was made in Japan, you could had watch it in original language without english subtitles and still not have any problem understanding. They do try to create emotional connections trough physical acting and music but it just can't replace words for me. Not when everyone in the movie does it. And some situation make little sense due to the writer insisting on not having dialogues. It didn't felt natural.Second strike came in the fact that the movie despite being deprived of dialogues ... goes on for about an hour of \"plot\" and nothingburger. When i saw the trailer i was expecting some crazy action movie. If there had been a 20m max intro and then boom boom gunshots, explosions, whatever, it may had worked a bit better? But here i just kept looking at the time and it took about an hour until action kicked in.And finally the third strike, the action is not that special... Its good yes, but it ain't mindblowing or original. If you take something like John Wick 3 and 4, it tried to outdo the other movies everytime with cool set ups and concept. Here its basically your general gunshot and car chase without much that come out of the ordinary. A few slowmos that were cool but thats it. Plot armor also show its ugly head ... i guess the gang members are all former Storm Troopers.Overall in the vein of these John Wick type of action movies i saw much better ones like Extraction, Nobody, and various ones from Streaming services. This movie plaster John Woo's name everywhere because its recognizable, but if i didn't know he directed it, i would had assume its just another streaming service production with a modest budget.I wouldn't go as low as to see the movie was \"terrible\" or anything, its simply i expected a lot better and it disapointed me. I will surely not go trough the 1h of \"plot\" to get to that small action part at the end again.",
    "110": "Or maybe it isn't? No pun intended - and sort of the only dialog of the movie too. Only one spoken directly by one of the main characters that is. It is a bit weird to have everyone mostly staring and expressing every emotion by ... well way of looks.That said, John Woo wanted it that way and this movie really asks you to suspend your disbelief! It is not just the missing dialog (it is not a silent movie - it is anything but that - effects wise), but what happens .. as in the action and stunt department. How our \"hero\" acts and reacts to things.You are not supposed to hold it against him - don't try this at home of course. And while this is a tour de Force for Joel, you may wonder about the female role (his wife) in this. Not much to do - she does her best with the little she is supposed to be doing.The action is amazing (Woo adding car stunts to his vita - I reckon he hired a really good person for this - an expert so to speak). It's been a while since I saw a Woo movie - I remember there being melodrama involved. And after an action heavy beginning, we do slow down and have half an hour or more of ... well story time. Bit of time hopping (what happened before and all that) ... something that even though the actors try their best, might be the weak spot of the movie. Yes it is needed for motivational purposes and planting, seeding and all that ... still it may feel way too long.But the reward is around the corner ... in form of some very fine action scenes. Of course you cannot be squeamish! The movie has a high amount of violence and a lot of blood on display. Not Woos best, but a welcome back of sorts ... if you are into that form of thing ... some comical (accidental?) moments included ...",
    "111": "Why is this movie business want Joel Kinneman to be a thing? Why?! He has as much charm as skin rash.Here he plays a construction worker whose son is killed by a stray bullet from a gang war. The neighborhood they live in was once great until...yes, totally un-PC, Mexican gangs started to ruin it. Like most do.In his grief, he sets out to condition himself into a vigilante. The conceit here is that he doesn't say anything. Neither does anyone else, save a few whispers. This gimmick gets old fast. Especially when he walks into a police station and we expect someone to explain why there is no investigation on the dude who shot him and left him for dead. I mean, he was a witness to his own shooting. And it't not like the police didn't know where the gang boss was. Yeah, dumb.I suppose they were attempting to show a degenerated community much like \"RoboCop\" where the police are ineffective.The bones of this is clearly trying to make Kinneman something like...John Wick meets the Punisher. Down to the stupid duster jacket.This movie is so derivative of better movies and none show the essence of what was once great John Woo. There are glimpses, such as in \"The Killer\" where a guilt ridden gangster tries to atone for blinding a innocent bystander. Or guns akimbo. Or having a cop and a civilian go for gunplay. Somehow,. This felt EXHAUSTING. And not in a good way.I want to say Woo wanted a message here...somewhere but not necessarily sure what it is. This felt very cheap. Almost as if it were a faith based film ala \"Sound Of Freedom\"I digress.This movie is anemic, at best.",

Woo needs to change his position to stunt coordinator and not director..Dad's son dies, dad immediately tries to avenge son, dad gets his ass handed to him, dad lands in hospital for a lengthy visit.

Their son is killed. Brian chases them and gets himself shot. After a long hospitalization, he loses his voice and seeks revenge. While at the police station, he photographs detective Dennis Vassell (Kid Cudi)'s suspect list and suddenly, he has a hit list.Director John Woo is back in America. His last big budget Hollywood movie is probably Paycheck (2003). By no means, this is big budget, but Joel Kinnaman is a solid Hollywood actor. It's John Woo action with a simple story and a gimmick. That's probably his best cinematic move. Others have stolen his thunder since he first crashed into Hollywood, but he can still muster a good B-movie. That's what this is. It's got some fine action. The simple story works. He may not be the newest exotic flavor anymore, but he can still do his stuff.",
    "114": "Right, well of course it was nice to see John Woo return to direct a Hollywood movie. And naturally, I must admit that I was indeed harboring a certain level of expectations to his return to the US cinema. So how did he manage with \"Silent Night\"?Essentially well enough, I would say. Sure, the script and plot in \"Silent Night\", as written by Robert Archer Lynn, is a bit generic and linear. There wasn't really any twists or turns to the narrative throughout the course of the 104 minutes that the movie ran for, which sort of made \"Silent Night\" a bit generic and rather predictable.Sure, \"Silent Night\" is a watchable enough movie for what it turned out to be. But it wasn't exactly an the grand return to direct Hollywood movies that it could have been for director John Woo. Entertaining? Sure. Enjoyable? Sure? Outstanding? Not so much.The acting in \"Silent Night\" were good, but I have to say that leading actor Joel Kinnaman wasn't really given all that much to work with, since his character was deprived the ability to speak. So it felt like he was left with two options throughout the course of the movie; and that was either rage or self-pity. Not really the best of writing from Robert Archer Lynn here in terms of character depth and development.Of the entire cast ensemble in the movie, then I was only familiar with Joel Kinnaman.Now, with \"Silent Night\" being a John Woo movie, there is something you can count on. And that is a good amount of action and adrenaline-packed scenes. And true enough, John Woo certainly delivered here with \"Silent Night\". There was an abundance of action scenes, fight scenes, car chase scenes and such, as you would expect from a John Woo movie. And it looks good and it feels very well choreographed and executed. And that most certainly made the movie all the more enjoyable to sit through.And the ending of the movie was just a bit too sappy. It seemed like the writer was trying to add a level of sympathy for the Brian Godlock character with the audience. However, it was such a bizarre change of style to the movie, that is came off as being really campy and cheesy.If you enjoy John Woo movies, then you definitely should sit down to watch \"Silent Night\". And if you are unfamiliar with previous movies directed by John Woo, then you can very much still enjoy \"Silent Night\" for the action movie that it turned out to be.My rating of \"Silent Night\" lands on a six out of ten stars.",
    "115": "I think people will either love or hate the concept of no dialogue. I personally loved it. It's one of the more unique action movies I've seen in recent years. If it had dialogue, it wouldn't have been as memorable. The story is told visually, through strong acting, a fitting musical score and of course the impactful and violent action and John Woo's expert direction.The acting from Joel Kinnaman is top notch. He really conveys a lot of emotion with his scenes with out saying a word and you really feel for his character and the pain he is going through. The direction from John Woo is amazing, he proves why he is one of the best action directors of all time. The action is violent, and hard hitting and expertly crafted and shot. Story is simple and straightforward , something you've seen so many times in an action movie, which is why the no dialogue makes it unique.Overall, a future cult and Christmas action classic. One of the best of 2023 and will go down as one of the best in this decade. A unique, artful and surprisingly emotional and high impact action movie. A must watch for fans and glad I watched it in cinema.7.5/10.",

The wife, the detective, random strangers interacting Joel Kinnaman through words. Instead it is 'clever' shortcuts and text messages that fill the void of talking.The action is great. The standard underdog to hero journey.The beginning where the backstory gets established drags on a bit. And by bit I mean for a good chunk of the movie. Given that the film is nicely edited and using clever stand-ins instead of dialogue, I'm surprised they go with a heavy layer of backstory exposition for a huge chapter of the movie. That being said, it is not bad the execution.The law enforcement in this movie , let's just say you will have to suspend disbelief.The Christmas theme is a bit ridiculous in hindsight and doesn't really make sense. But in terms of shoehorning an action flick just in time for Christmas it seems to make sense.Joel Kinnaman is a fantastic actor, and is fun to watch.The second half reminded me of Dredd 2012. With all its bullets flying, seeking for justice, and ultimate conclusion.Overall I'd say give it a watch, it's not a bad movie for 2023. And it has the balls to do something different which one has to commend.",
    "117": "The title is somewhat misleading because the movie has sound. In fact, there are many sounds, sounds of bangs and booms, grunts and groans, stabbings and rippings, all of which you would expect from John Woo and this amazingly maudlin melodrama. Perhaps a technical Oscar nod is fluttering nigh? Or maybe maudlin melodramas are not au courant these days?What do we learn from this modern-day Jeremiah Johnson? Primarily that we all grieve in different ways, and that's OK. Some of us turn inward and dig deep into our best, creative selves and outwardly express our sadness and honorifics through painting or rededicating ourselves to our careers. Others of us turn hard and fast to straight-warm vodka by the tumbler, somewhat conspicuously near our tool benches in our garages.After diving into that vodka-infused Darkness, it's time to stand up and learn a bunch of important life skills, such as stabbing stuff with knives, shooting different types of guns with various gradations of mastery, and packing on protein pounds until all muscles work in a beautiful, harmonious concert of slaughter. You can accomplish any and all of your goals given enough time and dedication.It is not clear that the message of Silent Night is a good one, at least for our modern society. It is always okay to check your brain at the door of the movie theater, and on the way out of Silent Night, one would be also wise to check one's pants, for this is a seat-edge dark comedy that will fill your empty skull with raw entertainment.",
    "118": "FILM: 6.5/10.Embarking on my first watch of John Woo's 2023 film Silent Night, I found myself intrigued by the backstory. After the rocky reception of his 2003 film Paycheck, Woo returns to Hollywood after two decades, armed with something to prove.Silent Night opens with a promise - a dialogue-light script that hands the reins to Woo's visual storytelling prowess. Woo, often tagged as a one-trick pony in America, dispels that notion, showcasing his versatility across genres. The film's simplicity in premise does the job, providing a canvas for his directorial finesse.Yet, the central gimmick of a nearly mute cast becomes a double-edged sword. While initially inventive, it wears thin as the narrative progresses. Early on, the absence of audible dialogue is intriguing, but later, it risks becoming a distracting hurdle as the initial creativity wanes.Joel Kinnaman leads the charge, delivering a fair portrayal of grief early on. However, as the film unfolds, his silent expressions of pain, anger, and frustration veer into the comical, creating unintentional moments of levity that disrupt the intended gravitas.The film's saving grace lies in its action sequences, notably the impressive car chases. Woo's trademark slow-motion techniques are supported by the razor-sharp cinematography, providing a visceral and visually striking experience.In Silent Night, Woo may not hit the bullseye, but he certainly hits the target. It's a return worth noting, with moments of brilliance amid occasional hiccups. For action aficionados and Woo enthusiasts, it's a watch that offers glimpses of his directorial prowess, even if the silent experiment falls a tad flat.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10/10.Native 4K cinema presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.Dolby Atmos cinema audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 6/10.",
    "119": "Warning: This film contains a lot of hard stuff in different ways. Some parts are very emotional. Probably not for everyone. I would also say, if you have an unstable mind right now, don't watch it alone or skip it this time.If you like Joel Kinnaman and if you want get deeper into it, watch it. My advice: Don't turn it off to quickly.This film is not perfect, but it's a good movie and it does not need an oscar, because I always wanted to know, what is happening next and THAT is the magic, what I always want to happen, when I watch movies.If you are that kind of person, who can let go you will enjoy most of your invested time.Perhaps 7 stars are too much, but in the end, who cares if I gave 7,6 or even 5 stars?Merry christmas.",
    "120": "This is really a fundamentally good example on how not to make a good action movie. You have seen the lead actor Joel Kinnaman in a lot of better productions like in House of Cards and in the remake from 2014 called Robocop. In this movie I can't really see why he wasted his time even producing because it is really a mid action-movie at best. John Woo who is an expert at making action movies and has always been able to make decent movies despite hardcore action, like you see in the second Mission Impossible movie or in the first Red Cliff. But here it seems that he either ran out of ideas or that he just tried to be way too ambitious.Because when he tries to make a more serious movie without too much dialogue than reminds you of a scuffed version of Death Wish where it is nowhere near the violence or intensity of those movies you end up with a bad result, and even the Bruce Willis version from 2018 is better than this movie. There are so many moments where it had been way more natural that the characters actually had some sort of dialogue especially between the lead character and his girlfriend. Inistead he just sits sobbing drinking alone, and the movie tries to create this dark and devious mood that you never can live yourself into. Also the movie is vashed away by flashbacks a highly emotional mood by the beginning, when actually John Woo could have given us the classic revenge thriller a lot faster without going through all the side roads, with the emotional arc and long planning sequence in the garage leading up to a kill spree on christmas. Yes I get that he misses his son but it does not have to go through half the movie to deal with that loss, and because of that the movie at times seem more like a drama movie than an actual action movie.You have some good scenes with the high-octane opening sequence and it really looked better on the trailer than the on the final result. In addition you also got the fight scene right before the first hour is done, but rather than that the action scenes are done in a sloppy way where the main character is really not that challenged apart from the last fight. The action scenes really lack intensity and it is nothing like John Woo used to do in some of his earlier movies. You miss better characters and while these gangsters I am sure some of them could maybe be real characters you just feel they are portrayed to be too dumb and stupid to really be realistic.Walking into I expected a more hardcore and less sentimental drama/action movie where the main character actually said a few lines: \"John Wick\" does not talk that much either but it works better with a little dialogue in these sort of movies, at least if you do something with a lot less dialogue you need better imagination and a better plot. Of course such movies like these never have a good plot, but then at least the action scenes need to be more intense the main character need more challenges and the characters need to be a lot better. Jason Bourne may at times have it easy because he is a one-man army too but at least he struggles a lot more in some of the fights and some of the action movies these days are just not able to actually make gunfights or fist fights that entertaining anymore. Of course you have seen a lot of revenge plots in action movies, but this is one of the most mid I have seen at least and for me it's a 5/10.",
    "121": "John Woo's first American movie in 20 years, but it might as well have been a Chinese movie because - well, the Silent in the title is to be taken literally.Nobody talks.I'm old enough to have watched my share of silent movies, and I just have to say they improved when the actors began to speak.I also agree that there is way too much talking and narrating in todays movies. But removing it completely - I dunno - it doesn't work for me.There's John Woo action - and he is the king of action. But everything else is weirdly boring because it's just people who doesn't communicate. This means we don't get to know them, and thusly disengage.Joel kicks ass. He could have played Reacher with that physique. John Woo rocks with his action style. But they could have made a better movie.",
    "122": "First movie of John Woo in Hollywood since Paycheck in 2003 (that was an average movie).This movie is almost all based on the expression of the protagonist and secondary characters, even being previsible and a bit melodramatic (but the melodrama is dispersed thorough the movie), without any line whatsoever is something to be praised and offstream.A father suffers the sudden loss of his son in a gangs shootout in a fictional city on Texas, and barely surviving trying to catch the killers - no explanation why he have those skills in the start of the story and in the end being all movie a preparation for revenge is a big no-no on the script thought.But is enjoyable especially if you like revenge is better served cold movies. The tension is present and even being previsible the movie delivers the satisfaction of revenge in the end, building up tension till the end (I liked the final scene btw - it was something that was bothering me, and that little bit was explained and I mean his reactions to the mother that suffered such a hard loss too).Being a John Woo movie you expect very electrifying action scenes and you get those on sequences on the start, middle and especially end as it should be. Really nice and bloody btw - and for the acting of Joel Kinnaman as the only protagonist I decided to gave the movie one star more than it would be without him.So a 7.0 out 1f 10.0 / B for this one. If you crave action and revenge for Christmas this is it (speaking of Xmas, it only serves as a more dramatic starting point for the story - it could have been any time of the year, but hey we need something for the season every year right?).",
    "123": "John Woo is known for bringing action, sometimes some humor twisted in, some heavy emotion spinkled on to build drama, and ballet level bullets.None of what you expect is actually here. The artistry of his gun battle scenes is faded into a poorly choreographed barrage of random shooting. The poignant loss felt by say Chow Yun Fat or John Travolta offsetting their killing, is lost as angry unredeeming revenge that doesnt even contain pathos or any feeling of justice. It is just watching a man lose his son, and then walk away from everything else becoming obsessed with killing those who caused it. There is no YEAH...SHOOT HIM AGAIN DAMNIT joy in his quest!Its just, dark, gritty, fairly UN-entertaining death. None of his revenge victims had any idea who he was or that he had any reason. They just were people being killed.I dont recommend this to fans of revenge drama or artistic gunplay. Frankly it was very disappointing on all accounts. Woo has done better. MUCH better.",
    "124": "Right here we go.This overall is not a bad movie, the action is good when it happens towards the end.The big issue is that NOBODY speaks which is completely weird. Whoever cane up with the idea of absolutely no one to talk really needs to think about that choice and never do it again.The good guy can't talk I get that bug the wife doesn't talk the cops don't talk and the bad guys don't talk, but they all have no reason not to talk. There is just times you wait for some speech from someone but it never happens.Due to know one talking it makes it a very hard to watch and is rather boring. It's like watching all sports on your tv with no crowd noise or commentary and if you ever tried that it makes the sport very boring indeed.All in all I gave it a 6 star as the action was good. Not so sure why woo took out his doves and replaced it with some strange looking CGI love bird though.But all an all if this had a script with actual voices I'm sure the movie would of been much better to watch and would of recieved better reviews.",
    "125": "I would start describing this movie as a no-frills, action packed, fun to watch production. Silent Night is a well put together movie, the one that delivers on his promise: brain switch to off, engagement switch to on. Our hero is , as the title suggests (but you only really realize it after you saw the movie) silent after the inciting incident. Yet , through a very basic plot, good acting and a well written script, you are still fully able to grasp his evolution, motivation and anger, an anger so profound it ends up further complicating the life of our protagonist who, however, is deeply determined to take revenge over the unjust loss of his young child.The movie follows pretty much a very basic three act story structure, with act one and two (the loss of his child, his sense of helplesness and newfound motivation and preparation) taking about half the runtime (to exactly the point where you start craving for some action) and the remaining half of the movie is gun blazing action that leaves you oddly satisfied.Photography is good, not reaching the levels of John Wick 4 but nonetheless enjoyable. Stunts are well executed if not a little too unrealistic at times, but nothing you cannot easily go over considering the type of film. Action sequence are not as precise and well choreographed as John Wick, but on the other hand the story, despite being very easy, lets you get in touch a bit more with the Hero as he has to develop into a killing machine, since he has no specific skills to begin with, which makes for a good moment.If you like this sort of action movie, go see it. I have enjoyed it as it has delivered on his promise: a fun night at the movies with friends.",
    "126": "Firstly, I stop reading reviews when they say they couldn't get through the whole film, because, I would say, how can you review a film when you haven't seen the whole story? I always watch to the end, though I also always choose a bit more carefully, and I picked this on a whim, based on the \"John Wick\" marketing and Joel Kinnaman. When \"John Woo\" popped up as the director, I actually got excited, as a very big fan of his early Hong Kong movies (and to a lesser extent his classic nineties ones). Then, I had to switch it off after about 30 minutes. So feel free to move onto the next review, or...Having looked though some of the reviews here (after I switched it off), there are many valid reasons why this is such a mess. The opening sequence was silly but had that classic John Woo touch. What did it for me, was that the \"emotional\" build up was so overwrought and unbelievable, that I couldn't take it anymore. The acting was fine, but the film was so steeped in Technicolor, a la Wizard of Oz, that the world they existed was more like GTA. The \"gangsters\" were laughably stereotyped, which is ok in a video game when every character is an intentional stereotype to drive the gameplay, vs. This utter nonsense. It is a funny moment when the original Death Wish series manages to feel more emotional and connected with reality than this 2023 attempt, which played like a parody that was actually trying to be serious.I am going to watch the rest, out of principal, and because I want to see at least a spark of John Woo's trademark gun opera, otherwise I will only be left with the 30 minutes or so of sugar laden emotional garbage I managed to sit through already. Though apparently, I have at least another 30 minutes of that to trudge through first.",
    "127": "Look, it's dreary this year. No snow, rain, cold, horrible. Who wants to go outside? Now if you have two hours to waste, this movie is fine. So long as you enjoy watching bad people, I mean people with zero redeeming qualities, die in a revenge flick.And you can watch it with the volume down and do other things because, well, there isn't much dialog to speak off.Get it? SILENT NIGHT.Ah the writers found a pun and ran with it.They didn't draw out the story though, has more holes in it that the bad guys at the end when they are shot and shot and shot. And Shot. Then he is shot again. Double tap.This movie was made for streaming to people that need to do other things. 6/10.",
    "128": "Woo at his worst. I recently had the misfortune of watching the much-hyped action movie, \"Silent Night,\" and let me tell you, it was a colossal letdown. From start to finish, the film seemed more interested in showcasing mindless explosions than telling a coherent and engaging story.The plot, if you can call it that, felt like a mere afterthought. It was a mishmash of clichés and tired tropes, with muted cardboard-cutout characters going through the motions of a generic action movie. The protagonist, a supposed \"tough guy,\" lacked any depth or charisma, making it impossible to invest in his journey. I found myself struggling to care about the fate of the world, as the filmmakers failed to create any emotional connection with the audience.But perhaps the most egregious offence was the excessive and gratuitous use of gunfire and explosions. It's as if the filmmakers believed that more equals a better movie. It doesn't and the constant barrage of it quickly became monotonous and numbing, overshadowing any potential excitement the action sequences could have generated.Moreover, the special effects were subpar, resembling a video game from a decade ago rather than a blockbuster film in this day and age. The CGI felt lazy and uninspired, detracting from the overall viewing experience. I couldn't help but cringe at the poorly rendered explosions and lacklustre visual effects, wondering where the budget for this film actually went.The dialogue was another sore point. The muted characters were cringe-worthy. It seemed as though the writers were absent due to the recent WGA writer strike so dialogue were non-existent.Overall, \"Silent Night\" is a prime example of style over substance. If you're looking for a mindless spectacle with no regard for plot or character development, then this might be the film for you. However, if you prefer action movies with substance, compelling characters, and a thoughtfully crafted narrative, I suggest you steer clear of this cinematic disaster.",
    "129": "Average death wish vibe, been long haven't seen a John woo quite while. Is hard to recommend this one cause it doesn't have that signature gun fu that he started. Since the Wick franchise took flight, most action directors have been struggling to make something new with there stunts.I think John Woo need to go back to the king fu era of motion pictures to get it right, is not anybody fault that the film seem random.Superheroes genre is taking most the mojo of action films, that feel is gonna be extinct.So taBy far the best action ye get for your buck is Netflix\nExtraction 2.Thank you.",
    "130": "Yeah you.....this story is about a man...\nA man that will do what it takes to get it done.1) The strongest man in the world is he who stands most alone.2) Beware the fury of a patient man.3) The dead cannot cry out for justice. It is a duty of the living to do so for them.4) To exact revenge for yourself or your friends is not\nonly a right, it's an absolute duty.5) Distrust of authority should be the first civic duty.6) Every man has a wild beast within him.7) The strong man is strongest when alone.8) Do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man.9) Behind every great man is his wife trying to keep him alive.",
    "131": "Yes! It's been a while, but John Woo is back with a bang. The man still knows how to make an action movie and it shows. This feels good, reminded me of the 80s and 90s action style. The bad guys are basically just there to line up and get taken out. Hard. It looks stylish and violent at the same time.Sure, this flick doesn't bring anything new to the table, we've seen it all before. Many times even. But this one is definitely highly entertaining and above average.One thing though, whithout giving away too much, our main character (very well played by Joel Kinnaman) loses his voice in the beginning of the movie. This could've led to some interesting and tense moments during the movie, but it doesn't. It seems more like an excuse to create a cool, tough and silent \"hero\", which I consider a missed opportunity. How good would it have been if at some stage he desperately needed his voice to rescue someone or even himself from a dire situation, but was unable to produce a single word? None of that though. Like I said; missed opportunity.Nonetheless, I'm more than happy John Woo is back on the scene and hopefully more will follow.If you like action/revenge movies and are looking to be entertained without having to dig too deep into your emotions, definitely give this one a shot. 7 out of 10.",
    "132": "The film is a masterclass of visual storytelling, as Woo uses every cinematic tool at his disposal to convey the emotions, motivations, and actions of the characters. The film is full of stunning action sequences, ranging from car chases, shootouts, hand-to-hand combat, and explosions. Woo also pays homage to his classic films, such as The Killer (1989) and Hard Boiled (1992), by incorporating elements of slow motion, doves, and dual-wielding guns.Kinnaman delivers a powerful performance as Brian Godlock, a man who loses everything and becomes consumed by his quest for vengeance. He expresses his pain, anger, and determination through his body language, facial expressions, and actions. He is also convincing as an action hero, displaying physical prowess and agility in the fight scenes. The supporting cast, including Scott Mescudi, Harold Torres, and Catalina Sandino Moreno, also do a great job in their roles.Silent Night is a film that will appeal to fans of action, revenge, and John Woo. It is a film that does not need words to tell a compelling story, as it speaks louder than words through its action. It is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen, as it is a cinematic spectacle that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Silent Night is the best action film of 2023, and one of the best films of John Woo's career."
