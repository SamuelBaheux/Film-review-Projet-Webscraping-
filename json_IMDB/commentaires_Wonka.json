The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film.",
    "1": "WOW just wow this exceeded my expectations by a long way , I don't really rate the Tim Burton remake with his stablemate Jonny Depp it misses the charm of the cult classic 1971 sleeper hit with Gene Wilder but this was a brand new story , a brand new musical with instantly loveable songs & thankfully the song we weee all waiting for being added to full effect at just the right moment. The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10.",
    "2": "Origin stories can be hit (\"Wicked\" the musical) or miss (who even remembers \"Oz the Great and Powerful\"?). On that scale \"Wonka\" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame \"Wonka\". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of \"The French Dispatch\" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe \"Wonka\".",
    "3": "This was for me not quite the level of the original but better than Depps version. What I found most distracting was the endless need for songs where they weren't really needed, they weren't memorable or catchy they just felt lazy and forced, like every kids movie now seems to be full of music.The acting part was far better, story was sweet, solid and flowed nicely, a lot of fun cameos that most English tv fans will recognise, the design and costumes were great and the special effects were awesome to. Hugh grants little orange man was a highlight as was the talented girl who played noodle.Biggest floor... TC for me hasn't got a great voice for singing.",
    "4": "\"Wonka\" is a pleasant prequel to \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\", the script achieves a perfect story for the holiday season and for the whole family, with a simple but effective comedy and good dramatic moments that are strong points for the film production. The production level is excellent, the costume design manages to be fun and the performances are good, especially that of Timothée Chalamet as Willy Wonka, in addition to a successful special performance by Sally Hawkins. The musical numbers are well choreographed and managed to be performed by the voices of the entire cast. One negative thing to highlight are the digital special effects that look fake in every scene in which they are added. The editing work is of a good level. The music composed for the film has potential and is enjoyable. \"Wonka\" shines as a great movie for the Christmas season.",
    "5": "First of all... This new take on a young Wonka is actually fresh and interesting. We were used on Wonka being a secondary character of Charlie and the golden ticket story.The movie is well crafted but it has serious problems:i) Chalamet is a fantastic actor and has the potential to be one of the great ones of his generation BUT he was a miscast. Im sorry, but i just don´t see him as Wonka.Ii) Part of what makes a musical great is that the songs and numbers are meant to be remarkable and catchy. After almost 80 years, people still sing singin´in the rain yet Wonka has no memorable song or tune except for the Oompa Loompa bit that was taken straight outta the original one.To me, this 2 flaws are terrible and make it a bad Wonka movie and a bad musical but taking those out of the equation, it is actually a good film.Enjoy it with your loved ones,Stay safe and happy holidays.",
    "6": "I went to go watch this movie out of personal interest since I was a huge fan of the 2005 Willy Wonka version.For this movie specifically, it was a good attempt. People did get to learn more depthful insights on what drives Willy Wonka to become who he is. His color inspirations and drive backed by a lack of common sense defines his name.The creative uses of candy and colorful creations are enough to inspire anyone. The story and development was all right, a little simple but gets the job done.My only issue was how there was a bit too much singing. The songs are all right but some songs weren't needed. There could of been more time spent on critical development for Wonka.",
    "7": "Oh so disappointed with this film. Been looking forward to it being released, I mean who doesn't love Willy Wonka.45 minutes into the film I was looking at my watch. I was so bored. The music was awful, the singing even worse. The story was terribly weak and very dull. I couldn't care less. I couldn't get invested in any of the characters apart from Hugh Grant who was adorable. He was the only character that kept me marginally entertained.The snowy cold scenes made it feel Christmassy, a bit like a Dickensian film which was okay. It just lacked magic. It could have been so much more.I just wanted to leave the cinema. If I had gone to watch this film on my own, I would have left.",
    "8": "I had high hopes with Wonka mainly due to the fact Paul King was directing. Paddington 1 &2 are some of the best family films ever made and their charm makes them a great watch every time. Wonka now joins that list.First off, the production design is spectacular. It really is pure imagination. The costumes, set pieces, songs and casting were all fantastic. The pacing was spot on and no time did I feel bored or that it dragged.Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa was brilliant but for me Timothee Chalamet stole the show. His singing and acting was fantastic and really immersed you in the Wonka story.2023 has been a fantastic year for film and Wonka rounds off the year perfectly. A must watch!",
    "9": "Greetings again from the darkness. It appears as though I'm one of the few early viewers who walked away without having been beguiled or enraptured with this musical prequel to Roald Dahl's 1964 story, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". Full disclosure requires me to admit that I actually found it a bit dull, and that's mostly due to the lead performance by Timothy Chalamet. I understand that he's the hottest young actor working today, and brings along an entire fan base, but for me, Willy Wonka should have a twinkle in his eye, a spring in his step, and enough charm to draw folks in ... even at a younger age.Writer-director Paul King and co-writer Simon Farnaby collaborated on the thoroughly entertaining PADDINGTON 2 (2017) and are back at it in this third film from Dahl's classic children story. Most recently, there was Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005), and it's been more than 50 years since Gene Wilder bounded between charming and menacing in Mel Stuart's WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (1971). King and Farnaby deliver an origin story which allows for a much nicer (or should it be sweeter) Willy Wonka, and instead sprinkles the menace on a few supporting characters, ensuring some dark themes are present.A \"deal\" with Willy's mother (Sally Hawkins) has the illiterate Wonka arriving in town with only a few coins in his pocket, and a dream to build his chocolate factory. His innocence and naivety soon leave him penniless and contracted into indentured servitude, along with some others, at a shady laundry establishment run by the dentally challenged Mrs Scrubbitt (Oscar winner Olivia Colman) and her baritone behemoth assistant Bleacher (Tom Davis). Willy bonds with the others being held captive, including young orphan Noodle (Calah Lane), who somehow holds the same optimistic outlook as her new friend. Willy soon discovers that he has landed in the town with a chocolate cartel led by Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton), the local chocolatiers who bribe the Police Chief (Keegan-Michael Key) with none other than ... chocolate, in order to keep the new kid from selling his superior goodies.Willy has even more challenges to deal with, including a knee-high, orange-faced Oompa-Loompa (Hugh Grant), who seeks restitution by stealing from Willy Wonka while he sleeps. Grant's Oompa-Loompa is a definite highlight here (just as he was in PADDINGTON 2), especially during his song. The other familiar song in the film is \"Pure Imagination\", though none of the new songs by Neil Hannon are particular catchy or memorable.In addition to Grant's sarcastic Oompa-Loompa, another highlight is certainly Nathan Crowley's Production Design, ranging from Scrubbitt's grungy basement to the picturesque town square and ultimately, the chocolate store sequence. The decision to have the young, idealistic Willy overflowing with optimism and lacking the grumpiness and menace of the grown Wonka makes sense for an origin story ... I simply didn't find it as magical, as entertaining, or as interesting.Opens in theaters nationwide on December 15, 2023.",
    "10": "There's a lot to like in Wonka, the lead Timothy Chalamet is perfect and a fabulous lead and a great voice for the original songs written for the film.But for the running time I wanted a better story than we was given, mediocre characters and unmemorable performances other than the lead does not a great film make,everyone does their best but the writing is very weak and sadly the modern use of cartel and violence in the film felt out of place & unnecessary.As a prequel to Willy Wonka this falls short,though it has it's charm with luscious sets and colours but sadly I found it disappointing.",
    "11": "Wonka (2023) :\nMovie Review -Wonka Review: So you must have read Roal Dahl's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (1964); you must have seen Gene Wilder's blockbuster \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" (1971) and then Tom Burton-Johnny Depp's mega hit \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005), so now it's time for Timothée Chalamet's origin story of Willy Wonka with \"Wonka\" (2023). It's been almost seven decades, and the tale hasn't lost a bit of its magic. It's so enchanting, joyful, and colourful that all you need to do is handle it with your good skills. That's it. You have success in your hands because the source material is just too good. Comedy lover Paul King gets it right. Paul understood the assignment well. Wonka is an exhilarant, amusing, extremely engaging, musically vibrant, and full of chocolate entertainer that stays true to its origin and gives it a nice modern touch as well.Wonka is like a prequel to what you have seen in Wilder and Depp's movies. There you have a chocolate factory, and here the story takes you to the backstory before the factory was built. Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) is a youngster with the talent to make incredible chocolates. He isn't settled yet, though. Rather, he hasn't started his career. He keeps wandering the streets and halls and showcasing his talent for making chocolate that can instantly win people's tongues and stomachs. Since he is selling chocolates at cheap rates that even \"poor\" people can afford, the competitors sense the danger. They try their best to keep him out of the business in whatever way possible, and most of the time they succeed. Amidst his ambition of becoming a great chocolate maker, Wonka is scammed by a small hotel owner and is made her servant for years to come. With the help of Noodle/Nicole (Calah Lane) and other imprisoners, Wonka must find a way out and also set his business against the corrupt chocolate businessmen.First of all, Paul King has written a king-size entertainer for all age groups. The humour is organic, the gags are real, and the magical touch of Wonka's fantasy world makes this one very interesting and engaging. The musical numbers are also well written, as the lyrics have meaning to keep the mood going. Wonka's origin story is not old or outdated; rather, it's completely unknown for many, and that's why there are so many pleasant surprises in the movie. In the end, we see Wonka building the factory, which we all know, and you can connect dots very well there. We are short on good musical comedies nowadays, and thanks to Paul King for writing one that lives up to expectations. We had children, young males and females, and adults in our special show, and the comical segment had us all in splits at the time. I think that's just dandy. I was craving; I was drooling for chocolates by the end, and I wish I could enter the screen just like Mia Farrow did it in Woody Allen's \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" (1985) and devour the mashmello and all the flavours. It's so freaking tasty.Timothée Chalamet is fantastic as Wonka. I wouldn't dare compare this young lad with legends like Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder, but yes, he is our Willy Wonka, alright. If those generations remember Wilder and Depp at that time, then let this social media generation remember Chalamet. Calah Lane is a sweet child with some adorable scenes, and she looks so cute in all of them. Paterson Joseph is not the deadly, cruel, but funnily cruel villain here that one would expect in a chocolate-comedy flick like this. There is something about his character that we miss in so many other musical comedies. Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton (that yuk \"poor\" joke was so rich) support him well. Keegan-Michael Key's transformation had the audience on a roll by the end. Our favourite Mr. Bean, Rowan Atkinson, is a desperate chocoholic, but who must have thought about giving his character the reference of a priest? I mean, it's so hilarious to know. The first frame of his had the audience hooting, and we all really wanted him to have more screen space. Jim Carter, Tom Davis, Olivia Colman, Hugh Grant, Sally Hawkins, Natasha Rothwell, Rakhee Thakrar, Rich Fulcher, and others were fine in their supporting roles.Joby Talbot's songs have made Wonka extra delicious, and one can even go on tapping their feet in the cinema hall without even realising when that process begins, automatically. I was tapping my feet, and I didn't even realise it. Mark Everson's editing has literally no flaws. The only scene that looked slow and dated was when Noodle finds her mother, and then you have to think again to know how important that scene was for the film. Chung-hoon Chung's camera gives you some yummy frames of chocolate and whatnot. Roald Dahl's classic character needed a modern restoration on celluloid, and Paul King has given us that. Action, music, comedy, a little bit of a thrill, and an overflow of chocolates-that's what Paul serves you on the table in no time. Scrumptious is the word! \"You've never tasted chocolate like this,\" says Wonka in one of the songs, and I can assure you that he really meant it. This chocoholic musical melody deserves to be swallowed with tasty rashes on your tongue. There is no need to go to any chocolate shop; just visit the nearest cinema hall.RATING - 6/10*",
    "12": "Wonka is an amazing movie! This film, directed by Paul King, is a feel-good musical that took me on a very emotional ride. Viewers learn the origin story of the eccentric chocolatier and magician.Willy (Timothée Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the Gallery Gourmet but quickly runs out of money. He meets Bleacher (Tom Davis), who introduces Willy to Mrs. Scrubbitt (Olivia Colman), who tricks him into a contract and forces him to work in her laundry room to pay off his debt. There he meets other indentured workers - Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), Lottie Bell (Rakhee Thakrar) and Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher). Noodle (Calah Lane) becomes Willy's closest ally and joins him to defeat the corrupt Chocolate Cartel and reach his goal of opening a chocolate shop.I never expected to feel so many emotions in a Willy Wonka movie. There is the familiar magicalness of Willy who whips up the most amazing chocolate and candy confections, like Hoverchocs that can make you fly. Yet the performances, musical score and art direction really pulled me into the story. The song, \"Pure Imagination,\" appears in different versions throughout the film and adds to the emotional experience. I really like the character development and the sibling-like friendship between Willy and Noodle. When Willy agrees to secretly leave town to free his friends, Timothée Chalamet's singing of \"Sorry Noodle\" had me crying my eyes out. The evilness of the Chocolate Cartel led by Mr. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph) had me so angry as they repeatedly try to defeat Willy and they eventually trap Willy and Noodle. My favorite part is when the Oompa Loompa Lofty (Hugh Grant) saves Willy and Noodle from being drowned in chocolate.The message of Wonka is to let your imagination run wild and keep striving for your dreams even when the odds are stacked against you. In the end, the struggle will be worth it, especially if you have friends to share your success with.I give Wonka 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. The film will be released in theaters on December 15, 2023. By Kira O., KIDS FIRST!",
    "13": "This film is nothing like the older Willy Wonka films and is a huge disappointment. The story is altered a bit without giving too much away but it's not interesting enough to hold your attention. The acting is pretty average, although better in comparison to the other aspects of the film such as its humour. That's my next point, it's not funny at all. I maybe gave a little smile at 1 or 2 moments but that is all, which makes this film a failure as a comedy movie. The older Wonka films had much better humour and far better acting, therefore resulting in a much more enjoyable experience.The music is also distractingly irritating, and is certain to break windows. I regret seeing this and am dissapointed as I enjoyed the older films.Maybe young children will enjoy it but if you don't have any then I would give it a miss without a doubt.",
    "14": "First of all, it's a musical, and it's not a bad musical, because the songs are cool and there are not a million of them, so they don't get boring.All the actors are perfectly suited to their roles of Roald Dahl's comic characters, and this atmosphere is conveyed here even better than in the adaptation of Matilda or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with Johnny Depp.I caught a few clichés, but it's not that it's terrible, because the strong point of this movie is the atmosphere, not the plot. I was in a good mood after watching it.P. S. I was very upset not to see the green minicar throughout the movie.",
    "15": "I had no interest in seeing Wonka. Just like Solo: A Star Wars Story, I didn't need a movie about Willy Wonka's backstory; his real story is in the main story of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Sometimes less is more, and leaving his backstory out gives him more mystery and intrigue. I liked Timothee Chalamet as Wonka well enough, he's got great charisma, and all of the other cast do a great job too. The songs are really hit or miss, and most feel like songs I've heard in lesser known musicals before. It's passable for a Willy Wonka origin story. I appreciated the characters love of chocolate and wonder. But I think a movie like 2000s Chocolat (ironically staring Johnny Depp) plays with the love of chocolate and fantasy better, I'd recommend it more than this. Maybe giving Wonka the Greatest Showman set up would've helped this movie more. If you're a Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory fan, this probably won't do much for you. I'll give it a solid 6 out of 10.",
    "16": "I adore the original 1971 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it is a true classic. The 2005 edition with Johnny Depp was okay but compared to this film it is a masterpiece of epic proportion.Chalamet does not do a great job as the titular character, it feels like he was overacting constantly. The story is strange and is hard to follow. The visuals may look attractive to some but personally I found them nauseating. The songs are terrible and forgettable, and there is an unnecessary amount of them. Very very few jokes land.Hugh Grant does an ok job but others did not perform here.Don't waste your money seeing this.",
    "17": "Had potential but Chalamet clearly does not have the range or charm to deliver us to a whimsical or magical world of candy that can levitate viewers into a world that the previous iterations did.The directing and writing from Paul King and Simon Farnaby was lacking this time around compared to Paddington with Hugh Grant doing the biggest carry job in a film as the smallest of side characters.Instead of taking your family to this abomination, stay at home, make some hot chocolate and rewatch the original or even the Depp remake and you will enjoy your holidays much more for the better. These remakes of classics really needs to stop and Timothy Chalamet needs to stay in his lane playing emotionless blank characters aside from the agnaty teenager archetypes.",
    "18": "Spectacular production, wonderful casting and a fantastic soundtrack to boot. I was simply blown away by so many amazing original songs and performances, and there was a good balance of comedy and drama that would appeal to the whole family.Having only seen a movie poster of Wonka, I did not have much to go on. I did not even know it was a musical until the movie started, and then, I was engaged from beginning to end.From the playful glint in his eyes to his quirky smiles and cane-twirling sequences, Timothee Chalamet's whimsical performance gives nods to both Johnny Depp's and Gene Wilder's earlier depictions of Wonka, while still adding his own spin and spice (and all things nice) to the young Wonka he plays.There is a purity and crispness in Chalamet's delivery of both script and song that encapsulates that sense of wonder a young Willy Wonka manages to hold on to through the formative years of his youth, despite all the setbacks and hardships that befalls him. And this is key because it carries over into his later years, and it is the re-imagining through this lens of childlike innocence that inspires audiences around the world to have hope and dare to dream again.Special mention to Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa, who delivers his lines in perfect matter-of-fact British fashion. My niece liked his performance so much, she was singing Oompa Loompa all the way home, while I tried to sway her to sing Pure Imagination instead.If there is one movie to catch this Christmas with your loved ones, this should be it! And would I watch it again? Oh, ABSOLUTELY!",
    "19": "Wonka is a 2023 musical fantasy starring Timothy Chalamet,Hugh Grant,Jim Carter,Olivia Coleman,Keegan Michael Key and Matt Lucas. Directed by Paul King(Paddington),the story tells the tale of Willy Wonka(Chalamet) who dreams of opening up his own chocolate store. But he ends up being stuck in a bnb owned by an evil couple (Coleman)who uses their guests as slaves. So Willy decides to make his dream a reality by asking the slaves to help him create a chocolate store in spit of the evil chocolaters and of course the evil couple. Will he succeed in his dreams?.Overall I enjoyed this film. The songs are good but not as memorable as say The Greatest Showman(they are more like Mary Poppins Returns)and the story has been done before so many times. Hugh Grant had me in stitches throughout as the Oompa Loompa.If you enjoyed Mary Poppins Returns or The Greatest Showman then you'll love this film. Also features Rowan Atkinson as a priest.",
    "20": "I saw Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet-Dune_2021, Homeland_tv; Olivia Colman-The Crown_tv, Fleabag_tv; Keegan Michael Key-The Predator_2018, Keanu; Rowan Atkinson-the Johnny English movies, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Hugh Grant-Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, Four Weddings and a Funeral.This is a prequel telling the origin story of Willy Wonka, as played by Timothee. It's also a musical. Timothee arrives in a little town that is known for it's chocolate makers, to set up his own little chocolate shop. In fact, it is run by a cartel of chocolatiers but they don't want any competition, so they do everything that they can to hinder Timothee setting up his business. Olivia plays a shady boarding house lady that puts Timothee-and others-into a situation where the residents have to work off their rent in her basement. Keegan is a policeman and Rowan is a priest that the chocolatiers bribe to do their bidding-with chocolate, of course-and Hugh plays an Oompa Loompa that is after Timothee for his own reasons. If you liked the 1971 Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory or the 2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, you should like this one, too. I liked it better.It's rated PG for mild violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.I liked it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",
    "21": "This is how you stretch ten minutes of predictable and bad plot out over two hours.Even worse it's a musical with terrible, cringeworthy songs. Felt like getting up and walking out every time they started singing, found myself just sitting and knowing the pain of another horrendous song was coming.Nothing was funny in this film, it was just painful. Blatantly obvious that Roald Dahl had nothing to do with writing this. It just seemed like another pointless reboot of something for the sake of making a film.Definitely could not cope with having to watch this a second time. Once was a lot more than enough for me.",
    "22": "I was skeptical going into this one & of course when I first heard about it, but nonetheless, went into seeing it as I have seen the 1971 Original & 2005 Remake of the Charlie & The Chocolate Factory Films.With dreams of opening a shop in a city renowned for its chocolate, a young and poor Willy Wonka discovers that the industry is run by a cartel of greedy chocolatiers.I found the film to be quite good! It's got a good story, good characters & plenty of visuals & dazzling ace effects. Even for a musical, it's ace & really well made! The films a little long at 1 hour & 50 minutes & does drag a tad bit, but it's good with some not bad songs that are well shot when the actors dance & break into song!Overall, it's a pretty good film! Visually stunning, great characters & pretty good story with a feel good ending!7/10.",
    "23": "I agree with one reviewer over Timothee Chalamet portrayal of Willy Wonka. And that the late great Gene Wilder the original is the original.But this is a new version over in the late Ronald Dahl's book series. Timothee's Wonka is innocent but optimistic and how that he is poor but still doesn't stop him.He plans to spend a night over in a lodge like, only to be tricked into paying more and when he can't come up with it, forced to do laundry with others like him who can't pay against their will as the owners were bribing people.But when his new friends including an accountant and comedian to name a few. And an imprisoned orphan named Noodle who wants to find her real parents, want to figure out a way to make their way home and be release from their predicament.Wonka only can make chocolate but the antagonist in the movie a corrupt chocolate maker names Sluggsworth and his two minions want to put their plans in action who gets a corrupted police chief played by the hilarious Keegan Michael Kay to stop Wonka.The chief seems to be decent but is conflict. It is with a great ensemble cast with Rowan Atkinson as a corrupt priest.",
    "24": "This is a bad movie i didn't know it was a musican so it was a suprise i didn't like at all. It was a movie that mabye had a somewhat good story but there were songs every 5 minutes and they were so predictible that me and my friend could predict every one.There were no good joles all of them were too old or just too bad to consider a GOOD joke.There were also good charecters but there were to much bad ones to go with them.There are some poor trys at teaching some lessons like don't trust stranges and such but it wasn't some good trys and it is obviously made for children of younger age allthou it is 12+\nAnd the movie is so boring that I wrote this whole review while the movie is playing.",
    "25": "The castings for this movie was perfect. Was a bit goofy but charming and fun. It had alot of heart in the movie and really made it fun for the audience. The story line was very simple which i apprecaited for this movie. I did not need a complex story line simple wonka wanted to help and sell chocolate and had to overcome obsticales with a dream that made wonka extremly lovable. Overall the scenes were very over the top but it worked for this movie. I really enjoyed it under the timefrane and really was a feel good christmas movie. This was an incredible prequel and would easily want to see more.",
    "26": "Wonka is a prequel to the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. This prequel was directed and partly written by Paul King, the director of the two Paddington films.Young Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) tries to bring more flavor to the world with his own unique chocolate. When he tries to do this with his own chocolate sales, Willy gets into trouble with the chocolate cartel. This cartel is run by Slugworth (Patterson Joseph), who runs the chocolate trade in more corrupt, dishonest ways.Together with Noodle (Calah Lane) and the fellow residents of Willy's new apartment complex, they secretly try to go against Slugworth's chocolate trade, so that people can enjoy different chocolates and other sweets from Willy Wonka's unique recipes and preparation methods in fairer ways. .\nThe book adaptation of Roald Dahl, his book about Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory, was well received around 1971. They managed to make this film unique, once in the chocolate factory with colorful environments filled with different sweets. What further made this film unique was the acting of Gene Wilder, who managed to make the role of Willy Wonka his own with his own creative input.In 2005, the film was remade with Johnny Depp playing the role of Willy Wonka. This remake was directed by Tim Burton, who also gave the film his own twist, which made the film a bit more unusual and dark.Now with this prequel to Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, Timothée Chalamet gets the opportunity to make the role and the origin story a little more personal and develop it further. Unfortunately, he continues to play the role a bit safer and within the lines. As a result, the younger version of Willy Wonka misses his mysterious, special sides. Timothée Chalamet's singing is good, but seems a bit less pure compared to Gene Wilder's singing. Fortunately, other cast members know how to provide better and more appropriate singing, such as Calah Lane.In the original film, it takes about the first 45 minutes of the film for Willy Wonka's character to emerge in the film. In this prequel you get to see this character from the beginning, but after about an hour and fifteen minutes his fledgling chocolate factory really makes an appearance. In the beginning you follow Willy Wonka more as an illegal street seller of chocolate, while he tries to stay out of the hands of the chocolate cartel. This gives the film a different atmosphere. Once you get closer to the chocolate factory, the film may seem a bit more familiar. However, the film does miss some of the unique magical environments that the original film had. In the original film, Willy Wonka's helpers, the Oompa Loompas, were played by small actors. In this film, an Oompa Loompa is played by Hugh Grant, who is transformed into Oompa Loompa with special effects. This way, credibility is lost somewhat. Sometimes it can also come across as a bit unusual thanks to the visual effects. Because more use is made of visual effects, this film may seem less believable compared to the original film.This way, this film can become a new youth film for the modern generation, who can grow up with this film. Furthermore, the film may also be entertaining for fans of Timothée Chalamet.",
    "27": "I enjoyed this more than I expected, though the trailer did spoil a lot of the best scenes. The story was basic yes, but the casting was on point and there were a lot of dancing and singing. Lots of tongue in cheek comedy with the exceptional Rowan Atkinson, who played a chocoholic pastor.Timothée Chalamet can sing and dance (a young Hugh Jackman in the making); he was a joy to watch! The rest of the cast was just as good. The music was really memorable too (the oompa loompah song will be stuck in your head for a bit). Speaking of the song: Hugh Grant's casting as the orange little minions was genius!So if you enjoy musicals, go watch Wonka, you won't be disappointed! Oh and be forewarned: you will be craving chocolate after watching the movie!",
    "28": "Don't we need so many more of these types of films? Heartwarming feelgood wholesome fun. Friendship and dreams. Great songs. Remaining positive even in challenging times. One hour and fifty six minutes floats by gently and yet swiftly. Not a bad note throughout the film. Kids under ten will love it. Even my thirteen year old son gave it nine out of ten. The director also made the Paddington films and whilst it was not as good as them, it was still a great way to spend two hours. All of the actors were exceptional and you could almost tell that they had as much fun making it as we did watching it. Take your children to see it. You and your family will not be disappointed.",
    "29": "At first I wasnt very sure of Timothée being Wonka but after watching the movie I definitely changed my mind. He was great as Wonka!Hugh Grant was great as an Oompa Loompa, it was very funny seeing him as a small orange man with green hair.I loved the new characters like Noodle, Mrs. Scrubitt, Bleacher, the 3 chocolate cartels and there were so many more and they were all great!This version of Wonka has nothing to do with the previous movies \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" or \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" it is completely different, it is about how Willy Wonka became the famous chocolatier we know now.There were many musical numbers including new versions of \"Pure Imagination\" and \"Oompa Loompa\" it was very nostalgic and nice to hear again. The Original Score is amazing, and I haven't stoped listening to it since it came out, it's just something else, it's magic! To be honest I cried when Timothée started singing \"Pure Imagination\".There is a scene where Wonka and Noodle are running away from the zoo and singing as well as dancing and that specific scene melted my heart, it was so sweet and nice.Timothee brought a new version of Wonka to the world, there are references to the Gene Wilder Wonka and when you notice them there is a little spark in you which makes you smile! The movie is filled with love, happiness and hope as well as adventure.I really recommend going and watching this movie in the theatre with your family, friends and loved ones in general, it brings a bit of hope to you and it was just so magical.The cast was amazing and they all did an amazing job!\"Everything in the world started with a dream\" 🍫🎩",
    "30": "It took me awhile to feel comfortable with the singing and the characters, and I remember distinctly wondering if was I going to \"feel it\", but at some point the movie sucked me in and I felt like a kid again! Sure it was predictable as some mentioned, but I felt the way this movie delivered was creative and imaginative. I know others around me were feeling it too because we laughed together and struggled to hold back tears towards the end. Worth the hype. Worth my time. Worth my money. Oh yeah, there were twenty six minutes of previews and targeted ads past the official start time. If you bring your kids, don't arrive early.",
    "31": "Charlie and the chocolate factory is my all time favourite movie (2005 version). I watch it 2 times every year; on christmas eve and during the easter Holiday. To be honest i was counting down the days until this premiere since they announced it, which was nearly a year!I was expecting it to be a little similar to the originals and that it would have SOMETHING to do with christmas, however it didnt. I felt like I was watching Oliver Twist, not willy wonka. What disappointed me the most was the storyline. We get to know some of Wonkas childhood in Charlie and the chocolate factory, for instance that he grew up with a prestigious dentist father (dr.wonka) who refused him chocolate/candy and he was sent away for chosing candy over his father at the age of 11. In this movie the story is completely different, showing us a loving (poor) mother who makes him chocolate from scratch on their houseboat. He persues chocolate in the hopes of seeing her again. This doesnt fit what we already know, and I prefer the original version. It would be much better if they went with this in my opinion. I always assumed that he wanted to prove his father wrong, that was his motivation to success. The end of Charlie and the chocolate factory where he made his father proud was moving.Also, the discovery of the tonka beans and their magic is a big part of Charlie and the chocolate factory. The «little man with green hair and orange skin» doesnt look like an Oompa-Loompa at all. He also talks english, not their language (which was fun). And the version of him going there and just finding 4 of their beans is BORING compared to how it was originally. He basically just saw them right away, took them and left. It is a lovely movie, but there is a lot of signing (the songs arent even that great) and some scenes just doesnt make any sense. The scene where they milk the giraffe and start signing is cringy. I barely managed to watch it finish. All in all a fairly good movie, but nothing compared to Charlie and the chocolate factory. I love that movie and all the Harry Potter movies (same creators), but this is just average. Sorry. It felt rushed and just did not fill my expectations. Hopefully someone else chares my opinion and makes a even better version in the future.",
    "32": "I just saw Wonka in a theater and it's probbably one of my favorite movies. I didn't had high hopes for Wonka and I was not dissapointed.Everything is just great in this film. The cast was awesome, Thimothee Chalament was so great as Willy Wonka and Rowan Atkinson, Keegan Miachel Key, Hugh Grant were great. With this lovely performance I think Timothee Chalament is the best Wonka.I'm really glad that Paul King (director of Paddington 1 and 2) directed this movie because he truly does know how to make a family movie.Wonka is a magical, fun, and a heartwarming movie I seen so far and it's a Christmas film.",

That was not a good, but a GREAT choice if you ask me. Too many remakes today are so to tell 'forced copies' of the once so celebrated original movie. Just a handful is perhaps better than the original. This movies accomplished to succeed at that.Also, big plus one for the humour in some scenes! (:",
    "34": "I don't expect to enjoy this movie that much, but turns out this is became my favorite movie this year. The plot was predictable and simple, i feel like for this one the problem isn't complicated enough and wonka seems too naive, yet somewhat it what makes it feels really special. It is very different from the previous two movies, and it is refreshing but still feels nostalgic. I was laughing, and crying (of course) and i usually find musical movies boring, but i love every single song here. Timothee and those other great actors hit those note delicately. My inner child was filled with so much happiness. Overall it's a perfect holiday movie.",
    "35": "I agree with one reviewer over Timothee Chalamet portrayal of Willy Wonka. And that the late great Gene Wilder the original is the original.But this is a new version over in the late Ronald Dahl's book series. Timothee's Wonka is innocent but optimistic and how that he is poor but still doesn't stop him.He plans to spend a night over in a lodge like, only to be tricked into paying more and when he can't come up with it, forced to do laundry with others like him who can't pay against their will as the owners were bribing people.But when his new friends including an accountant and comedian to name a few. And an imprisoned orphan named Noodle who wants to find her real parents, want to figure out a way to make their way home and be release from their predicament.Wonka only can make chocolate but the antagonist in the movie a corrupt chocolate maker names Sluggsworth and his two minions want to put their plans in action who gets a corrupted police chief played by the hilarious Keegan Michael Kay to stop Wonka.The chief seems to be decent but is conflict. It is with a great ensemble cast with Rowan Atkinson as a corrupt priest.",
    "36": "This is a bad movie i didn't know it was a musican so it was a suprise i didn't like at all. It was a movie that mabye had a somewhat good story but there were songs every 5 minutes and they were so predictible that me and my friend could predict every one.There were no good joles all of them were too old or just too bad to consider a GOOD joke.There were also good charecters but there were to much bad ones to go with them.There are some poor trys at teaching some lessons like don't trust stranges and such but it wasn't some good trys and it is obviously made for children of younger age allthou it is 12+\nAnd the movie is so boring that I wrote this whole review while the movie is playing.",
    "37": "The castings for this movie was perfect. Was a bit goofy but charming and fun. It had alot of heart in the movie and really made it fun for the audience. The story line was very simple which i apprecaited for this movie. I did not need a complex story line simple wonka wanted to help and sell chocolate and had to overcome obsticales with a dream that made wonka extremly lovable. Overall the scenes were very over the top but it worked for this movie. I really enjoyed it under the timefrane and really was a feel good christmas movie. This was an incredible prequel and would easily want to see more.",
    "38": "Wonka is a prequel to the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. This prequel was directed and partly written by Paul King, the director of the two Paddington films.Young Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) tries to bring more flavor to the world with his own unique chocolate. When he tries to do this with his own chocolate sales, Willy gets into trouble with the chocolate cartel. This cartel is run by Slugworth (Patterson Joseph), who runs the chocolate trade in more corrupt, dishonest ways.Together with Noodle (Calah Lane) and the fellow residents of Willy's new apartment complex, they secretly try to go against Slugworth's chocolate trade, so that people can enjoy different chocolates and other sweets from Willy Wonka's unique recipes and preparation methods in fairer ways. .\nThe book adaptation of Roald Dahl, his book about Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory, was well received around 1971. They managed to make this film unique, once in the chocolate factory with colorful environments filled with different sweets. What further made this film unique was the acting of Gene Wilder, who managed to make the role of Willy Wonka his own with his own creative input.In 2005, the film was remade with Johnny Depp playing the role of Willy Wonka. This remake was directed by Tim Burton, who also gave the film his own twist, which made the film a bit more unusual and dark.Now with this prequel to Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, Timothée Chalamet gets the opportunity to make the role and the origin story a little more personal and develop it further. Unfortunately, he continues to play the role a bit safer and within the lines. As a result, the younger version of Willy Wonka misses his mysterious, special sides. Timothée Chalamet's singing is good, but seems a bit less pure compared to Gene Wilder's singing. Fortunately, other cast members know how to provide better and more appropriate singing, such as Calah Lane.In the original film, it takes about the first 45 minutes of the film for Willy Wonka's character to emerge in the film. In this prequel you get to see this character from the beginning, but after about an hour and fifteen minutes his fledgling chocolate factory really makes an appearance. In the beginning you follow Willy Wonka more as an illegal street seller of chocolate, while he tries to stay out of the hands of the chocolate cartel. This gives the film a different atmosphere. Once you get closer to the chocolate factory, the film may seem a bit more familiar. However, the film does miss some of the unique magical environments that the original film had. In the original film, Willy Wonka's helpers, the Oompa Loompas, were played by small actors. In this film, an Oompa Loompa is played by Hugh Grant, who is transformed into Oompa Loompa with special effects. This way, credibility is lost somewhat. Sometimes it can also come across as a bit unusual thanks to the visual effects. Because more use is made of visual effects, this film may seem less believable compared to the original film.This way, this film can become a new youth film for the modern generation, who can grow up with this film. Furthermore, the film may also be entertaining for fans of Timothée Chalamet.",

After years of struggle, he scrapes enough coin to buy a boat ticket and sets off to find a lost island - said to be the home of the best cocoa beans in the world. On the boat ride, he meets Noodle, a girl in search of her scientist mother who got lost at sea. A storm breaks, causing the ship to land on - you guessed it - the island, which they also learn is home to the Oompa Loompas, a very hard working but strict people who worship the cocoa bean. There, Willy and Noodle find Noodle's mom - a prisoner of the Oompa Loompas, and Lofty - Hugh Grant's character who was exiled from the village for attempting to free her. Willy, Lofty and Noodle steal three cocoa beans and free Noodle's mom. They get caught but Willy puts his talent to work and makes the best chocolate candy the Oompa Loompas have ever tasted. The Oompa Loompas agree to let them go and allow Lofty to return to the fold, but now Lofty has a taste for adventure. He wants to help Willy achieve his dream: opening his first chocolate shop. The Oompa Loompas help Willy fix his boat and the group sails back to the known world.In a wondrous winter town where our group crosses paths with Slugworth, the Godfather of chocolate (no need for three of them), an evil wretched man who has monopolized the chocolate trade for years. We also learn he might have had something to do with Noodle's mom's disappearance. The Godfather learns about the cocoa beans and plans to take Willy and his friends out and take the beans for himself. Then we proceed into Act 3 of the movie where the Godfather sabotages every attempt made by Willy to open his first shop and hunts them down. During a big celebration for the town Mayor (Rowan Atkinson)'s birthday, Noodle and her mom build a device that helps Willy craft his best chocolate yet. Willy and Lofty expose the Godfather. As a reward, the Mayor grants Willy the deed to a small piece of property - a corner store where Willy starts his first chocolate business. Years later, we step into Willy Wonka's factory, a spectacle of color like we've never seen before. No hotel/laundry plot, no chocolate mafia, no police stuff. The giraffe can stay cause Abigail was gorgeous.That being said, I'd like to point out that I enjoyed the movie for what it was - charming and endearing - but it was definitely not what I expected or wanted. A bit too simple and one dimensional for what I hoped would be a big wondrous adventure. Mr Hugh Grant steals the movie for me, also wanted more of Mr Atkinson. Good performances all around. While I am a Chalamet aficionado, I simply wasn't into the story as much as I thought I'd be. So I will be waiting patiently for Dune Part II. As it is now, I can't rate Wonka higher than a 7.",

Tom Davis in a lederhosen and a mini silk kimono holding a tiny tea cup and saucer will continue to make me chuckle... brilliant. Paul King and Simon Farnaby's script is perfection for me re the details of the jokes and characters, it just made me smile from ear to ear. The literalness of Matt Lucas's character, the heaving at the word poor by Mathew Baynton... I think this film is definitely for adults... children will like the music and the giraffe but the adults will enjoy the sublime humour. A feel good movie for all. And no it doesn't matter that Wonka is not yet the jaded eccentric Wonka of the Gene Wilder film. Chamalet smashes it out of the park. More from Paul King and Simon Farnaby pls.",
    "51": "A very enjoyable film from a surprisingly big name cast. It doesn't pretend to be near the same film as with Gene Wilder, but the influence is clear throughout and executed perfectly for a modern Wonka film. The new songs are very fun, the story interesting, very 'Matilda-ish' which I guess you'd of course expect from a Roald Dahl story.There is the odd moment where the film feels a little bit slow, perhaps a song that's bit too long, but the film keeps a good pace.I doubt all the singing by Timothée was entirely his own, but the aura and warmth he brought to Wonka's character is something we have missed in previous film renditions.In conclusion, a fun and light hearted family film that all can enjoy, just make sure you watch it with some chocolate in hand!",
    "52": "I enjoyed the film, it was definitely made with love but, I think, too much love for the original film, restricting how far the film could have gone.Hugh Grant was very underused, though a great addition to the film. The main performance from Timothée Chalamet was energetic and exciting, as are his interactions with the rest of the cast.The antagonists are fun but the effort they go to, to destroy Wonka, seems very illogical but they gave some of the best laughs of the film.The film generally looks great, though it feels quite drained of colour.All around the performances made the film worth watching, the chemistry between Chalamet and Calah Lane being a highlight as the characters bounce off eachother so wonderfully.Absolutely worth at least a watch for the musical numbers alone, which I have not yet mentioned but not one bad song. The scale of these musical numbers is much smaller than most musicals, staying on the ground and personal, instead of doing grandiose showstoppers.",

We loved every second of it spent most the evening nudging each other when referencing the original.

Willy wants to open a chocolate store and has to overcome a few obstacles.The story is wonderfully quirky, as we know it from the previous films in this universe. The characters and setting also fit perfectly and Hugh Grant is excellent as Oompa Loompa. Unfortunately, the development of the supporting characters was minimal and the story doesn't fit perfectly with the other films. I didn't see the movie in the original version, so the synchro/sound of the singing wasn't that great.Hopefully we will see more of these movies.",
    "56": "Saw this at the cinema yesterday, and if I have to revoew this in one word, its gotta be \"surprising\". Despite a predictable story, Wonka is a suprisingly good prequel spin-off film that is sure to delight audiences of all ages, especially young kids. Timothee Chalamet is an incredible actor. He was the right person to portray young Willy Wonka imo. The songs are ok, the dances and acting are quite energetic, the story is mostly original, and the jokes land really well. The antagonists are also funny and Im not sure which character in this movie is the standout. Despite it being a comedy, it is often emotional. If you have a very young child or sibling, take them to see this movie, they will no doubt have the time of their life and will like it more than me (or you). Some small gripes I have with this movie is that the antagonists (including Slugworth, Prodnose, and Fickelgruber) don't look or act ruthless or intimidating, maybe excpet Scrubbit and Bleacher, and some great chracters don't serve a big purpsose to the story and are just there for comedy, including the Priest and Oompa-lompa, who might be an exception at the final few seconds of film.",
    "57": "What a great film for all the family. Special recognition must go to Tom Davis in his role as Bleacher. I would love to see him nominated for a best supporting actor in this seasons awards.I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances, the music and the special effects. I was lost in the magic of it all. I giggled throughout along with an audience of other like minded adults on a mid morning screening with no children in sight. Simon Farnaby the co writer deserves a mention too. A great adaptation of the original story by one of the best children's authors was brought to life in a magical origin story of Willy Wonka. Makes me want to watch the Gene Wilder film all over again.",

Great British cast even my 10 year old daughter recognised lots of them and there were a lot of very funny moments. The music wasn't too much either, when I first started I thought it was going to be quite full on but all the music was great we all left singing the last song!It was much better than the weird Jonny Depp one that came out years ago. It told a story very well and the ending really made it feel like it was the beginning of the original story it all tied in really well.",

However, watching the songs in the movie was a different experience.The humor is not the laugh out loud kind but still made me chuckle here and there. There were some poignant parts, some adventure, some excitement. The set was colorful. There were of course absurd parts, quite reminiscent to some of other Roald Dahl's works, like Matilda for instance, which was magical and filled me with wonder and joy. Wonka did feel a lot like one of his works. I think Dahl would have approved of this.I came home and watched Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. But I must say I enjoyed Wonka better...",

There was some fantastic dialogues..I can't remember all of them now but..few which I could were \" All good things in this world started with a dream, don't give up on yours. 😊😊😍😍.",
    "61": "I got spellbound apart from a little bit of plot armour and the child actor not being as a scratch the rest of the cast the film was impeccable. I didn't expect to enjoy musical that much, however, I was smiling throughout the whole viewing and even left at some of the bits, which I don't usually do with most films.There's bits you can predict and the story isn't mega complicated. However, it just hits you in the feelings and is so stupidly enjoyable because of how weird the and crazy some of the concepts are likethat chocolate can make tou do these insane thingsI'd happily watch it again.",
    "62": "I didn't catch any trailers for this movie, so when it started, I was pleasantly surprised by the awesome music and Timothy's talent. The whole musical vibe worked well, and all the songs were just pure joy, making me feel pumped and even teary-eyed. It took me back to the movies I loved in the 2000s, giving me those nostalgic teen vibes.In a world filled with chaos, we all need more of these feel-good flicks to keep hope alive. The script was fun, and the characters like Road Dhal, were great. Wonka's personality felt real, not too out there, and Timothy's take on it was spot-on. There were hints of the Depp version, but he definitely put his own spin on it. The whole chocolate-making motivation was surprisingly beautiful-simple yet something we can all relate to in our lives. I loved it, and seriously, we could use more of these kinds of movies. 🍫✨",
    "63": "Wonka feels like a breath of fresh air, while you must be tired watching actions, thrillers and horror, this Paul King's fictional musical world would make you believe in miracles🌌🌈.Story : The story starts on Willy Wonka arriving in the chocolate city with the dream to be the best chocolatier in the world. With just a few sovereigns in his pocket upon arrival and losing them in the next 2 mins, the story sets the foundation for Willy being a kind-hearted yet silly chocolatier.Before selling his chocolates he also needs to deal with the Chocolate Cartel. To accompany him on his journey to become the best chocolatier, he finds some amazing friends. How Wonka meets them is something you need to watch in the movie.Performances : Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp were the original Wonka's for any 80s/90s children. When Timothee Chalamet was announced for the role, I was a bit hesitant accepting him as Wonka. However, the Dune star looks so good and brings honesty to his character, he never tries to imitate the previous Wonka's but rather sets up his own benchmark, he is optimistic, kind and honest about his chocolates - exactly the WONKA we needed.Calah Lane as Noodle also shines as Wonka's partner in crime, she has lots of potential as an artist.The remaining cast also looks really good and everyone does justice to their roles.Direction : The paddington director has already proven that he understands family entertainment. With Wonka he further cements his base by creating a musical family entertainment , the screenplay just flows like a river without any lazy writing, the movie keeps the audiences engaged. Paul also layers the film with relationship that Wonka and Noodle develop, which might bring tears to your eyes, the cinematography works well, especially during the musical parts with a very polished VFX, humour feels authentic and would make you laugh out loud, can't find a single thing that Paul could have done better, it was all perfect.Music : This is one of the biggest strength for Wonka, half of the story moves with songs attached to it and that could have dipped the screenplay but rather it makes the story even shine further because the songs are more of a melody/lullaby that helps you relax and are so peaceful to the ears, big thumbs up to the musical team.Goods/Bads : There is nothing bad in this miraculous film, everything is over the top, you'll love this fantasy world, your kids will love it, your parent will love it - a movie for every generation. It's a perfect holiday movie we all needed. Wonka was never a movie anyone would've asked, but thank you, Paul King, for this, go watch it on the biggest screen, just if it could have been made in 3D it would have looked even more beautiful, but nevertheless it is hands down the best family entertainer for the year.",
    "64": "Wonka is a cracking film that took me back to nostalgia of the 1971 original. The new Wonka actor is pure class and I felt I was watching a young Gene Wilder. The way he spoke and moved was great.Forgetting the terrible Jonny Depp version this is full of great characters and warmth.The only downside was Matt Lucas and his character. Super irritating and very 1 dimensional.The songs were pretty decent but not as catchy as the original but there was loads of the classic music throughout the film which gave me goose pimples.Definitely worth a visit, you'll leave the cinema happy and humming.",
    "65": "Is it the best directed movie with the best acting of the year and the most clever story? Of course not, but it made me feel like a child and I caught myself smiling through most of the songs. After the movie I bought a box of chocolate and went to my parents house to share them with, this movie will always have a place in my heart for the way it made feel.The songs are catchy and do not overextend which can often happen in musicals. The film felt like it had good pacing throughout it except for some scenes in the 3 act that maybe would have been better cutting. Overall it's a good movie to watch with the family that will make you have a good time and feel good after watching!",
    "66": "Oompa Loompa loompa di doo,\nI got an honest review for you,Wonka, they have the right track for the movie. They chose to follow the choices of the original movie from '71 and I think that was a great choice. The constant references to that movie was a bit annoying after a while. It's like telling a joke too much that everyone gets bored with it at some moment.The plot is ok, but again not that special. A classic story of someone trying to make success, but fails initially. The world doesn't accept him and abuses Wonka for being naive. He meets a girl in a leeching 'inn' that seems to be an orphan that is way more important than it seems initially. The owners could be a Dahl's invention, but somehow miss to be creepy enough. They are terrible, but not tyrannical.The chocolate cartel seems to run the city and try to keep it that way. The competitors are quite fun to see, but somehow miss some extra layers of character. They're baddies, you know it, and that's it. No back stories, no complexity, except the main baddy, that has an extra side story, but that's it. Again well played, but misses the extra.The story goes on how Wonka just defies his fate at the inn and does his magic with chocolate. He helps the people trapped in there as well to make his dream come true and out of good if his heart. They learn to loophole the system and start to make a name and fortune. Again a nice feelgood plot, but still misses the classic Dahl sinister side.In the end he will make his dream come true by defeating the chocolate cartel by making a plan to capture the financial book that noted all expenses of them and hand it over to the less corrupt agent in the police force. Wonka's name is cleared and he can make his dream come true to make the best chocolate in the world. Again quite Christmas spirited goodness.In the movie there is a storyline about the best chocolate in the world and how to make it. Wonka was from poor decendancy and the one chocolate bar he got from his mother at his birthday (another reference to the original movie, my goodness, they don't stop coming), is the lead why he wants to do this. She promises to be there when she tells her secret why it's the best chocolate when the time is ripe. That promise is kept at the very end of the movie (cliché). It's a good insight of where he came from and where his ambitions are rooted, but yet again a bit too straight forward and without lifes troubles.The oompa loompa line... It's funny and sincerely brought, but they went a bit safe with it in my opinion. How many times they reference to the '71 film (quite amusing with the dances they did), it still feels that the orange little men aren't done full right. In the books of Dahl they have a quite dark history and you don't feel it in this movie. Again the right zest, but still not the spice. The actor is brilliant though and his character is a star in the movie.Choice of actors: I can only say: well done! They made the right choices along the cast. All did brilliantly in the boundaries of the script.Songs... I'm not a fan of songs in movies or musicals. They ruin the speed of a movie. I get that it's the point of a musical, but they are drags mostly. Where in the '71 movie the songs were an addition to the stories, here they are just references and drags. Although I have to say there are less songs than could have been, so a small plus for that?The setting: it feels like a legit city, but somehow, it feels restricted to the chocolate retailers who own it and the citizens are just that. It even doesn't have a name (or I missed it). It feels just like there is nothing going on there, except being expensive to live there and penny pinchers everywhere. The Dahl feel is there though (and do I taste a bit of Dickens?) And it functions for the story. Clothing is also ok.To sum it up: a fun movie to watch, a good ode to the original movie, but had more potential to go a level up though. Good acting, a bit of a lacking plot and some safe choices to make it watchable for kids, I guess? 7/10 is a well earned score.You can live in happiness too,\nLike the oompa loompa loompa dee do!",
    "67": "What a beautiful story!! Magical and innovative. I actually think this was better than the original!! A wholesome warm movie for the whole family! Great actors, humorous with emotion too. I was not expecting such a great film. There hasn't been much hype about this film, unlike other movies. I think that's why I was so pleasantly surprised by it. I never do reviews but I felt I had to with this movie. I'm tempted to go and watch it again! Let's hope there is a sequel. I will definitely be keeping an eye open for it. The songs are catchy and my daughter has come home singing them. Go and see it, you won't be disappointed.",
    "68": "I went into this, with the worlds of Roald Dahl written into my psyche. My own art is made of fabric woven with threads from his stories. Wonka, like others has been done before, and I wasn't expecting to be swept away.What did I just watch?! I knew from the first 60 seconds that it was going to be nothing like I had imagined, and till the end I was delighted again and again. The soundtrack is sprinkled with the best parts of the original film, and the remainder stands tall next to them.Well done all. I wish I was a child again, so I could watch this with child's eyes. Even as I am, I was captivated.",
    "69": "Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder.",
    "70": "On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timothée Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout.",
    "71": "Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timothée Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10.",
    "72": "Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10.",
    "73": "Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timothée Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be \"hip\" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",
    "74": "As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you.",
    "75": "I expected sooo much more from Wonka. Charlie and the Chocolate factory was my favourite book in my childhood, I watched both movies many times and my kids took that passion from me and my wife. We were looking forward to see Wonka, but then we were all disappointed.Movies is not bad, it's fairly entertaining, kids liked it, but we all agreed it's nowhere close to Tim Burton's movie. There was huge potential to bring some new magic into the chocolate world of Willy Wonka, but they failed to do that.During the movie, I never once felt the irresistible craving for chocolate, even though I'm a big fan of sweets. That's an unforgivable mistake. In Burton's film, I enjoyed the world of chocolate, from the beginning until the end. Also, the story is very average, focused mainly on the negative aspects of the world we live in. I don't know if they wanted to make a chocolate Oliver Twist, but the combination of the magical world of chocolate and the harsh realism of Charles Dickens just doesn't work together. I'm not dissatisfied with the film, but I am disappointed because it could and should have been much better, more magical, more appealing, and - tastier.",
    "76": "Wonka, the latest film from director Paul King, takes us on a journey into the fantastical world of Willy Wonka's early life. While the film is visually delightful and boasts a strong performance from Timothée Chalamet, its chaotic story and forgettable music leave it feeling bittersweet.Chalamet shines as a young Willy Wonka, brimming with youthful enthusiasm and boundless creativity. His performance is a welcome departure from the more jaded interpretations of the character, injecting a much-needed dose of innocence and wonder. Olivia Colman and Hugh Grant round out the cast with memorable supporting roles, adding humor and depth to the film.The film's greatest strength lies in its visual feast. The vibrant sets and costumes bring the Chocolate Factory to life in all its fantastical glory, creating a truly immersive experience for the audience. King's signature whimsical style shines through, crafting a lighthearted and enjoyable atmosphere that is sure to captivate children and adults alike.However, Wonka's charm is somewhat diminished by its chaotic story. The plot feels convoluted and lacks focus, making it difficult to follow at times. This is further exacerbated by the film's foray into musical territory. While the songs are visually stunning, they are unfortunately plagued by generic melodies and forgettable lyrics. They ultimately feel disconnected from the narrative, serving as unwelcome interruptions rather than emotional enhancements.While not quite reaching the heights of King's Paddington films, Wonka manages to entertain with its whimsical tone and charming performances. Fans of Chalamet and visually stunning musicals will likely find much to enjoy. However, those seeking a more focused and emotionally resonant experience may find themselves left wanting. Overall, Wonka is a visually delightful and whimsical film that ultimately feels like a mixed bag of treats, leaving one with a taste of both satisfaction and disappointment.",
    "77": "Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That \"edge\" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's \"Pure Imagination,\" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10.",
    "78": "I would suggest watching only the trailer and, with memories of what you may have seen and read before, let that light up a little \"Pure Imagination,\" and leave it there. Don't go and see this film.The musical is built around the \"Pure imagination\" track from the original movie, however hasn't done much in it's attempts to spring board from there, creating rather a drab and uninspired musical around that!They shouldn't have used that original song, not really, in that it appears to have revealed a considerable lack of musical talent, in so far as the new songs are concerned, within a musical production, in this case!The musical whimpered on throughout a meaningless story, it all felt rather uninspired, with consideration to what came before it, featuring not a single character of interest, going on to fizzle out leaving nothing at all. I'm struggling to write about it in fact, it being almost entirely forgettable.Timothy's Wonka, the character, is actually very good, as are some of the villains within this, however everything else simply fails to leave a mark. Some rather bad story telling in this one. I'm quite shocked about this to be honest!",
    "79": "In this latest film, it's clear that something vital is missing. Despite the commendable efforts of a talented cast, they struggle against a script that is both boring and predictable. Their performance, while earnest, cannot elevate the lackluster storyline.The music, often a redeeming feature in such films, sadly fails to deliver. It doesn't capture the audience's interest or invite participation. There's a noticeable lack of catchy tunes or engaging rhythms, making the musical aspect forgettable.Targeted at families, the film surprisingly doesn't resonate with children. The humor is limited and mostly revealed in the trailers, leaving little to be discovered in the theater. The sporadic laughs from the younger viewers are few and far between, indicating the film's failure to connect with its intended audience.A key element missing is the enchanting and quirky charm typically associated with \"Wonka movies.\" This film follows a too straightforward and mundane path, lacking the vibrancy and uniqueness that made previous films stand out. Overall, it's a disappointing experience that lacks the magic and personality needed to make it memorable.",
    "80": "Willy Wonka's origin story puts him in London, where he wants to make his long dream come true. With the most unique recipes, he quickly establishes himself as the best chocolate maker which irks the trio of the chocolate cartel. They want him gone in order to have their monopoly. How Wonka finds his unlikely family in London, who support him to make his dream turn into reality as well as take on the trio of villains forms rest of the story.This musical aims to establish this as a sweet film right with Wonka's introduction in the opening credits and it succeeds in that. Atleast 3 songs stood out and the back story to Noodles provide the much needed drama. There is also Wonka's bonding with his own mother. The songs compliment these emotions as well as the wacky ambition of the young chocolate maker. With the likes of Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Keegan-Michael Key in the supporting cast, makes it even easier in keeping the entertainment intact.The humor worked for me throughout and Timothee Chalamet brought some freshness with his take on the titular character. Calah Lane as Noodles was another standout character. The songs keep entertaining and so does the comedy scenes followed enough dose of drama without dragging the story. Ofcourse adult Wonka turned out to be quiet different and this film doesn't try to reveal anything about that, presenting Wonka as this sweetest boy learning to value relationship and succeeding in his dream to open a chocolate shop. It's a screenplay of convenience and there isn't much to complain.",
    "81": "As a child I grew up absolutely loving Gene Wilder in the role, I didn't care for Johnny Depp, that film was just too weird, along comes Chalamet, pretty good in the part, I just wasn't crazy about the film.I felt as though I was watching a musical somewhere in The West End, lots of musical numbers, and a plot which was there, but more so for the sake of it.1971's film presents us with a world of magic, what child (or adult for that matter) wouldn't have wanted to get into that factory, and didn't end up singing those songs, sadly there's none of that here. It's very well made, it's well acted, all that's missing is the magic.I know I shouldn't be comparing it to the past, it's better than the Depp movie, but not a patch on Wilder's.",

Definitely.Do musicals recall you good old times with your acquaIntances? Absolutely.Ladies and gentlemen, that's 'Wonka'! A brilliant movie filled with magic. Chalamet delivers a wonderful performance, whose range of acting hugely widens with this role, from a 1920s clown like Chaplin to a 1950s charming dancer like Gene Kelly.I was especially delighted with the city's atmosphere, it's a Victorian London-like city. It's clear that Paul King knows how to bottle Christmas essence, mixing grayish pedestrian streets and brick buildings with goldish open malls. Watching this movie takes you back to the time when you were a child, and you walked hand in hand with your parents watching extravagant shopwindows displaying the finest products on Christmas.And what about the music? It's perfect! 'Oompah Loompah doompety do' won't get out of your head besides the fancy choreographies, every detail and nuance conveys a Christmas ambience. You can even taste the chocolate, slip with the iced flor covered in snow, smell the chestnuts, notice the smoke from the chimneys...\nFinally, we're not even un mid-December ans \"it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\" so please get yourself a hot chocolate mug get together with family and enjoy watching 'Wonka' because it will become a Christmas classic.",

Give the Oscars to them both already.The production design and art direction provide a dazzling visual feast, so just sit back and enjoy the ride.For better or worse, Willy Wonka here is presented as sweet and warm and lovable although we know him as a much darker personality as played by Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp in the films based on Roald Dahl's book. This is the back story, so I guess he started off more innocently. But I still can't get over Timothee Chalamet's absolutely flawless performance. In this very challenging role which includes singing, his speech and demeanor are pitch perfect.So happy to end this dismal year on such a fabulous note!",

The story was not interesting, by making Wonka kind of secret in the original is what made it magical and interesting, Willy Wonka didn't need any back story.The songs weren't as good as they were in the original they seemed plain and unthoughtful.The giraffe milk was odd bd stupid.The cast was ok I guess, a few familiar faces, Roman Atkinson and Matt Lucas, was nice to see them on screen I guess, but apart from that this prequel was nothing special and it definitely wasn't needed.Take my advise avoiddddd.",
    "85": "\"Wonka\" is a musical fantasy film that serves as an origin story of the character of Willy Wonka from the novel \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" by Roald Dahl. Directed by Paul King (\"Paddington\" 1 and 2) and starring Timothée Chalamet in the lead role, it is a whimsical, fun film that captures the spirit of Roald Dahl and is sure to entertain the younger crowd.In an unnamed European town, inventor and magician Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) arrives to fulfil his childhood dream of running his own chocolate shop. Searching for a place to stay, Wonka stumbles upon a laundromat run by the suspicious Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Colman), who offers him a room so long as he signs a contract. After failing to read the fine print, Wonka finds himself in debt to Mrs. Scrubbit and is forced to work around the clock to earn his freedom. While labouring away, Wonka meets five other people who are also indebted to Mrs. Scrubbit's contract; young orphan Noodle (Calah Lane), plumber Piper (Natasha Rothwell), accountant Abacus (Jim Carter), phone operator Lottie (Rakhee Thakrar), and comedian Larry (Rich Fulcher). The five prisoners inform Wonka that the city is controlled by the \"Chocolate Cartel\", a trio of greedy chocolate makers - Mr. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Mr. Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Mr. Fickelgruber (Mathew Boynton) - who are fiercely determined to eliminate any potential competition. Wonka teams up with his five new friends to hatch a scheme to bring down the cartel and make his chocolate available to everyone no matter their financial situation.One of the most popular children's stories of the twentieth century is Roald Dahl's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", the timeless tale of a young boy named Charlie Bucket who is given the opportunity to meet the eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka and visit his mysterious chocolate factory. Since it was first published back in 1964, the story has become a favourite among children the world over, with many like myself growing up reading it at school. Further cementing the story's popularity was the 1971 film adaptation \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" and to a lesser extent Tim Burton's 2005 film \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". Regardless of which of the two films you prefer, their success at the box office proves that the story is as renowned as it ever was, with the character of Willy Wonka attracting the most attention due to his quirky personality. The 2023 film \"Wonka\" gives us an origin story of the title character in a movie that should keep both children and adults entertained for most of the time.Although I'm not entirely sure if we needed to know about the origins of Willy Wonka, this film shows just barely enough about him to still retain that necessary air of mystery without completely ruining his character. When we first meet the young Wonka, he is shown to be ambitious about opening a chocolate shop, singing his passion for the sweet treat loudly from high atop a ship's mast. Upon arriving at his destination, Wonka learns to his dismay that this place is dreary, depressing, and has little time for fun-loving individuals like himself. In fact, no less than three minutes later, Wonka is even forced to pay a fine for daydreaming out in public. Things take a turn for the worst when Wonka is essentially forced into slavery to pay off a huge debt due to his inability to read a contract's fine print as a result of his illiteracy.In spite of all his hardships, Wonka's spirit remains untarnished as he is determined to share his wondrous treats with the world, no matter who or what stands in his way. What I enjoyed here was how the film was able to balance Wonka's confident oddball personality with that of him being the underdog in a new town, staying true to himself but still acknowledging the uphill battle he has to succeed in this harsh world. This is an important message that people of all ages can learn from, since becoming successful is not always an easy task and doing so without sacrificing your own integrity is a challenge within itself. As a result, the otherwise off-putting Willy Wonka becomes a relatable character the audience can find themselves identifying with.Being a musical, there are numerous moments in the film where characters break into song whenever it is necessary for them to communicate their inner monologues. While the songs were all fine and served their intended purpose, I found that most of them weren't all that memorable. The one original musical number I liked the most was near the beginning, where Wonka learns about the fates of his five co-workers/prisoners and how they are doomed to \"Scrub Scrub\" until all their debts are paid. The reason I enjoyed this the most was because it is done in the most Roald Dahl way possible, complete with word play, dark humour, and crackpot villains.Additionally, there are also some variations on the classic tunes from the 1971 film. For instance, the \"Oompa Loompa\" song makes not one but two appearances here, sung by an Oompa Loompa named Lofty (Hugh Grant). Instead of singing about misbehaving children, Lofty sings about why he is no longer welcome among his peers, which is both sad and funny once you learn the actual reason. The older viewers might appreciate the callbacks to the original \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" film and I'm certain the younger viewers will like the newer songs, but I can't really see any of them getting stuck in people's heads once the movie has finished.As the title character, I liked the youthful spin Timothée Chalamet was able to add to an already exceptionally outlandish individual. His take on Willy Wonka is that of an experienced young man who seems ready to take on the world, only to find that not everyone is there to support him in his endeavours. Chalamet's Wonka seems to be unique among his predecessors in that he does not seem to be the younger version of either one, although he does show some of the condescending traits of Gene Wilder's version and the melancholic insecurities of Johnny Depp's version. This almost seems like a compromise of sorts, as though the filmmakers tried to combine both Wilder's and Depp's Wonkas into one so as not to alienate the fans too much. I would say this does work for the most part, however, I personally think they should have just picked one and gone with that instead.Most of the supporting cast were quite good, especially Wonka's five co-workers turned friends who assist him on his mission. With that in mind, Noodle is clearly the main one out of the five that receives the most attention in the story. Although I did like the idea of her being Wonka's street smart friend, I think there was one important thing about her character that is never explained. Early in the film, we learn that Wonka is illiterate, struggling to comprehend even single letters of the alphabet, which is where Noodle comes in to teach him how to read. Being an orphan who never went to school, how did Noodle become intelligent enough to be able to educate a grown man on the basics of reading and writing? We never find out how she acquired this level of education, so this seems like a major plot hole the movie glosses over. I'm not sure if this is the film's way of saying children are sometimes smarter than adults, but it would have been nice to have been provided some explanation as to how an orphan raised on the streets is capable of teaching an adult man comprehensive English skills.I thought the three main villains were rather amusing at times, but Mr. Slugworth is clearly the leader of the trio. Slugworth is shown to be the brains of this whole operation, which is established by the firm, aggressive handshake he gives to everyone he meets. This film treats him and his two colleagues as though they are running some kind of narcotics ring, only with chocolate instead of drugs. I suppose this would make Slugworth the Gus Fring of chocolatiering, which is made evident by his widespread infamy over the entire town. On that note, I just wish we could have seen more of Mr. Prodnose's and Mr. Fickelgruber's intimidating influence throughout the story. It just seems like all of Matt Lucas's and Mathew Baynton's comedic talents are going to waste here, as their characters serve little purpose other than to agree with everything Slugworth says.Though far from essential viewing, \"Wonka\" still serves its purpose as an enjoyable origin story of the most famous fictional chocolate maker in all of children's literature. It may not instil the same level of wonder as the other two feature films before it, but it provides just enough entertainment for a casual viewing with the whole family. Had the film placed more focus on developing its supporting cast and fixing some plot holes, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Still, you could definitely do a whole lot worse than what we got so all I can say is just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.I rate it 7/10.",
    "86": "When I saw Paul King (who has done a wonderful job with the Paddington films) was directing the new Wonka a film I must admit I was a little optimistic. But sadly rather than seeing a world of pure imagination it really was a world of pure disappointment.Timothee Chalamet had big shoes to fill, following on from the late great Gene Wilder and living legend Johnny Depp in portraying the titular zany choclatier. Sadly he does not have the charisma of either. It was frustrating that he didn't show any of the crankiness or attitude which made Gene Wilder's version of Wonka so brilliant, instead he's presented as a naive dreamer.As a musical, the songs were so mediocre, I can't imagine the kids will remember any of them once they've left the cinema, barring the ones we've heard before in the other films. The film would have been less tiresome if they had skipped many of these songs.At one point during the film I looked at my watch hopeful that there wasn't too much of the film left, yet it turned out it had only been on for 45 minutes at this point and it still had over an hour to go, I literally couldn't comprehend how that first 45 minutes had felt so much longer.If I can say one nice thing, it's that Olivia Coleman, Paterson Joseph and Rich Fulcher were the hilights and helped make the 2 hour slog just about bearable.",
    "87": "It's a decent origin story about the character of Willy Wonka with good performances, beautiful production, musical tracks, and some good humor. Director Paul King, known for his works on Paddington 1 and 2, does a solid role in handling the setting and themes. The production, color presentations, and the sound designs are great with some good visuals effects and style. All the performances are pretty good as Timothée Chalamet, Calah Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Grant and the rest of the cast members are all fun to observe. Rowan Atkinson is always a blast to see.The narrative is standard and King does try to provide some new interesting elements and style to the story and characters and there are some concepts that worked and some that could have been better. On the humor and singing, there are some good singing moments from the cast members and the humor was solid, although some humorous moments felt flat. The character of Willy Wonka is fun to observe but the other characters weren't really that investing or emotionally engaging to connect with. Some dialogue moments could be better.While it's not amazing, the pacing was good and I was still invested to see where the movie was heading. Overall, it's definitely not the best movie from Paul King but it's still entertaining with fun visuals and a good time to watch for the Christmas Season. Now time to eat some chocolate.",
    "88": "As in chocolate and ing ... well something. Anyway, no pun intended. And a musical again - you may say, like I did. Not really something I was looking forward to. And yet the movie got to me ... it really is a feel good movie and it really works. With all the ridiculous and enhancements and caricatures it is drawing. I mean talk about evil ... it relishes in it! The actors turn it up to 11 more than once.But they know what they are doing - they do not have to be reigned in. No sir - although I assume the director had a leash on some of the things ... he had to have, right? Considering all the small details added to the movie I will go ahead and say yes.While I was a bit skeptic, the movie had me quite early. Yes you could make cases about how \"kid friendly\" this is (stunts from the start, as in do not try this at home, riding on top of a car, jumping of it), but it is quite clear that the movie is fantasy. And I think kids can tell too, without wanting to do things they see ... and arent't we all addicted to chocolate already? I'd say the answer is quite ... well revealing ... I mean obvious! Also you get to see one character change physically ... so there is that too.This may be too sweet ... if there is such a thing ... and a pun you would be able to forgive ... now on to watch the 70s movie soon ... never got around to that ... until now, this being a prequel, it should work nicely.",
    "89": "'' Wonka '' is a musical taking inspiration of the 1971 version of the book adaption of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, serving as a prequel to the well known story. And trully, King does what King did in Pandington: give a heartwarming, enjoyable fairtale that pleases both adult and younger audiences.First of all, the songs were enjoyable, well performed, with entertaining dancing sequences, and witty lyrics. The costumes and CGI were all great as well, creating the right atmosphere for the story to be properly unfold.As for the story itself, it is pleasant, though, some scenes were a bit too much and a bit cheesy, and the progress of the plot was predictable as well. But the overall result was entertaining and heartwarming.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.",
    "90": "Years after Gene Wilder brought Willy Wonka to the big screen for the first time and after Johnny Depp played him, now the beloved chocolatier returns to recount his beginnings before creating the chocolate factory. The film tells a charming story that manages to maintain the essence of the 1971 film and update it in an excellent way. He presents us with an innocent and charming Willy Wonka who has that charisma and eccentricity that so characterizes the character. The movie shows Willy as a kind of magician and that's what he's always been since he first appeared in Roald Dahl's book or the original movie. Without a doubt, the actor manages to maintain the eccentricity of the character. Hugh Grant plays the first Oompa-Loompa that Willy met and the way he embodies this peculiar character is wonderful, making him striking. Even though short real actors were used in the original film and CGI was used here, they managed to keep the Oompa-Loompa's appearance and quirkiness intact. The film's musical numbers are a work of art and have the feel of the original film's soundtrack, making the musical scenes masterful. It is quite appreciated that some parts of the original soundtrack were also used. The acting, the production, the special effects, literally everything in this film is excellent, managing to respect the vision of the source of origin and making it a worthy successor to Dahl's work for perfectly capturing its magic. Wonka is definitely one of the best prequels in cinema history and a beautiful film to enjoy with the whole family. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.",
    "91": "Wonka is an amazing piece of entertainment reminiscent of old Hollywood when spectacle and awe truly meant something.The secret is that it is a cartoon made in live action. The tone, the musicality, the over-the-top acting and characters, everything has the sweetness and joy of an animated movie.The story is the emotional and musical journey of a very naive but smart character in the true spirit of Roal Dahl. It blends humor, drama and a baroque sense of insanity that wraps you with childlike excitement.Timothée Chalamet nails the complex Wonka by playing it in all seriousness and embracing the silliness like a male Mary Poppins.Paul King uses the 1940s love of dramatic shots, crazy colors and retro choreographies to fill his movie with fascinating set pieces. The shop scene is fabulous and just an example of the incredible attention to details : the right combination of digital and reality. Disney could learn a thing or two from it. Of course if you're familiar with the Paddington movies you will recognize story beats, aesthetic elements and an obsession with heist scenarios but it works for the best. As an incredible rollercoaster of old school fun,\nWonka will melt your heart.",
    "92": "Enjoyed this!2023's 'Wonka' is very good! It's an original story based upon the Roald Dahl novel, so it isn't an adaptation as such like the 1971 and 2005 flicks. With that I didn't find it quite as interesting as what's portrayed in the aforementioned films, but I do appreciate (and prefer, tbh) that they went a different way with it here. And it comes out nicely.Timothée Chalamet gives a strong performance in the lead role. Those behind Chalamet are entertaining, from Calah Lane to Keegan-Michael Key to the trio of Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton - the latter three's dance number for the Chief of Police near the beginning is amusing. The musical elements in general are solid.Tom Davis and Olivia Colman are fun too. All characters played by those mentioned above after Lane could've easily have been extremely cringey, but thankfully I didn't find that to be the case for any of them at all - very well written, shown and cast in that regard.Someone I have yet to mention is a certain someone as Lofty, an Oompa-Loompa. Hugh Grant is excellent as the orange-skinned, green-haired fellow, even if they did use Grant's best bits in the trailers; which I usually avoid due to those sort of (albeit minor) spoilers, but evidently failed to do so here.All in all, I'd say this is a success. Credit to them for delivering, especially as I was kinda nonplussed by the already noted trailers (Grant aside).",
    "93": "What is wrong with people nowadays, why all the bad reviews?!This movie is fantastic!The music is excellently crafted and perfectly performed by all.The humour is brilliant, I have never been in a cinema where everyone has laughed out loud, not just children but fully grown adults as well, laughing at a \"children's film\", as I keep seeing in a lot of the reviews on here saying.In my opinion there is no such thing as a children's film but instead films that are appropriate for children to watch but ultimately are for everyone to enjoy.It is my belief that \"grownups\" need to calm down and realise that not every film needs to be a gritty drama, blockbuster saga or a dirty comedy to be considered a great movie for adults to enjoy, let your guard down and just enjoy films like you used to before we all became adults with a singular cynical view of the world why can't we just be happy with lighthearted musical movies, why must we bash them just because its seems to be the way to keep within the in crowd.This movie had me crying with pure joy, with moments of sadness, and with the sheer lyrical talent coupled with the musical brilliance of this movie musical that we haven't seen the likes of in decades!Please ignore the negative reviews and let yourself enjoy this brilliant film uninhabited by what types of films you \"should\" enjoy.",
    "94": "I've always liked Timothee Chalamet's performances. Even when he did things exceptionally, it felt like he was really good at that but still not enough for me to love him as an actor. There's a certain charm that I find in actors I grow to love and I found that in him here. Chalamet is brilliant as well as the rest of the cast. I didn't know Olivia Coleman was in this, and even though I recognized her face, I couldn't place her. She looks much younger here as the evil Mrs. Scrubbit and have a completely different body language that I couldn't place her till the credits came on screen, brilliant. Paul King has made this as sweet and optimistic as the Paddington films, even though it does have the darkness of the Wonka world. The movie doesn't dwell on those dark moments, it quickly follows them up with optimism. The songs were great and the older songs used were such fantastic placements. Willy Wonka is yet to be truly betrayed by people and he has the innocence and purity here and that works perfectly. Whatever problems I had must be things that aren't even part of what they meant to tell through this movie. This worked fantastically as a prequel to the 1971 movie.",
    "95": "My Review- Wonka\nMy Score 6/10I don't mind sequels and prequels if they achieve something original or unique but I felt that Roald Dahl would have been totally unimpressed with this cliche overload musical confectionery.I'm a lover of musicals and great children's stories but not this movie in fact as much as I enjoyed Timothée Chalamet's characterisation of young Willy Wonker pre his Chocolate factory I was bored .Even though at times some of the musical numbers are spectacular I kept thinking this is just another attempt to make a cash cow out of an iconic character .I kept thinking I've seen this character before they are just borrowing from old musicals like Oliver or Annie .The plot is very different to Roald Dahl's backstory to Willy Wonker who he wrote was the son of his hometown's local dentist, Dr. Wilbur Wonka. This unfortunately made Willy not allowed to eat chocolate and sweets, and he eventually ran away from home, later starting up his chocolate business from a single shop to a gigantic factory.In this Wonker movie Willy is an aspiring magician, inventor and chocolatier who arrives by boat to an unnamed European city to fulfil his dream of opening his chocolate shop at the Galeries Gourmet. He decides to stay at a laundromat after he becomes penniless where he meets the devious Mrs. Scrubbit and her henchman Bleacher who run a sweatshop laundry exploiting their workers.The three other villains are three chocolatiers named Mr. Slugworth, Mr. Prodnose and Mr. Fickelgruber who mock Wonka's chocolates .They scheme together and call the corrupt Chief of Police to confiscate Willy's earnings for the day and continue to thwart his ambitions which if realised would ruin theirs.Wonka is another huge budget movie estimated at $125 million which may or may not succeed I hope it does but it didn't with me and I really wonder what audience demographic this movie is aimed at ?I doubt it would entertain or hold the interest of children under 13 and I also doubt anyone over that age would get much entertainment out of it other than some good performances and a star studded cast.I enjoyed the 2 Paddington movies that Simon Farnaby and Paul King who also is the director of Wonker made but I feel have missed the mark in this movie .To many new characters come flying in and out in all directions but don't seem to add much to the story . Perhaps it just that Roald Dahl had said it all in 1964 in his novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which has already been adapted as a stage musical book by David Greig, music by Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Mark Shaiman and Scott Wittman.Joby Talbot the composer of Wonka has written a few good songs for the movie but nothing that I'd say would be remembered certainly no where near quality of the Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley score for Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory which produced The Candy Man and Pure Imagination which is also used in the finale of Wonker.The ensemble cast is impressive and full of big names like Olivia Colman as Mrs Scrubbit , Matt Lucas as Prodnose , Hugh Grant as Oopa Loompa Guard 1, Sally Hawkins as Willy\nWonka's mum ,Rowan Atkinson as Father Julius and Jim Carter as Abscus Crunch.They are all fun to watch for a while but I found the overall experience of Wonka irritating.Unlike the superb 2018 sequel to Mary Poppins Mary Poppins Returns Wonka for me added nothing to the wonderful Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory movie of 1971 starring Gene Wilder .However I will say top marks to Timothée Chalamet who impresses me more and more in his movie career. He is worth seeing in this movie as he sings and dances giving an elfish charm to his character in what for me is a lacklustre movie.This chocoholic got saccharine overload in a movie with to many bright wrappers and to many soft centres.",
    "96": "Just got back from this on its opening release date with my Mom! I absolutely ADORED it!!!The story: Willy Wonka, a magician/inventor/chocolatier arrives in an old English city with a happy hopeful dream: selling chocolate and spreading magic and happiness to all of the townsfolk! However, three other pride and greed infested chocolatiers, Ficklegruber, Prodnose, and Slugworth (collectively knows as The Chocolate Cartel) are instantly consumed with jealousy and annoyance at Wonka's work, and decide to try and crush his dreams. Luckily, with a group of wishy-washy washers from a hard labored laundry business, Wonka might have just the friends he needs to succeed, and make his Mama proud!The cast was an excellent, interesting choice of actors; each actor had the perfect mood to fit their character in different situations in the film. I enjoyed Timothee Chalamet, Hugh Grant, and Olivia Colman's performances the best; they really made me laugh!The film had a nice lighthearted, cheery, and humorous tone to it. A little something for adults, and children. I felt constant giddiness throughout the film! Sets and effects were pretty neat as well. The musical numbers, were outstanding! For each situation in the film, there was an excellent song to go with it! My favorite songs were \"You've never had a Chocolate like This\", and \"A World of your Own\". Plus, as respect payment for the 1971 version, the Oompa-Loompa song, and \"Pure Imagination\" were also featured, with brand new clever lyrics!Overall, this was one of the most happy, funny, exciting, descriptive, detailed, and clever musicals I've ever seen!! I've never felt such giddiness, joy, cheerfulness, and happiness at the movie theater before!! I actually felt like I was a kid again, skipping down the theater steps with my Mom, still singing \"A World of your Own\". I truly cherished Wonka! DON'T miss it!! And if you get the chance, take the kids along too! You'll all have a scrumdidilyumptiously delicious time!!",
    "97": "Just Got out of a Dolby Cinema Screening of WonkaAnother Perfect Watch (For Me)Here's my thoughts on the Film -1. 🎩 Timothy Chalamet as Willy Wonka.

    "98": "The book was a part of my childhood and I absolutely adored the film, watching whenever it was on TV... so it was very excited when I heard this was being made.I personally think Timothée Chalamet is a brilliant actor so my expectations were high and then my friend mentioned it was a musical and honestly my heart sank. The original works because it's old and of that time and as a child you feel differently about musicals. Now, I just find them a bit annoying and most have songs for songs sake. So as the first song started, I was more than ready to roll my eyes .... but it didn't happen. The songs were sweet, in-keeping with the story and they didn't feel over the top.Timothée absolutely shone as a yong Willy Wonka with his hat full of magic and hhis heart full of hopes and dreams. I felt his characterisation was perfect, confident but his belief in his craft spoke for itself... in the reaction from those tasting them. I honestly wanted to eat those Hoverchocs myself - A cherry and salted caramel marshmallow chocolate containing a microscopic hover-fly, the descriptions reminded me of the Roald Dahl book.I thought all the supporting actors were brilliant but I particularly loved Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa, a character I immediately connected to and it felt nostalgic to understand how Wonka first became acquainted with them.It's got everything you'd want from a feel good movie from a little injustice, the wonderfully awful villains, the hero and the help. I think this is going to be a huge success and a film I know I'll watch again and again.",
    "99": "Wonka joins a long line of IP that is being squeezed by the film industry as they try to eek out every last penny from recognisable names and brands. But does that mean that this film is just a lazy cash grab? Thankfully no.There is a magically charming quality to this film that warms the heart and puts a smile on the face. It is full of whimsy humour, over exaggerated characters and delightfully lyrical dialogue that all create a fun and engaging world to dive into. You can tell that care has been put into this film.It has a nice and breezy plot with some good character moments and decent momentum, even if it is a little overly sweet at times. I do also think it plays much more to its younger audience than its older one, and could have pushed some of the jokes and dialogue a little more to redress this balance. Overall the story is not particularly showstopping but it does the job.The cast is a veritable who's who of British comedy actors with some great bigger name cameos in there too. I do think the performances are a mixed bag but there are some great ones in here. Then there's the performance from Timothee Chalamet as Wonka, which I wasn't always convinced by. At times I loved it, but at others it feels a little cheesy (and not in the intentionally cheesy way that some of the other performances are).As a musical I was never truly convinced by any of the songs or any of the vocals. I'm writing this review shortly after watching the film and there are no melodies bouncing around my head that I can't shake. Usually after watching a musical I find at least one song to add to my playlist, but that isn't the case here.Ultimately I did like this film and it is a good time, but I think the brilliant tone and vibe cover up some of it's mediocrity. It has a good plot and a good lead performance, but there isn't much about this film that is amazing.",

I must prepare you. The end of this new 'Wonka' will take you right back to those same feelings you got watching the original for the first time. Prepare yourself to well up.Those first musical notes of 'Pure imagination' is transformative.Wonderful. Just wonderful.",
    "101": "This film is way too long.The concept has been done a million times before but better than this. The casting is adequate but none of them can really sing. The girl Noddy or whatever she's called was like a cardboard cutout, she really lacked something to make her part believable or to connect to the audience. Olivia Coleman played Olivia Coleman, she's really good at playing Olivia Coleman.The lead was ok, but that's all I can say. The storytelling was adequate and cinematography too but it's just \"meh\" from start to finish. It was all I could do to stay awake on a miserable UK day.Hugh Grant was washed out with CGI, in this day and age you'd think they'd be able to make things at least appear real.I wasted 40 quid on this rubbish.",
    "102": "WONKA is a huge surprise and a fun time at the movies. I didn't really expect much going in, besides King's attachment as director, but was surprised at how well-made this film is. It blends movie magic, well choreographed musical numbers, and a heartwarming story to make the perfect family film. Although I would've preferred a bit more moral and meaning to the story, Wonka delivers a feel-good experience and I enjoyed it a lot. It is just what it needs to be and subverts expectations. When I first heard about Chalamet's casting as the title character, I thought it wouldn't work, coming off of Dune (2021), but I was wrong. His charisma and joyous presence on screen made me realize his capability as an actor. All of the cast members were really good, but the main star of the film is director Paul King. He previously directed Paddington 1 and 2, two films my family and I really enjoyed, and was my only source of optimism for this film. He really knocked it out of the park with the way he handled the story and reassured my faith in him as a filmmaker. The way he handled the musical elements of the film were especially well done. Overall, this is one of the better films I've seen this year and deserves more attention.",
    "103": "I hardly ever used this word to describe movies but Wonka is absolutely delightful in almost every way. Honestly if someone watched it and told me they weren't at least charmed by it I might question their sanity. Sometimes it's just nice to have a film about good people doing good things with a really wholesome message and outlook on life and Wonka delivers all of that and then some.Timothée Chalamet is amazing in this movie, very few actors could emulate that overly whimsy style of humour that Gene Wilder perfected and he does it so perfectly. The way he plays this character is so unbelievably endearing with just the right amount of sentimentality and it never made me cringe once, quite the opposite in fact. He's just the head of a whole cast full of unbelievably likeable characters that ensure that this entire film is chock full of satisfying moments some of which even brought a tear to my eye as cheesy as it might sound.It really should come as no surprise how well produced this film is on a technical and script level considering the fact that it's the same man who brought about both the Paddington films. It's gorgeously shot, especially from a cinematography perspective, and I loved all of the musical sequences all of which I'm still playing in my head right now. It's laugh out loud funny with a lot more well rounded character moments than I ever would've expected. This clearly was not a pay check job for anyone involved and this is the kind of craft I would love to see more of in blockbuster movies.If I had to knock the film for a few things it would be that a lot of the stuff away from the Wonka character wasn't nearly as entertaining. All the villainous characters were over-the-top in all the right ways but they did start to wear out their welcome for me after a while. Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa is such a great concept and he is fantastic but he wasn't in the movie as much as I would've liked because he and Chalamet made such a great pair. I also think the film was starting to feel a little long by the time the 3rd act came around but I was having such a good time watching it that it didn't bother me too much.Wonka was far better than it had any right to be and I could absolutely see myself rewatching many more times. Chalamet is basically perfect and this role just goes to show how much range he has as an actor. I would fight back against anyone who thinks this is a corporate cash grab because the feeling it gave me is one very few other movies have given me all year. I think the best compliment I could give Wonka is that it's absolutely a movie I would show my kids one day.",
    "104": "Wonka's story in this film is very weakly based on the book, but they made something new, something we can call a prequel, but not exactly. It's a story on its own. The story that tells us the beginnings of Willy Wonka, and how he and his chocolate became famous. First of all, I was a little skeptical about this. I thought that the new actor for Willy would be dumb and badly played, but I got the exact opposite of it. Wonka performed by Timothée Chalamet played absolutely amazing, he did have this magic that somehow Johnny Depp didn't have. He was the actor that fitted the character surprisingly best, from what I have seen so far. Timothée did sing very good, too, and he sang the songs greatly with a nice voice, as well as the rest of the cast. The story was gripping and extremely well developed. Wonka's flashbacks with his mother (Not father this time) was a well addition to the story and his character development came brighter in, and he was more understandable then, too. Wonka as a character was good introduced, but I think his backstory came much later, and could come more on the beginning, but that's ok. Wonka's friend, Noodle, was a good addition to the story, and she as his friend was something amazing. Wonka's connection with Noodle was organic and didn't felt fake at all. The action and build-up was in a way that I could see it was a Paul King film. He directed the two Paddington movies, and he has a similar style of humor and way of building up action. The moral was good, good value and something everyone can get out from the story. But the scenography was the absolutely best thing about the film. The strong, powerful colors from the candy and chocolate, and the amazing decorations and exteriors in the town they lived in. Nice visuals, as well as the costumes for the actors and actress. Hugh Grant as the Umpa-Lumpa had a fantastic costume, and he was characterized great with good make-up and had the perfect size for the creature. The songs were composed fine, sometimes could the text have a better rhythm to the melody, but that was rare, maybe two or three times it happened. In the end, Wonka was a great experience, a perfect film for the whole family, I really liked the first film, but this one is just more magical and made in a different way, that I really enjoyed. Recommending!",
    "105": "Wonka tells the origin story of Willy Wonka(Timothee Chalamet), the iconic chocolatier from Roald Dahl's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Despite being broke, a young Willy Wonka aspires to open the best chocolate shop in the world. However, he finds out that the chocolate industry is run by a cabal of chocolatiers, who are drunk with power.Wonka is an excellent film. Director Paul King has given us a movie that is hilarious, endearing, has a few catchy songs & above all, is super entertaining. The set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are perfect. Watching all of Willy Wonka's magical & delicious chocolates come to life on the big screen, is an absolute joy to watch. Timothee Chalamet is spectacular as Willy Wonka. Chalamet gives us another unforgettable performance, this time in a light-hearted role, that shows his incredible versatility. Calah Lane is outstanding as Noodle. Olivia Colman & Tom Davis are awe-inspiring as Mrs. Scrubbit & Bleacher, respectively. Keegan Michael-Key is hysterical as the Chief of Police. Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas & Mathew Baynton are perfect as Slugworth, Prodnose & Fickelgruber, respectively. Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Jim Carter, Rakhee Thakrar, Natasha Rothwell, Rich Fulcher, Colin O'Brien & Sally Hawkins are perfect as the Oompa-Loompa, Father Julius, Abacus Crunch, Lottie Bell, Piper Benz, Larry Chucklesworth, Young Willy Wonka & Willy's Mother, respectively. Wonka is a must watch for chocolate lovers & fans of Roald Dahl's source material & its two previous big screen adaptations. Watch it & have a whale of a time, with a guaranteed craving for chocolate, once the credits roll!",

    "108": "There's a lot of things to say about this film, I guess we could call a prequel to the original Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory from 1971. Sometimes filmmakers make amazing prequels -Cruella (2021), comes to mind- other times not so much.The story takes us to the very beginning of the Chocolate Factory and the adventures and misadventures a young Willy Wonka had to face on his way of making his dream into reality.There's all sorts of new things happening in this movie. For instance we learn about how Willy Wonka and his first Oompa Loompa met and what had to happen for them to start working together -which added some color to the story, both figuratively and literally speaking-. Another thing, which some die-hard fans of the original film were not happy about, is that they turned Wonka into this joyful and agreeable creature - a gentle magician that pulls things out of his top hat ala Mary Poppins, if you will- someone that doesn't have a mad and scary side, totally unlike the previous interpretations of this peculiar character. So if you're one of those people that loved those unrestrained and darker scenes that we have seen in the previous films (yes I'm referring to the famous boat/tunnel of terror scene) well let's just say this might not be your cup of hot chocolate.Also let's not forget this movie is a musical, therefore expect to hear songs. Now whether the songs are as good as the original 1971 film, or whether they are any good for that matter, that too is open for debate.So all in all, I can understand why fans of the 1971 classic would be annoyed about some aspects of this movie, but let's be honest, the bar was high to begin with, however the question remains, is it not a good film? I kinda wish the first half of it was not as slow, the second half sort of makes up for it with some exciting thrills and action.In the end, I guess only time will tell whether this movie will stand the test of time or fade into obscurity like so many recent remakes, prequels and sequels * cough Mary Poppins Returns cough *.",
    "109": "Just got back from this on its opening release date with my Mom! I absolutely ADORED it!!!The story: Willy Wonka, a magician/inventor/chocolatier arrives in an old English city with a happy hopeful dream: selling chocolate and spreading magic and happiness to all of the townsfolk! However, three other pride and greed infested chocolatiers, Ficklegruber, Prodnose, and Slugworth (collectively knows as The Chocolate Cartel) are instantly consumed with jealousy and annoyance at Wonka's work, and decide to try and crush his dreams. Luckily, with a group of wishy-washy washers from a hard labored laundry business, Wonka might have just the friends he needs to succeed, and make his Mama proud!The cast was an excellent, interesting choice of actors; each actor had the perfect mood to fit their character in different situations in the film. I enjoyed Timothee Chalamet, Hugh Grant, and Olivia Colman's performances the best; they really made me laugh!The film had a nice lighthearted, cheery, and humorous tone to it. A little something for adults, and children. I felt constant giddiness throughout the film! Sets and effects were pretty neat as well. The musical numbers, were outstanding! For each situation in the film, there was an excellent song to go with it! My favorite songs were \"You've never had a Chocolate like This\", and \"A World of your Own\". Plus, as respect payment for the 1971 version, the Oompa-Loompa song, and \"Pure Imagination\" were also featured, with brand new clever lyrics!Overall, this was one of the most happy, funny, exciting, descriptive, detailed, and clever musicals I've ever seen!! I've never felt such giddiness, joy, cheerfulness, and happiness at the movie theater before!! I actually felt like I was a kid again, skipping down the theater steps with my Mom, still singing \"A World of your Own\". I truly cherished Wonka! DON'T miss it!! And if you get the chance, take the kids along too! You'll all have a scrumdidilyumptiously delicious time!!",
    "110": "Just Got out of a Dolby Cinema Screening of WonkaAnother Perfect Watch (For Me)Here's my thoughts on the Film -1. 🎩 Timothy Chalamet as Willy Wonka. I really liked this take, it was a more Delightful Way of Portraying Willy Wonka.2. 📈 The Plotline was Great, I loved it. It was Told in a Very Entertaining Way.3. 📜💬 The Screenplay had a Consistent Interest to it, the at times Snappy Dialogue, the input of Wit here and there and the Cut to Musical Numbers made for a Very Pleasant Watch.4. 🌞 🌚 The Tone. The Fantastical Mood of it all really Elevated the Film Substantially, it was just Constantly Great to Watch. It also has Grounded Emotional Moments Sprinkled in the Film.5. 🙎👩‍⚕️ The Characters. All of the Characters were Fun to watch because they were immersed into this Fantastical Tone. I loved that Vault Scene with Police Chief.6. 🎥 🎬 Cinematography & Editing. The Cinematography was Stunning at times. Absolutely Top Notch Shots and Visuals. The Edits were Spot on 👌7.💃🎠🎪 The Production Design and Costuming. The Set Designs and Costuming were Beautiful. It was a Really Beautifully Crafted World. It was a Fantastic Production 👏8. 🎶 The Songs were Solid. Some were better than Others. My Favourite was the Guy Proposing to a Woman segment. Loved that Segment.Overall, it was a Perfect Watch and it was also an Entertaining Watch.",
    "111": "The book was a part of my childhood and I absolutely adored the film, watching whenever it was on TV... so it was very excited when I heard this was being made.I personally think Timothée Chalamet is a brilliant actor so my expectations were high and then my friend mentioned it was a musical and honestly my heart sank. The original works because it's old and of that time and as a child you feel differently about musicals. Now, I just find them a bit annoying and most have songs for songs sake. So as the first song started, I was more than ready to roll my eyes .... but it didn't happen. The songs were sweet, in-keeping with the story and they didn't feel over the top.Timothée absolutely shone as a yong Willy Wonka with his hat full of magic and hhis heart full of hopes and dreams. I felt his characterisation was perfect, confident but his belief in his craft spoke for itself... in the reaction from those tasting them. I honestly wanted to eat those Hoverchocs myself - A cherry and salted caramel marshmallow chocolate containing a microscopic hover-fly, the descriptions reminded me of the Roald Dahl book.I thought all the supporting actors were brilliant but I particularly loved Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa, a character I immediately connected to and it felt nostalgic to understand how Wonka first became acquainted with them.It's got everything you'd want from a feel good movie from a little injustice, the wonderfully awful villains, the hero and the help. I think this is going to be a huge success and a film I know I'll watch again and again.",
    "112": "Wonka joins a long line of IP that is being squeezed by the film industry as they try to eek out every last penny from recognisable names and brands. But does that mean that this film is just a lazy cash grab? Thankfully no.There is a magically charming quality to this film that warms the heart and puts a smile on the face. It is full of whimsy humour, over exaggerated characters and delightfully lyrical dialogue that all create a fun and engaging world to dive into. You can tell that care has been put into this film.It has a nice and breezy plot with some good character moments and decent momentum, even if it is a little overly sweet at times. I do also think it plays much more to its younger audience than its older one, and could have pushed some of the jokes and dialogue a little more to redress this balance. Overall the story is not particularly showstopping but it does the job.The cast is a veritable who's who of British comedy actors with some great bigger name cameos in there too. I do think the performances are a mixed bag but there are some great ones in here. Then there's the performance from Timothee Chalamet as Wonka, which I wasn't always convinced by. At times I loved it, but at others it feels a little cheesy (and not in the intentionally cheesy way that some of the other performances are).As a musical I was never truly convinced by any of the songs or any of the vocals. I'm writing this review shortly after watching the film and there are no melodies bouncing around my head that I can't shake. Usually after watching a musical I find at least one song to add to my playlist, but that isn't the case here.Ultimately I did like this film and it is a good time, but I think the brilliant tone and vibe cover up some of it's mediocrity. It has a good plot and a good lead performance, but there isn't much about this film that is amazing.",
    "113": "1hour and 56 minutes of pure brilliance.We smiled, we laughed, we cried. It will take you to a world of pure imagination and keep you there the entire time.It will end up being a classic and one not to miss. I couldn't name one thing I didn't like so this was a 10 for me.Think 'The Greatest Showman' meets 'Willy Wonka'.It's been a long time since I've left the movie theatre feeling the way Wonka made me feel.Being 35 means I had a childhood watching classics, one of them being Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I must prepare you. The end of this new 'Wonka' will take you right back to those same feelings you got watching the original for the first time. Prepare yourself to well up.Those first musical notes of 'Pure imagination' is transformative.Wonderful. Just wonderful.",
    "114": "This film is way too long.The concept has been done a million times before but better than this. The casting is adequate but none of them can really sing. The girl Noddy or whatever she's called was like a cardboard cutout, she really lacked something to make her part believable or to connect to the audience. Olivia Coleman played Olivia Coleman, she's really good at playing Olivia Coleman.The lead was ok, but that's all I can say. The storytelling was adequate and cinematography too but it's just \"meh\" from start to finish. It was all I could do to stay awake on a miserable UK day.Hugh Grant was washed out with CGI, in this day and age you'd think they'd be able to make things at least appear real.I wasted 40 quid on this rubbish.",
    "115": "WONKA is a huge surprise and a fun time at the movies. I didn't really expect much going in, besides King's attachment as director, but was surprised at how well-made this film is. It blends movie magic, well choreographed musical numbers, and a heartwarming story to make the perfect family film. Although I would've preferred a bit more moral and meaning to the story, Wonka delivers a feel-good experience and I enjoyed it a lot. It is just what it needs to be and subverts expectations. When I first heard about Chalamet's casting as the title character, I thought it wouldn't work, coming off of Dune (2021), but I was wrong. His charisma and joyous presence on screen made me realize his capability as an actor. All of the cast members were really good, but the main star of the film is director Paul King. He previously directed Paddington 1 and 2, two films my family and I really enjoyed, and was my only source of optimism for this film. He really knocked it out of the park with the way he handled the story and reassured my faith in him as a filmmaker. The way he handled the musical elements of the film were especially well done. Overall, this is one of the better films I've seen this year and deserves more attention.",
    "116": "I hardly ever used this word to describe movies but Wonka is absolutely delightful in almost every way. Honestly if someone watched it and told me they weren't at least charmed by it I might question their sanity. Sometimes it's just nice to have a film about good people doing good things with a really wholesome message and outlook on life and Wonka delivers all of that and then some.Timothée Chalamet is amazing in this movie, very few actors could emulate that overly whimsy style of humour that Gene Wilder perfected and he does it so perfectly. The way he plays this character is so unbelievably endearing with just the right amount of sentimentality and it never made me cringe once, quite the opposite in fact. He's just the head of a whole cast full of unbelievably likeable characters that ensure that this entire film is chock full of satisfying moments some of which even brought a tear to my eye as cheesy as it might sound.It really should come as no surprise how well produced this film is on a technical and script level considering the fact that it's the same man who brought about both the Paddington films. It's gorgeously shot, especially from a cinematography perspective, and I loved all of the musical sequences all of which I'm still playing in my head right now. It's laugh out loud funny with a lot more well rounded character moments than I ever would've expected. This clearly was not a pay check job for anyone involved and this is the kind of craft I would love to see more of in blockbuster movies.If I had to knock the film for a few things it would be that a lot of the stuff away from the Wonka character wasn't nearly as entertaining.

Depp's was too tied up in the simile with Michael Jackson that it was just creepy and unpleasant, and I say that as a huge fan.We go back decades in the Wonka world to this film and we find a young man who is softer and kinder. This all makes sense.The casting is insanely brilliant, the pacing spot on, the script bonkers and wonderful with so many deft touches. The sets beautiful, the CGI well-managed and the music is simply amazing. We're still humming them all today and will be for years to come. Bravo Hannon and Talbot.Do a few of the actors need their singing a little digitally-corrected? Yes. But in a world of Wonka gloss and magic, I think that's a tiny criticism given what a wonderful, magical world it creates and how it fleshes out the Wonka story in such a respectful fashion that I think Dahl would be delighted with.And, wow, Calah Lane... watch her go places.",
    "123": "A prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an enticing idea, especially if the film is a prequel to either the 1971 or 2005 film. It should not be a difficult endeavour provided there is consistency to one film or the other. The problem I found with this film is that the setting has the Germanic vibe of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory but Timothee Chalamet is challenging Johnny Depp from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Apart from the Johnny Depp's Wonka impersonation, there is nothing in this film that is related to that 2005 film. The backstory of the dentist father and the origins of the oompa loompa are dropped for something different. Shame. I would have liked it if this film was set in that universe. To add to the disappointment we did not get a story that is set in the 1971 universe either as the character of Slugworth and the people are completely different as well. Put it this way it is a film very much for 2023.There are some positives. I found Timothee Chalamet charming and a great fit for the role. Some of the jokes landed, but not enough to warrant a comedy (in the full house I saw it in, no one laughed out once). Paterson Joseph was fantastic as the villainous Slugworth. It was also great to see Tom Davis get more screen time (a very underrated actor). Hugh Grant was probably the best bit of the film and it is a shame we did not get more of him. The dancing was also fun to watch.Unfortunately, for me, most of the songs did not land. The story was also lame and the character of this young Wonka did not gel with the craggy, somewhat mean, reclusive character we know when his chocolate ideas get stolen. To be honest I was somewhat bored by it. I checked the time twice as I felt it was 20 minutes too long.It is not a film I would see twice after loving the first two movies. I came away disappointed as it was the prequel I had hoped to see.",
    "124": "The movie was funny and enjoyable.Timothee Chalamet and Hugh Grant performances were great, their characters charming and memorable. But that's it.It's a pitty as the movie had all the ingredients to be an above average movie. But the story is dull, the other characters aside wonka and the Oompa loompa are really plain. And neither of the songs or the scenes are near to memorable. (Excluding the songs from the original movie)Compared to the two previous adaptations where I can still sing some of the songs from the top of my mind and remember the scenes and most of the characters, I can't remember any of the original songs of this movie just after whatching it, and I'm sure I will be forgetting the rest...I'm aware this is due to having high expectations, so without any context, the movie is a good one.7/10.",
    "125": "Wonka - 8.5/10An unashamed family musical that is perfect for this time of year. It took 2 or 3 musical numbers before it grabbed me, but when it did, I found myself comparing it to Aladdin in terms of how catchy the songs were and how much energy it had. Then I realised that I am comparing a classic Disney animation with live action, which is the biggest compliment I can pay this film. Paul King has effortlessly achieved something that is incredibly tough to pull off. It puts every single Disney live action 'remake' to shame.The plot is a little messy, but they deserve credit for not just retreading the same Wonka story we've already seen twice on the big screen. I felt that King and Farnaby were looking at multiple Roald Dahl stories for inspiration. The three members of the chocolate cartel reminded me of the three farmers from Fantastic Mr Fox. The Giraffe bit reminded me of the The Giraffe, The Pelly and Me. Olivia Coleman and Tom Davies grumpy landlords were reminiscent of The Twits etc...Paddington 2 is a tough act to follow, and whilst this is a little uneven and has slight pacing issues, I think you just must let those knit picks fall to the floor and go with it. It's a joyous and hilarious film. Neil Hannon's music is catchy and full of clever word play. Other than a few moments where Wonka's eccentricity is a bit of a stretch, Timothée Chalamet does more than enough to cement his place as the second-best screen Wonka. There's plenty of room for the Wilder cynicism to grow within him, but for now we have a much more wide-eyed and optimistic Wonka and I look forward to seeing where they take him in the inevitable sequels that follow.Can Paul King make Wonka 2 as good as Paddington 2? He's certainly laid the chocolatey foundations.",
    "126": "A feel-good rewatchable movie to end 2023!Willy Wonka is a beloved character by people regardless of age. Most of us grew up watching either of the first two live adaptation of Willy Wonka. I believe that's why many people had high expectations about this one. And why some had doubts if the cast could embody the magic we felt when we were first introduced to the magical and silly world of Willy Wonka. But I was not disappointed! It was even better that I imagined. Although it may not be as magical and exciting as our beloved childhood movies, I believe Wonka (2023) gave justice to the character and film. Children and early teens watching the show surely will look back at this film 10-20 years from now and they will feel nostalgic watching this.That was the big emotion the move left me. It made me feel nostalgic of my early youth. It was like revisiting an old friend you haven't talked with in years. It visited a lot of my favorite themes such as found family, youth, dreams, and hope! I admit the movie also tackles a bit of deep and disturbing topics that mirrors our society like corruption, selfishness/greed, deception, and one's growing pains. Although portrayed in a lighthearted and surface-level manner, it has captured the topics enough for children not to think too much of it while young adults to adults can obviously decipher what was really happening.I'm leaving this review hours after I watched the film and have plans on re-watching it because it made me feel good! Many might wonder and dislike the naivety of the young Willy Wonka and how problems were so easily solved. But to be honest, we (or rather I) could use a little simplicity to cope from this overcomplicated world.I left watching the film teary-eyed because it made me realize once again that we could never go back to the way it was in our childhood. And maybe that's why older or more mature audience were a tad bit more critical about the film. Because we can predict the punchlines, look past the fantasy, and expect more from the film to somewhat pull us from our reality and bring back that childlike fun. But it can't. Instead, it can only make us remember.I for one believe that the movie deserves high rating because it was never truly about the chocolate that made people fly or turn into all sorts of silly things that made us love the willy wonka universe, it was the characters, the experience, and childhood innocence we once had. It was our past introduction of the character. Although we may never completely get back our childhood lens, we can experience new places and meet people who will be there with us to create happy memories.I'm glad I gave it a chance because I got to be somewhat a fan of Timothée Chalamet's acting after watching the film. The only other films I have fully watched where he was a cast are little women and don't look up.I'm not really sure if giving it a perfect rating would be appropriate but I'm also not sure how they could have made the movie better since everything was fantastic so I gave it a 9/10.Wonka (2023) at its core is a lighthearted, silly, and magical movie that will give you nostalgia.",
    "127": "First of all this movie is just amazing, I thought from the trailers that this movie would be slightly unbearable with some of the shots from Timothee chalamet but having just watched it, I am pleasantly surprised with the performance.Having seen Paul King's other work you can really tell he directed this movie as it's riddled with his charm. The comedy is actually quite funny and I really enjoyed Calah Lane in this movie I thought she did an excellent job as \"Noodle\" and she had the 2nd best performance in the whole movie except Timothee.The story of this movie is everything you expect from the trailers and really could be an original Roald Dahl story as it is well paced, funny, smart and of course magical.I will 100% watch this movie again and I actually want to watch it again already having only just left the cinema.The editing, set design, costumes and cinematography are just perfect.",
    "128": "For this occasion, I leave you the opinion of the movie \"Wonka\", the beginnings of the most famous chocolatier by British author Roald Dahl. He has two previous films, which is \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" and, the one that many of us know, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\"\nWonka, more than a movie, a musical.Once you go to see the film, you will realize that the musical choreographies are going to be the daily bread. Something that fits perfectly with the optimistic protagonist who will have a blow with the reality of what it means to be in the city.And not everything is lost, because the illusion does not escape anywhere... even on a cold night like the one that occurs in the city. And well, song after song, we will see the scenes pass in front of our television.In themselves, they are catchy and do not have a tone that stands out or seems forced within the film. So, I think it is well integrated.A Willy less Wonka.Those who saw \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", and who also liked Johnny Depp's performance, may see the character's charisma diminished. That can leave a bittersweet taste for those who expect that \"charisma\", however we must keep in mind that the character is at the beginning and must face a world in which he does not have control.Here, in this film, a legend is born, but it still has a lot to grow. Of course he is very good at what he does.Final conclusion.The movie reminded me a little of a musical. Perhaps it would adapt well to Broadway easily, but plot-wise there is nothing new about it. It is a film that has a special magic, it is dynamic and fun to watch with charismatic characters and a fairly dark background.So my recommendation is not that it is a movie that you must see no matter what, but for a fun afternoon of disconnecting and listening to some \"Disney\" style songs. However, I wouldn't invest the time if I have other things to do.",
    "129": "This is one of the biggest surprises of the year, a movie that treads a thin line of nostalgia and creativity. For the most part it succeeds gracefully.Gene Wilder, I and everyone agree is the gold standard for Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp is a love it or hate it version. If you like your Wonka's fascinatingly creepy. Timothy Chalamet is a different version, wholesome with a bit of looney. Endlessly optimistic with a touch of naive. He does a great job no doubt, not the best singer, but damnit he gives it his all. The supporting cast is also very good, the villains memorable, however the little girl Noodles, is a mixed performance, sometimes ok, other times off key.The whole package is uneven, it's not a perfect movie. The story suffers, especially at the end. But it doesn't derail the whole picture. There is very good musical performances and great imagination that is worth the price alone.Give it a chance and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",
    "130": "So, I caught the new \"Wonka\" flick recently, and I gotta say, it really hit the sweet spot for me. Timothée Chalamet as Wonka brought this whole new charm to the character - it's like he was born for the role.And can we talk about Calah Lane as Noodle? She added this extra layer of heart to the story, making it all the more enjoyable. Plus, diving into Wonka's past and his relationship with his mom? That got me right in the feels.The movie balanced nostalgia with a fresh twist. It's like revisiting an old friend while discovering something new. The storyline felt just right - not too predictable, not too out there.If you're into a delightful mix of charm, heart, and a dash of nostalgia, \"Wonka\" is the ticket. Timothée Chalamet's performance and the whole storyline make it a must-watch, whether you're a die-hard fan or just dipping your toes into Wonka's world.",
    "131": "I can't remember any of the songs from this movie, but I thought that the film was very well done.Timothee Chalamet, has demonstrated in this movie that his musical talents should be put to use in the world of cinema and he was born to be in a theatrical production of some sort in his lifetime! I really hope he is in more musical movies or even gets an opportunity in broadway!I'm going to see it again because I do remember the music matching well with what I was seeing on screen, but I don't see myself ever listening to the album without the visuals because I don't think the songs were that catchy? But I do think the music was good, but maybe music doesn't need to he catchy in order for it to be good..?! (I know I don't make sense saying that) But I think I need a few more listens for me to find the songs memorable/good.I think Timothee also demonstrated Wonka's quirky side well and he was also able to show that Wonka was a genius, an amazing business person and a genius with an open-mind, don't give up on your dreams even if the competition tries to stop you, rise above it and show the world what you have to accomplish and let your dreams come to light! That is the message I took from this movie.",
    "132": "Timothée Chalamet delivers a great and joyful performance, the supporting cast shines as well and Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa was hilarous and made the whole cinema giggle and laugh.The music is good, the mix between action, fun and heartwarming moments is well balanced, providing for an overall joyful cinema experience. Several scenes were laugh-out-loud funny, others quite emotional (but nothing too severe). You could feel the creativity and love put into the movie.There were quite a lot of musical scenes, which I was not aware of going into the film, some worked better than others, but they contributed to the overall feeling of the movie.I hoped to get a bit more of Wonka's backstory, in terms of how he maybe wandered through the world having adventures while collecting all the ingredients for his chocolate, coming up with the very specific ideas, etc. But the story told was nonetheless interesting.Is it the best movie I have ever seen? Well, no. But it's great for what it is and will defintely bring you 2 hours of great entertainment, nice visuals, good performances and is just great to bring you into the *magical* Christmas feeling.",
    "133": "\"Wonka\" is more than just a movie; it's an experience.

    "134": "I watched 'Wonka,' the new film from the Fantastic Chocolate Factory that tells the story of Willy Wonka, and I consider it a true masterpiece. It's a magical, beautiful, and wonderful film.The cast, characters, and visuals are incredibly creative, providing an experience that harks back to the magic of classic films. The story is well-constructed, filled with funny scenes that guarantee enjoyment and laughter, along with emotionally moving moments.The songs are truly beautiful, contributing to the fantastic atmosphere of the film. 'Wonka' is a brilliant homage to the Fantastic Chocolate Factory.I was deeply moved, as 'The Fantastic Chocolate Factory' marked my childhood profoundly. Almost cried when the movie started. Congratulations on the film! 👏Rating: 9.7/10.",
    "135": "This, at its roots, is a fun movie. Beautiful sets and costumes with wild characters and cheerful songs. The music is not the most unique but it is catchy, bright, heartfelt, and there are a few standouts and callbacks to the original which ties things together nicely.We have met these types of characters before in many ways in many movies, but you enjoy their performances and root for the good guys with their charm and enthusiasm. The bad guys are a classic trio, nothing remarkable there again though all good performances.Everyone is a great singer, nothing super mind blowing but enjoyable with some lovely harmonies here and there.Overall it's a nice homage to the original and I love the imagination and creativity. It feels more like a musical than a movie but I enjoyed every minute and thought it was just a light hearted and fun experience! I would watch again :)"
