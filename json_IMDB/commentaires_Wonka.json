    "0": "I went into this piece of cinema blind, taking a half day off work to take my young daughter to see it at the theater.Boy, was I happy to do so. The story is original, the actors superb, the music phenomenal, and the production was stupendous. It's a visual and auditory feast for the senses. I even shed a little tear at the end.Fans of the original will love it, and as mentioned, my little girl who's normally quite antsy watching anything outside of an animated feature was glued to her seat. I can't wait to watch it again with the family. This is a big win for the fantasy / musical genre of film.",
    "1": "WOW just wow this exceeded my expectations by a long way , I don't really rate the Tim Burton remake with his stablemate Jonny Depp it misses the charm of the cult classic 1971 sleeper hit with Gene Wilder but this was a brand new story , a brand new musical with instantly loveable songs & thankfully the song we weee all waiting for being added to full effect at just the right moment. The common theme here is good vs evil & corporate greed suppressing the competition using corruption with good trumping over evil as only Hollywood can do , the sets were amazing using Harry Potters leaveden studios merged with scene of Somerset's gem Bath city . Story , acting and cinematography all absolutely brilliant and the back story was as emotional as Oliver , this has all the makings of a cult classic and great stage musical very much similar to the greatest show - go see itPad. A 10/10.",
    "2": "Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the city, but is plagued by bad luck, tricked into becoming a slave for nefarious hotel proprietors Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Coleman) and Bleacher (Tom Davis), and then targeted by the chocolate cartel, who see to it that Wonka's enterprise is a failure. Fortunately, help comes in the form of orphan Noodle (Calah Lane) and Wonka's co-workers in the hotel laundry.This latest film inspired by Roald Dahl's classic is a sickly confection, the main ingredients being forgettable songs, a predictable plot, and insipid humour, with another drippy performance from Chalamet as the titular chocolatier.Wonka has none of Dahl's deliciously dark content -- by the end of this overly saccharine tale, which ladles on the schmaltz, I actually felt a little queasy; the 2005 Tim Burton/Johnny Depp movie wasn't great, but at least I didn't want to hurl by the end of it. Putting it in chocolate terms, Wonka is the cinematic equivalent of an American chocolate bar, with its pukey aftertaste, not 'a glass and a half' of delicious British chocolate (anyone who has ever compared the two will know what I mean).On a slightly more positive note, Hugh Grant puts in the only commendable performance as an Oompa-Loompa, and some of the visuals are impressive (although the film relies far too heavily on CGI).3/10.",
    "3": "Origin stories can be hit (\"Wicked\" the musical) or miss (who even remembers \"Oz the Great and Powerful\"?). On that scale \"Wonka\" is closer to hit than miss, although it's far from a masterpiece. The film is funny, and has a number of witty ideas (many of which make it in the trailer, like the fine against daydreaming). It also has delicious characters, starting with Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa, the real memorable character of the piece. It all rings true to the spirit of Roald Dahl, although the double missing mommy storyline felt somewhat forced. What prevents this movie from being great, however, is that it often stays in safe, blockbuster-friendly territory, and resists the Call of the Absurd that could have transcended it. The film is often more amusing than really funny and rather more cute than touching, while its dose of whimsy always feels extremely calibrated, like its CGI visuals. Yet it was easy to see how putting Mr Bean and a runaway giraffe together in a church could have led to wilder results than what we are ultimately given. Or how Keegan-Michael Key as the chief of police could have brought more as a supporting character. Maybe it's remembering Tim Burton's brand of humor, which was already in decline when he made \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and yet felt more satirical than this very tame \"Wonka\". Or maybe seeing sweet, cloying Chalamet in a fantasy version of Paris reminded me of \"The French Dispatch\" and Wes Anderson's inimitable take on whimsy. In fact, if you really want a memorable take on Dahl, you should check out Anderson's short movies - I find them more personal and authentic than this very corporate friendly, very safe \"Wonka\".",
    "4": "This was for me not quite the level of the original but better than Depps version. What I found most distracting was the endless need for songs where they weren't really needed, they weren't memorable or catchy they just felt lazy and forced, like every kids movie now seems to be full of music.The acting part was far better, story was sweet, solid and flowed nicely, a lot of fun cameos that most English tv fans will recognise, the design and costumes were great and the special effects were awesome to. Hugh grants little orange man was a highlight as was the talented girl who played noodle.Biggest floor... TC for me hasn't got a great voice for singing.",
    "5": "Listen, I liked this movie. It was good, I just wished it gave me more. Felt like there was some underutilizing of potential, so it felt s little hollow for me.It didn't tug on my heart strings or emotions ever, but it made it chuckle and Timothee was great as Wonka. A lot of unecessary singing. I can fully get into a good musical if the songs are good and properly placed and spread out, but I can't stand it when they sing songs just to sing, when they could just... talk. Some of the songs the movie weren't really catchy or even good, and felt pointless.Positives: great casting, funny, beautiful sets and costumes. Could watch it at home just to watch a cozy movie (if you're into musicals), but not worth seeing in the theaters like I did.",
    "6": "\"Wonka\" is a pleasant prequel to \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\", the script achieves a perfect story for the holiday season and for the whole family, with a simple but effective comedy and good dramatic moments that are strong points for the film production. The production level is excellent, the costume design manages to be fun and the performances are good, especially that of Timothée Chalamet as Willy Wonka, in addition to a successful special performance by Sally Hawkins. The musical numbers are well choreographed and managed to be performed by the voices of the entire cast. One negative thing to highlight are the digital special effects that look fake in every scene in which they are added. The editing work is of a good level. The music composed for the film has potential and is enjoyable. \"Wonka\" shines as a great movie for the Christmas season.",
    "7": "This movie seemed to have it all. All of the actors played parts well and Timothee Chalamet is certainly fun to watch. The bits with the Oompah Loompa, played by Hugh Grant, should have been expanded. The sets, costumes and special effects were amazing. The music was from the original Wonka movie so that was nice. The story was almost completely new which I hoped to be nice too. Not so much. The spark I was looking for in the new story was missing for me, even though the actors and director were clearly giving it their best shot at it. I think the writing was the culprit. I was a bit bored in parts. If the writers were looking to get laughs, I don't recall breaking a smile more than once or twice and I think it was something that Rowan Atkinson was doing as the Priest. I did not hear anyone laugh in the theater the whole time. Most of the jokes I think we were supposed to laugh at were pretty lame. I will not be recommending this movie to any adult or child I know. I don't see it appealing to any age unless they are big fans of someone appearing in the film.",
    "8": "First of all... This new take on a young Wonka is actually fresh and interesting. We were used on Wonka being a secondary character of Charlie and the golden ticket story.The movie is well crafted but it has serious problems:i) Chalamet is a fantastic actor and has the potential to be one of the great ones of his generation BUT he was a miscast. Im sorry, but i just don´t see him as Wonka.Ii) Part of what makes a musical great is that the songs and numbers are meant to be remarkable and catchy. After almost 80 years, people still sing singin´in the rain yet Wonka has no memorable song or tune except for the Oompa Loompa bit that was taken straight outta the original one.To me, this 2 flaws are terrible and make it a bad Wonka movie and a bad musical but taking those out of the equation, it is actually a good film.Enjoy it with your loved ones,Stay safe and happy holidays.",
    "9": "Oh so disappointed with this film. Been looking forward to it being released, I mean who doesn't love Willy Wonka.45 minutes into the film I was looking at my watch. I was so bored. The music was awful, the singing even worse. The story was terribly weak and very dull. I couldn't care less. I couldn't get invested in any of the characters apart from Hugh Grant who was adorable. He was the only character that kept me marginally entertained.The snowy cold scenes made it feel Christmassy, a bit like a Dickensian film which was okay. It just lacked magic. It could have been so much more.I just wanted to leave the cinema. If I had gone to watch this film on my own, I would have left.",
    "10": "I'd been looking forward to seeing this ever since I was aware of it being filmed in my hometown, Bath, years ago.I'm still trying to understand how they messed this up. They had all the ingredients to make a truly scrumptious film -instead it's an inedible mess. The story is weak, the songs are forgettable and it is NOT an origin story.There are so many cameos from class actors and Timotheé Chalamet does the best he can with a really weak story.I've been left wondering who the film was for. It was too sugary sweet for kids and adults. It's nothing like as good as Paddington 2 which worked on many levels. Watch the Gene Wilder one instead.",
    "11": "I had high hopes with Wonka mainly due to the fact Paul King was directing. Paddington 1 &2 are some of the best family films ever made and their charm makes them a great watch every time. Wonka now joins that list.First off, the production design is spectacular. It really is pure imagination. The costumes, set pieces, songs and casting were all fantastic. The pacing was spot on and no time did I feel bored or that it dragged.Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa was brilliant but for me Timothee Chalamet stole the show. His singing and acting was fantastic and really immersed you in the Wonka story.2023 has been a fantastic year for film and Wonka rounds off the year perfectly. A must watch!",
    "12": "Worst movie I've seen in years.Went to see it out of nostalgia and walked out after an hour. Simply awful.The singing and music is terrible, the acting awful. Recreating the Wonka persona doesn't work for me. As a character it was just too far removed from what I remember as a child.Children with no knowledge of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory will probably enjoy this as a stand alone movie but some things should just be left alone.Looking at cast, and the director, this movie should be much better than it is, but falls well short. Doubled up with the most talkative and disrespectful crowd I've experienced in the cinema meant there was no joy from me.",
    "13": "Greetings again from the darkness. It appears as though I'm one of the few early viewers who walked away without having been beguiled or enraptured with this musical prequel to Roald Dahl's 1964 story, \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". Full disclosure requires me to admit that I actually found it a bit dull, and that's mostly due to the lead performance by Timothy Chalamet. I understand that he's the hottest young actor working today, and brings along an entire fan base, but for me, Willy Wonka should have a twinkle in his eye, a spring in his step, and enough charm to draw folks in ... even at a younger age.Writer-director Paul King and co-writer Simon Farnaby collaborated on the thoroughly entertaining PADDINGTON 2 (2017) and are back at it in this third film from Dahl's classic children story. Most recently, there was Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (2005), and it's been more than 50 years since Gene Wilder bounded between charming and menacing in Mel Stuart's WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (1971). King and Farnaby deliver an origin story which allows for a much nicer (or should it be sweeter) Willy Wonka, and instead sprinkles the menace on a few supporting characters, ensuring some dark themes are present.A \"deal\" with Willy's mother (Sally Hawkins) has the illiterate Wonka arriving in town with only a few coins in his pocket, and a dream to build his chocolate factory. His innocence and naivety soon leave him penniless and contracted into indentured servitude, along with some others, at a shady laundry establishment run by the dentally challenged Mrs Scrubbitt (Oscar winner Olivia Colman) and her baritone behemoth assistant Bleacher (Tom Davis). Willy bonds with the others being held captive, including young orphan Noodle (Calah Lane), who somehow holds the same optimistic outlook as her new friend. Willy soon discovers that he has landed in the town with a chocolate cartel led by Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton), the local chocolatiers who bribe the Police Chief (Keegan-Michael Key) with none other than ... chocolate, in order to keep the new kid from selling his superior goodies.Willy has even more challenges to deal with, including a knee-high, orange-faced Oompa-Loompa (Hugh Grant), who seeks restitution by stealing from Willy Wonka while he sleeps. Grant's Oompa-Loompa is a definite highlight here (just as he was in PADDINGTON 2), especially during his song. The other familiar song in the film is \"Pure Imagination\", though none of the new songs by Neil Hannon are particular catchy or memorable.In addition to Grant's sarcastic Oompa-Loompa, another highlight is certainly Nathan Crowley's Production Design, ranging from Scrubbitt's grungy basement to the picturesque town square and ultimately, the chocolate store sequence. The decision to have the young, idealistic Willy overflowing with optimism and lacking the grumpiness and menace of the grown Wonka makes sense for an origin story ... I simply didn't find it as magical, as entertaining, or as interesting.Opens in theaters nationwide on December 15, 2023.",
    "14": "Pretty disappointing, considering the quality of the cast and wonderful stories written by Roald Dahl.This movie is a pretty picture sugarbombwith with absollutely no consideration for the silly wickedness of the original story. Compare it with the movies of the past, where Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp performing a magical, slightly villainous Wonka, and the Disneyfied version Chalamet is playing.Paul King dropped the ball here. If you want to see a run of the mill feel good Christmas movie, by all means take your kids and enjoy the show. If you love the work of Roald Dahl, and the movies made by Tim Burton, or Danny de Vito's Mathilda, you should pass on this one.",
    "15": "This movie is advertised as an origin to Willy Wonka. Instead it should be advertised as a musical that has a merry-go-round plot that never actually progresses. We don't actually know anything else about Wonka that we know from the original.The plot starts off with Wonka getting trapped in smelly laundry/hotel with some other prisoners. Right then and there the writers trap the main character behind an almost impossible way of escape. So for about an hour of this film, Wonka attempts to escape this, and ultimately gets bought out by Slugworth. His candy shop is destroyed, and then he decides he wants to help Noodle by going after his \"Chocolate Mafia\". The last minute of the movie rushes around with Wonka and the Oompa Loompa creating a factory and that's it.Hugh Grant delivers an awesome Oompa Loompa performance, however his lack of screen time and interaction with Wonka was very disappointing.If you're going to this movie expecting to see how Wonka creates his inventions, chocolates, factory, and discovery of Oompa Land, well you'll be leaving like a bad batch of Wonka chocolate.",
    "16": "I went to go watch this movie out of personal interest since I was a huge fan of the 2005 Willy Wonka version.For this movie specifically, it was a good attempt. People did get to learn more depthful insights on what drives Willy Wonka to become who he is. His color inspirations and drive backed by a lack of common sense defines his name.The creative uses of candy and colorful creations are enough to inspire anyone. The story and development was all right, a little simple but gets the job done.My only issue was how there was a bit too much singing. The songs are all right but some songs weren't needed. There could of been more time spent on critical development for Wonka.",
    "17": "There's a lot to like in Wonka, the lead Timothy Chalamet is perfect and a fabulous lead and a great voice for the original songs written for the film.But for the running time I wanted a better story than we was given, mediocre characters and unmemorable performances other than the lead does not a great film make,everyone does their best but the writing is very weak and sadly the modern use of cartel and violence in the film felt out of place & unnecessary.As a prequel to Willy Wonka this falls short,though it has it's charm with luscious sets and colours but sadly I found it disappointing.",
    "18": "I adore the original 1971 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it is a true classic. The 2005 edition with Johnny Depp was okay but compared to this film it is a masterpiece of epic proportion.Chalamet does not do a great job as the titular character, it feels like he was overacting constantly. The story is strange and is hard to follow. The visuals may look attractive to some but personally I found them nauseating. The songs are terrible and forgettable, and there is an unnecessary amount of them. Very very few jokes land.Hugh Grant does an ok job but others did not perform here.Don't waste your money seeing this.",
    "19": "Wonka (2023) :\nMovie Review -Wonka Review: So you must have read Roal Dahl's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (1964); you must have seen Gene Wilder's blockbuster \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" (1971) and then Tom Burton-Johnny Depp's mega hit \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005), so now it's time for Timothée Chalamet's origin story of Willy Wonka with \"Wonka\" (2023). It's been almost seven decades, and the tale hasn't lost a bit of its magic. It's so enchanting, joyful, and colourful that all you need to do is handle it with your good skills. That's it. You have success in your hands because the source material is just too good. Comedy lover Paul King gets it right. Paul understood the assignment well. Wonka is an exhilarant, amusing, extremely engaging, musically vibrant, and full of chocolate entertainer that stays true to its origin and gives it a nice modern touch as well.Wonka is like a prequel to what you have seen in Wilder and Depp's movies. There you have a chocolate factory, and here the story takes you to the backstory before the factory was built. Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) is a youngster with the talent to make incredible chocolates. He isn't settled yet, though. Rather, he hasn't started his career. He keeps wandering the streets and halls and showcasing his talent for making chocolate that can instantly win people's tongues and stomachs. Since he is selling chocolates at cheap rates that even \"poor\" people can afford, the competitors sense the danger. They try their best to keep him out of the business in whatever way possible, and most of the time they succeed. Amidst his ambition of becoming a great chocolate maker, Wonka is scammed by a small hotel owner and is made her servant for years to come. With the help of Noodle/Nicole (Calah Lane) and other imprisoners, Wonka must find a way out and also set his business against the corrupt chocolate businessmen.First of all, Paul King has written a king-size entertainer for all age groups. The humour is organic, the gags are real, and the magical touch of Wonka's fantasy world makes this one very interesting and engaging. The musical numbers are also well written, as the lyrics have meaning to keep the mood going. Wonka's origin story is not old or outdated; rather, it's completely unknown for many, and that's why there are so many pleasant surprises in the movie. In the end, we see Wonka building the factory, which we all know, and you can connect dots very well there. We are short on good musical comedies nowadays, and thanks to Paul King for writing one that lives up to expectations. We had children, young males and females, and adults in our special show, and the comical segment had us all in splits at the time. I think that's just dandy. I was craving; I was drooling for chocolates by the end, and I wish I could enter the screen just like Mia Farrow did it in Woody Allen's \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" (1985) and devour the mashmello and all the flavours. It's so freaking tasty.Timothée Chalamet is fantastic as Wonka. I wouldn't dare compare this young lad with legends like Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder, but yes, he is our Willy Wonka, alright. If those generations remember Wilder and Depp at that time, then let this social media generation remember Chalamet. Calah Lane is a sweet child with some adorable scenes, and she looks so cute in all of them. Paterson Joseph is not the deadly, cruel, but funnily cruel villain here that one would expect in a chocolate-comedy flick like this. There is something about his character that we miss in so many other musical comedies. Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton (that yuk \"poor\" joke was so rich) support him well. Keegan-Michael Key's transformation had the audience on a roll by the end. Our favourite Mr. Bean, Rowan Atkinson, is a desperate chocoholic, but who must have thought about giving his character the reference of a priest? I mean, it's so hilarious to know. The first frame of his had the audience hooting, and we all really wanted him to have more screen space. Jim Carter, Tom Davis, Olivia Colman, Hugh Grant, Sally Hawkins, Natasha Rothwell, Rakhee Thakrar, Rich Fulcher, and others were fine in their supporting roles.Joby Talbot's songs have made Wonka extra delicious, and one can even go on tapping their feet in the cinema hall without even realising when that process begins, automatically. I was tapping my feet, and I didn't even realise it. Mark Everson's editing has literally no flaws. The only scene that looked slow and dated was when Noodle finds her mother, and then you have to think again to know how important that scene was for the film. Chung-hoon Chung's camera gives you some yummy frames of chocolate and whatnot. Roald Dahl's classic character needed a modern restoration on celluloid, and Paul King has given us that. Action, music, comedy, a little bit of a thrill, and an overflow of chocolates-that's what Paul serves you on the table in no time. Scrumptious is the word! \"You've never tasted chocolate like this,\" says Wonka in one of the songs, and I can assure you that he really meant it. This chocoholic musical melody deserves to be swallowed with tasty rashes on your tongue. There is no need to go to any chocolate shop; just visit the nearest cinema hall.RATING - 6/10*",
    "20": "Wonka is an amazing movie! This film, directed by Paul King, is a feel-good musical that took me on a very emotional ride. Viewers learn the origin story of the eccentric chocolatier and magician.Willy (Timothée Chalamet) dreams of opening a chocolate shop in the Gallery Gourmet but quickly runs out of money. He meets Bleacher (Tom Davis), who introduces Willy to Mrs. Scrubbitt (Olivia Colman), who tricks him into a contract and forces him to work in her laundry room to pay off his debt. There he meets other indentured workers - Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), Lottie Bell (Rakhee Thakrar) and Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher). Noodle (Calah Lane) becomes Willy's closest ally and joins him to defeat the corrupt Chocolate Cartel and reach his goal of opening a chocolate shop.I never expected to feel so many emotions in a Willy Wonka movie. There is the familiar magicalness of Willy who whips up the most amazing chocolate and candy confections, like Hoverchocs that can make you fly. Yet the performances, musical score and art direction really pulled me into the story. The song, \"Pure Imagination,\" appears in different versions throughout the film and adds to the emotional experience. I really like the character development and the sibling-like friendship between Willy and Noodle. When Willy agrees to secretly leave town to free his friends, Timothée Chalamet's singing of \"Sorry Noodle\" had me crying my eyes out. The evilness of the Chocolate Cartel led by Mr. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph) had me so angry as they repeatedly try to defeat Willy and they eventually trap Willy and Noodle. My favorite part is when the Oompa Loompa Lofty (Hugh Grant) saves Willy and Noodle from being drowned in chocolate.The message of Wonka is to let your imagination run wild and keep striving for your dreams even when the odds are stacked against you. In the end, the struggle will be worth it, especially if you have friends to share your success with.I give Wonka 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. The film will be released in theaters on December 15, 2023. By Kira O., KIDS FIRST!",
    "21": "This is how you stretch ten minutes of predictable and bad plot out over two hours.Even worse it's a musical with terrible, cringeworthy songs. Felt like getting up and walking out every time they started singing, found myself just sitting and knowing the pain of another horrendous song was coming.Nothing was funny in this film, it was just painful. Blatantly obvious that Roald Dahl had nothing to do with writing this. It just seemed like another pointless reboot of something for the sake of making a film.Definitely could not cope with having to watch this a second time. Once was a lot more than enough for me.",
    "22": "As Queen Victoria often said regarding Sherlock Holmes, \"The hat makes the man.\" I think that Willy's topper from his latest cinematic outing is his best head covering of all three films. The milliner for this movie did a great job in matching head-wear to character to actor. This picture deserves at least a nomination in the \"Best Costume\" category on the basis of Willy's derby alone. Though some viewers may quibble that when the Chocolate Cartel blows up the ship onto which they've lured their rival toward the close of this story his hat should have disappeared as he swam miles to shore, this criticism overlooks the fact that Willy is a magician, so his hat obviously is magical, too. The film crew even included a Magic Consultant. In summary, this prequel gets a big boost from its attention to detail, particularly when it comes to hats.",
    "23": "This musical sucks. I dislike musicals in general but this one was the worse. There was a song every 3 seconds, and they were not even good and took attention away from the actual plot. I also wanted to watch this movie because I thought it would be about wonka giving away the factory but it wasn't even about that. The actors were not good either and the plot wasn't good either. All in all there could have been major improvements to the song, plot, and the actor in the movie. I wound not recommend this movie to anyone and left the movie too. Please don't watch this if you value your time and money.",
    "24": "Of course they wouldn't advertise this movie as a musical. Had they done so I wouldn't have wasted my time. Don't go thinking this will be the classical Gene Wilder Willy Wonka. This movie appeared to have so much potential, but in reality the previews hyped it up. Can't really call it a prequel when it doesn't really relate to the original movie. The songs were bad. Timothee Chalamet tries to pull off The Greatest Showman impression and comes up short. A typical cash grab attempt by the movie studios... I recommend to wait until it streams somewhere... Almost as bad as the Marvels musical scenes... Almost!",
    "25": "This film is nothing like the older Willy Wonka films and is a huge disappointment. The story is altered a bit without giving too much away but it's not interesting enough to hold your attention. The acting is pretty average, although better in comparison to the other aspects of the film such as its humour. That's my next point, it's not funny at all. I maybe gave a little smile at 1 or 2 moments but that is all, which makes this film a failure as a comedy movie. The older Wonka films had much better humour and far better acting, therefore resulting in a much more enjoyable experience.The music is also distractingly irritating, and is certain to break windows. I regret seeing this and am dissapointed as I enjoyed the older films.Maybe young children will enjoy it but if you don't have any then I would give it a miss without a doubt.",
    "26": "As a whole I didn't mind the film. It's targeted really only for children this time around and that's all well and fine, just not what I expected. The use of ridiculously stereotyped British people in the form of the 2 hotel proprietors that essentially kidnap Wonka into slavery really made me hate every minute they were on screen, which was way too much time. And not because they were playing deplorable people, but because the film no longer felt any semblance of real with their over the top portrayals. The music itself was also quite a step down from the originals music. The only saving grace of this film was Hugh Grant and he's barely in the film. The whimsy of Wonka as played by Chalamet was uncomfortable and plain weird to watch at times.",
    "27": "When the previews for \"Wonka\" first arrived, I knew instantly that I needed to see it. \"Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory\" was a childhood favorite of mine. This movie did not disappoint!Paul King and Simon Farnby did an exceptional job crafting the genesis story of Willie Wonka with wonderful homage to the Gene Wilder orginal. Timothee Chalamet is superb as the young Willy, and he actually can sing and dance! Bringing me to the music! The numbers were great; superb lyrics and execution. Bonus: MR. CARSON (Jim Carter) SINGS!!! (Downton Abby). Loved the story, loved the characters. Calah Lane as \"Noodle\" is incredible! Great casting all the way around!And I have to admit that when Wonka sings \"Pure Imagination\", it brought a tear to my eye.Loved it. With all of my 62 year old heart, I loved it.",
    "28": "I had no interest in seeing Wonka. Just like Solo: A Star Wars Story, I didn't need a movie about Willy Wonka's backstory; his real story is in the main story of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Sometimes less is more, and leaving his backstory out gives him more mystery and intrigue. I liked Timothee Chalamet as Wonka well enough, he's got great charisma, and all of the other cast do a great job too. The songs are really hit or miss, and most feel like songs I've heard in lesser known musicals before. It's passable for a Willy Wonka origin story. I appreciated the characters love of chocolate and wonder. But I think a movie like 2000s Chocolat (ironically staring Johnny Depp) plays with the love of chocolate and fantasy better, I'd recommend it more than this. Maybe giving Wonka the Greatest Showman set up would've helped this movie more. If you're a Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory fan, this probably won't do much for you. I'll give it a solid 6 out of 10.",
    "29": "If like me you've spent the last I don't know thirty plus years of your life watching Charlie and the chocolate factory during the Christmas period you'll really enjoy this.It's obviously really different from the original but it still manages to capture the vibe and keep you engaged throughout with little Easter eggs, songs and it's many hilarious moments.I'm a sucker for a good holiday movie and that's what this felt like, it outshines the Depp remake by miles and serves as a perfect addition to the wonka universe.I'd definitely recommend this one especially as a family movie. It might have just made its way onto my yearly Christmas watchlist.",
    "30": "First of all, it's a musical, and it's not a bad musical, because the songs are cool and there are not a million of them, so they don't get boring.All the actors are perfectly suited to their roles of Roald Dahl's comic characters, and this atmosphere is conveyed here even better than in the adaptation of Matilda or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with Johnny Depp.I caught a few clichés, but it's not that it's terrible, because the strong point of this movie is the atmosphere, not the plot. I was in a good mood after watching it.P. S. I was very upset not to see the green minicar throughout the movie.",
    "31": "The actors in the movie are people who will drive you crazy with excitement. Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant, Olivia Colman. All of them are names that have gone far beyond proving themselves. Our lead character, Timothée Chalamet, is young but has done some very good acting lately. They all fulfilled their roles very well. The script is pretty average, although it has a few shining parts. The main material is very suitable for high quality work without any boundaries in terms of scenario, stage art and musicality. The main work, Charlie's Chocolate Factory, is a work about pushing the limits of imagination. Even though there were a few fantastic elements in the movie, it felt quite weak to me in this aspect. It feels a little sad to imagine what this film could have been in the hands of a visionary.",
    "32": "This is a bad movie i didn't know it was a musican so it was a suprise i didn't like at all. It was a movie that mabye had a somewhat good story but there were songs every 5 minutes and they were so predictible that me and my friend could predict every one.There were no good joles all of them were too old or just too bad to consider a GOOD joke.There were also good charecters but there were to much bad ones to go with them.There are some poor trys at teaching some lessons like don't trust stranges and such but it wasn't some good trys and it is obviously made for children of younger age allthou it is 12+\nAnd the movie is so boring that I wrote this whole review while the movie is playing.",
    "33": "The castings for this movie was perfect. Was a bit goofy but charming and fun. It had alot of heart in the movie and really made it fun for the audience. The story line was very simple which i apprecaited for this movie. I did not need a complex story line simple wonka wanted to help and sell chocolate and had to overcome obsticales with a dream that made wonka extremly lovable. Overall the scenes were very over the top but it worked for this movie. I really enjoyed it under the timefrane and really was a feel good christmas movie. This was an incredible prequel and would easily want to see more.",
    "34": "Wonka is a 2023 musical fantasy starring Timothy Chalamet,Hugh Grant,Jim Carter,Olivia Coleman,Keegan Michael Key and Matt Lucas. Directed by Paul King(Paddington),the story tells the tale of Willy Wonka(Chalamet) who dreams of opening up his own chocolate store. But he ends up being stuck in a bnb owned by an evil couple (Coleman)who uses their guests as slaves. So Willy decides to make his dream a reality by asking the slaves to help him create a chocolate store in spit of the evil chocolaters and of course the evil couple. Will he succeed in his dreams?.Overall I enjoyed this film. The songs are good but not as memorable as say The Greatest Showman(they are more like Mary Poppins Returns)and the story has been done before so many times. Hugh Grant had me in stitches throughout as the Oompa Loompa.If you enjoyed Mary Poppins Returns or The Greatest Showman then you'll love this film. Also features Rowan Atkinson as a priest.",
    "35": "The original Willy Wonka is one of my favorite movies of all time, so I went into this with high expectations. I feel like this just fell short a bit. The songs in the movie were quite simple and the lyrics predictable and uninteresting; at one point I even guessed what words were coming next. I really wanted to fall in love with it but it felt like it was trying too hard and consistently falling short. I felt like it lacked the magic of the original. I understand this was a prequel and a lot of the magic of the factory hadn't been realized yet but I still wished there was more candy in the movie too.For me, Wonka was extremely witty and clever, and made remarks that are simply unforgettable. This Wonka lacked that presence. Slugworth was very entertaining to watch- witty, animated, sarcastic, and funny. He was probably my favorite character in this version.",
    "36": "I was skeptical going into this one & of course when I first heard about it, but nonetheless, went into seeing it as I have seen the 1971 Original & 2005 Remake of the Charlie & The Chocolate Factory Films.With dreams of opening a shop in a city renowned for its chocolate, a young and poor Willy Wonka discovers that the industry is run by a cartel of greedy chocolatiers.I found the film to be quite good! It's got a good story, good characters & plenty of visuals & dazzling ace effects. Even for a musical, it's ace & really well made! The films a little long at 1 hour & 50 minutes & does drag a tad bit, but it's good with some not bad songs that are well shot when the actors dance & break into song!Overall, it's a pretty good film! Visually stunning, great characters & pretty good story with a feel good ending!7/10.",
    "37": "It took me awhile to feel comfortable with the singing and the characters, and I remember distinctly wondering if was I going to \"feel it\", but at some point the movie sucked me in and I felt like a kid again! Sure it was predictable as some mentioned, but I felt the way this movie delivered was creative and imaginative. I know others around me were feeling it too because we laughed together and struggled to hold back tears towards the end. Worth the hype. Worth my time. Worth my money. Oh yeah, there were twenty six minutes of previews and targeted ads past the official start time. If you bring your kids, don't arrive early.",

They did a great job of using visuals to capture that child-like feeling of imagination and wonderment. More than anything I think this movie has a lot of charm. The main cast is very likable and easy to route for, but even the \"bad guys\" made a lasting impact and I always looked forward to seeing them in scenes.

    "41": "Wonka is a prequel to the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. This prequel was directed and partly written by Paul King, the director of the two Paddington films.Young Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) tries to bring more flavor to the world with his own unique chocolate. When he tries to do this with his own chocolate sales, Willy gets into trouble with the chocolate cartel. This cartel is run by Slugworth (Patterson Joseph), who runs the chocolate trade in more corrupt, dishonest ways.Together with Noodle (Calah Lane) and the fellow residents of Willy's new apartment complex, they secretly try to go against Slugworth's chocolate trade, so that people can enjoy different chocolates and other sweets from Willy Wonka's unique recipes and preparation methods in fairer ways. .\nThe book adaptation of Roald Dahl, his book about Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory, was well received around 1971. They managed to make this film unique, once in the chocolate factory with colorful environments filled with different sweets. What further made this film unique was the acting of Gene Wilder, who managed to make the role of Willy Wonka his own with his own creative input.In 2005, the film was remade with Johnny Depp playing the role of Willy Wonka. This remake was directed by Tim Burton, who also gave the film his own twist, which made the film a bit more unusual and dark.Now with this prequel to Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, Timothée Chalamet gets the opportunity to make the role and the origin story a little more personal and develop it further. Unfortunately, he continues to play the role a bit safer and within the lines. As a result, the younger version of Willy Wonka misses his mysterious, special sides. Timothée Chalamet's singing is good, but seems a bit less pure compared to Gene Wilder's singing. Fortunately, other cast members know how to provide better and more appropriate singing, such as Calah Lane.In the original film, it takes about the first 45 minutes of the film for Willy Wonka's character to emerge in the film. In this prequel you get to see this character from the beginning, but after about an hour and fifteen minutes his fledgling chocolate factory really makes an appearance. In the beginning you follow Willy Wonka more as an illegal street seller of chocolate, while he tries to stay out of the hands of the chocolate cartel. This gives the film a different atmosphere. Once you get closer to the chocolate factory, the film may seem a bit more familiar. However, the film does miss some of the unique magical environments that the original film had. In the original film, Willy Wonka's helpers, the Oompa Loompas, were played by small actors. In this film, an Oompa Loompa is played by Hugh Grant, who is transformed into Oompa Loompa with special effects. This way, credibility is lost somewhat. Sometimes it can also come across as a bit unusual thanks to the visual effects. Because more use is made of visual effects, this film may seem less believable compared to the original film.This way, this film can become a new youth film for the modern generation, who can grow up with this film. Furthermore, the film may also be entertaining for fans of Timothée Chalamet.",

He was great as Wonka!Hugh Grant was great as an Oompa Loompa, it was very funny seeing him as a small orange man with green hair.I loved the new characters like Noodle, Mrs. Scrubitt, Bleacher, the 3 chocolate cartels and there were so many more and they were all great!This version of Wonka has nothing to do with the previous movies \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" or \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" it is completely different, it is about how Willy Wonka became the famous chocolatier we know now.There were many musical numbers including new versions of \"Pure Imagination\" and \"Oompa Loompa\" it was very nostalgic and nice to hear again. The Original Score is amazing, and I haven't stoped listening to it since it came out, it's just something else, it's magic! To be honest I cried when Timothée started singing \"Pure Imagination\".There is a scene where Wonka and Noodle are running away from the zoo and singing as well as dancing and that specific scene melted my heart, it was so sweet and nice.Timothee brought a new version of Wonka to the world, there are references to the Gene Wilder Wonka and when you notice them there is a little spark in you which makes you smile! The movie is filled with love, happiness and hope as well as adventure.I really recommend going and watching this movie in the theatre with your family, friends and loved ones in general, it brings a bit of hope to you and it was just so magical.The cast was amazing and they all did an amazing job!\"Everything in the world started with a dream\" 🍫🎩",
    "57": "WonkaThis film continues a pattern I've seen in films recently where the main character hides their own pain by producing things that make other people happy, insisting that it boosts their own happiness. This, as expected, is not true, as the underlying pain continues even after a goal is reached. With Wonka, he produces chocolates of varying exotic and magical degrees so that when he reaches a goal of perceived success, that his pain will lessen or end. I'm reading into this too much, but I couldn't help but picture what the movie would have been like if chocolate has been replaced by drug addiction. They certain portray chocolate as a drug, even using the word cartel to describe those who sell their product.What follows next is a wacky and musical journey where others join his cause in order to escape literal but ridiculous imprisonment. The motives of the others are touched on, but attention is mostly paid to Noodle, an orphan girl. There are inconsistenices in the storyline about the nature of perceived corruption in law enforcement and about the ease of sneaking out of a years long depiction of slavery after it is first deemed impossible.However, I still loved the movie enough to look past that due to the use of colors, songs, wild exuberance, an elegant giraffe, and a silly character played by Rowan Atkinson. In accordance with the chocolate equals drugs, even the members of the church become corrupt to continue receiving their \"fix\".Of course, the movie ends as expected, with Wonka building his famous factory, to continue producing a better form of addictive substances. Maybe my addictive personality found joy in this never ending cycle of taking or making more of something to lessen one's own pain. Even with Wonka letting go of his original motive for making chocolate, he continues to do so, to inspire happiness in a dreary existence.Yes I loved it and recommend it, but it didn't sit right after thinking too much. Face value: it's a sweet treat with happy endings.",

    "61": "The original 1971 Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder is a scrumdiddlyumptious classic, while the remake by Tim Burton with Johnny Depp has its tasty moments, I heard about this prequel to the Roald Dahl story almost a year before its release, I was looking forward to it, produced by David Heyman (Harry Potter), co-written and directed by Paul King (Paddington). Basically, aspiring magician, inventor and chocolate maker Willy Wonka (Golden Globe nominated Timothée Chalamet) arrives in the big city to seek his fortune and open a chocolate shop at the Galeries Gourmet. He quickly burns through his small savings and finds a laundry/boarding house to stay the night. But the owner Mrs. Scrubitt (Olvia Colman) is a devious woman, along with her henchman Bleacher (Tom Davis). Orphan girl Noodle (introducing Calah Lane), who stays at Scrubitt's, warns Willy to read the small print, but he is illiterate and signs the contract regardless. Wonka is confident that he can draw in customers for his chocolate at the Galeries Gourmet and sells his \"hoverchocs\" which make those who eat them fly. The three main chocolatiers of the galleria, Mr. Arthur Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Mr. Prodnose (Matt Lucas) and Mr. Fickelgruber (The Wrong Mans' Mathew Baynton), mock Wonka's chocolates but are secretly impressed by their taste and his ingenuity and see him as a threat to their business. They call the Chief of Police (Keegan-Michael Key) who confiscates his earnings. Unable to pay Scrubitt, Willy is consequently forced to work down in the launderette for up to 10,000 days (27 years) to pay his debt. The other workers trapped in Scrubitt's basement are accountant Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), plumber Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), telephone operator Lottie Bell (EastEnders' Rakhee Thakrar), comedian Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher). Abacus tells Willy that Slugworth, Prodnose, and Fickelgruber are the \"Chocolate Cartel\" and are in cahoots to eliminate any competition. The Cartel's base of operations is located beneath a cathedral, run by the corrupt Father Julius (Rowan Atkinson) and his \"chocoholic\" monks, where they store a large container of chocolate. Wanting to get out and satisfy the public with his chocolates, Willy plans to distract Scrubitt and Bleacher, manipulating them into falling in love with each other, so that he can sneak out, with the help of Noodle. On his first trip out, Willy is successful in making sales, but the Chocolate Cartel exploits the Chief's love of chocolates to threaten Wonka into leaving town. Willy ignores the warning and continues to sell chocolate, becoming a sensation with the public. Noodle teaches him how to read, and he avoids the police using magic tricks, and sewage drains as escape routes. After introducing Noodle to her first piece of chocolate, Willy explains that his love for chocolate came from his mother (Sally Hawkins), who made him one last chocolate bar before she passed away. Willy has told Noodle that various times he has made chocolate, his jars have been stolen by a mysterious \"orange man\", who has been stalking him for years, but she does not believe him. One night, Willy and Noodle travel to the local zoo to milk a giraffe to create his signature chocolate using Giraffe milk. The two of them recruit Abacus, Piper, Larry, and Lottie to help him sell chocolates to pay their debts while evading Scrubitt and the Chief. Meanwhile, Willy catches the \"orange man\" who has been stealing his chocolates, an Oompa-Loompa named Lofty (Hugh Grant). Years ago, Willy took precious cocoa beans from Loompa Land, which Lofty was watching, and he wants Willy to pay him back in chocolate. Willy's group earns enough money to open his dream chocolate store in the galleria to an excited crowd. However, the Chief and the Chocolate Cartel have got wind of this, and they tell Scrubitt about what they have been up to. The Cartel spoils his chocolates, putting yeti sweat into them, causing customers to grow excessive hair and discolour their skin. The angry crowd demand their money back, ransack the place, and cause Wonka's store to burn down. Returning to the launderette, the Cartel confess their sabotage of his business and make Willy an offer. They will pay off all the debts of his friends, and give Noodle a future if he leaves town and stops making chocolate forever. Willy reluctantly accepts the offer and boards a boat that night. Lofty joins Willy aboard the boat and motivates him to return and fight back against the Cartel before they abandon ship after finding a bomb set to explode. With their debts paid, Abacus, Piper, Larry, and Lottie are released from the launderette, but Slugworth pays Scrubitt to refrain from releasing Noodle. Willy returns and his group rescue Noodle; Willy discovered she is the daughter of Slugworth's dead brother. Noodle's mother left her with Slugworth, but he realised she could claim the family fortune when she grows up. Slugworth dumped his niece with Scrubitt and lied to her mother that she had died. Willy and his friends put together a plan to expose the Cartel using an accounts book Abacus had spotted when he worked for Slugworth. Releasing the giraffe into the cathedral as a distraction, Willy and Noodle go beneath ground to find the book but are cornered by the Cartel. They are trapped in the container where they are to be drowned in chocolate. Before entering, Willy asks the Cartel to give a jar of hover chocs to the Oompa-Loompa to repay his debts, but the three men and Father Julius eat the chocolates, and Lofty appears and rescues Willy and Noodle. Confronting the Cartel and the Chief outside, Willy and Noodle expose their actions to the police and the public revealing the contents of the account book, and their chocolate is released through a water fountain, ruining their business. The Cartel uncontrollably levitates due to the hover chocs, while the Chief of Police is arrested. The crowd celebrates by tasting the chocolate containing Willy's ingredients. Willy unwraps his mother's chocolate bar, finding a golden ticket with a last message from his mother telling him that chocolate is best shared. Willy shares his mother's chocolate with his friends. Willy helps Noodle reunite with her birth mother, Dorothy Smith (Tracy Ifeachor), who works in the library. Willy pays off his debt to Lofty, but he says he could do with some help when he opens a new factory, he needs a \"Chief Taster\". Willy purchases an abandoned castle and with Lofty helps to build the Wonka factory. Meanwhile, Scrubitt and Bleacher are arrested trying to hide evidence of sabotaging Wonka's shop, and eating his chocolates, they are turned into the Twits. Also starring Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Officer Affable, Simon Farnaby (also writing) as Zoo Security Guard Basil, Charlotte Ritchie as Barbara, Phil Wang as Colin, Ellie White as Gwennie (Mistress of the Keys), Sophie Winkleman as The Countess, Murray McArthur as Ship Captain, Peep Show's Isy Suttie as Fruit & Veg Vendor, Colin O'Brien as Young Willy Wonka, Rufus Jones as Jenkins, Tim Fitzhigham as Sinister Ship Captain, Susie Fairfax as Abacus Crunch's Wife, Coronation Street's Ian Bartholomew as Sceptical Old Man, Justin Edwards as Green-Skinned Customer, Miranda's Dominic Coleman as Donovan, and Alison Pargeter as Wendy Chucklesworth. Chalamet is likeable as the aspiring constantly positive upcoming candy man, Colman and Davis are a great double act as the mean workhouse owners, Joseph, Lucas and Baynton enjoy themselves as the pantomime villains, young Lane gives a confident performance as Wonka's assistant, and Grant as the pompous wisecracking little creature is hilarious, spotting recognisable acting and comic talents is the cast is fun as well. There are some nice songs written by The Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon, including \"A Hatful of Dreams\", \"You've Never Had Chocolate Like This\" and \"A World of Your Own\", and the return of classic songs \"The Oompa-Loompa Song\" and \"Pure Imagination\" with slightly altered lyrics is good. As an origins story for the young chocolate factory character it works well, it is full of likeable characters, a charming Dickensian atmosphere, with colourful costumes and set pieces, there are some good laughs to be had, the family will all have fun with this little bite of magic, a sweet and enjoyable musical fantasy. Very good!",
    "62": "The background story of candy-maker Willy Wonka, a child magician-turned-chocolate lover who arrives in a thriving metropolis and immediately runs afoul of lying/cheating/thieving chocolate sovereign Arthur Slugworth. Wonka (an illiterate!) is railroaded by evil hoteliers and is sentenced to work in the washer-room, where he befriends an urchin and conspires to usurp Slugworth with his delicious chocolates made with giraffe's milk. This CGI nightmare from director Paul King--targeted at restless kids raised on Taylor Swift videos--opens with the tinkling notes of \"Pure Imagination\" from 1971's \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" (and goes on to use that song plus \"The Oompa-Loompa Song\"). That's a nice touch, yet the dreary action that takes place down in the dark brown-and-beige washer-room is enlivened only by the \"Scrub Scrub\" number. The plot, concocted by King and Simon Farnaby from King's original treatment, isn't involving: Wonka escapes to open his own shop--across the square from Slugworth's building--only to have his candy poisoned, causing the crowds to turn on him and burn the place down (the urchin solemnly tells Willy, \"We can rebuild\", while the audience likely asks, \"Can't that wait for the sequel?\"). King's sense of humor is of the dryly dubious kind found in today's kids' movies, wherein wonderment and magic are greeted with eye-rolling skepticism. When crowds gather (and they do--at regular intervals), no one is overly-surprised when magic chocolates make Slugworth and his flunkies levitate. This is a movie about wonderment without any wonder in it--the whiplash editing eliminates it. In the lead, red-nosed Timothée Chalamet doesn't possess a strong singing or speaking voice--nor, indeed, a strong visual presence (he's forgettable in the role). Some of the supporting players are marginally better, though the casting of Paterson Joseph as the lips-pursing Slugworth doesn't pay off (he's whispery-intimidating but drip-dry and vacant, like the pimps in the blaxploitation movies). The CGI will probably please those who can't get along without it, but it looks cheap when focusing on Hugh Grant as Wonka's chocolate-stealing nemesis; we can't get an idea of this Oompa-Loompa's size, which seems to change, nor his personality (he's brash and yet benign). The intermittent musical numbers give the film a bit of a lift, but not enough, and a vengeful plan for Wonka that lands him in a rising pool of chocolate (\"Death by chocolate!\") puts a damper on the whole thing. ** from ****",
    "63": "I honestly loved this movie! I highly recommend it to everyone. It was fun to watch and kept me intrigued the whole time. It's \"out there\" enough to keep things interesting, but I wasn't confused or distracted by the fun themes and songs. It was so fun to watch Timothy act in this role. He and the whole cast made it so fun to watch. It was uplifting and had a great, wholesome message. I'm not one to pick apart a movie, and love to go see a new movie every week. This was at the top of my list from the past few movies I've seen. If you want to have fun and like a kid again, this is the movie for you!",
    "64": "With all due respect to fans of Tim Burton's version, I think this prequel opus is a success: colors, songs, fantasy... that's exactly what you'd expect from a film on Willy Wonka, isn't it?According to my view, this « sweet fantastic reality » created by the sets, costumes and special effects is very accomplished, and helps us to immerse in Wonka's adventures to fullfill his dreams: set up his own business and share the magic of his chocolate with the rest of the world. Olivia Colman and Calah Lane are excellent all along, as is Timothée Chalamet, who once again rises to the challenges of his role. Of course, many will be unable to resist making comparisons with Johnny Depp's previous performance, but in my opinion, Mr. Chalamet has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. A perfect Christmas film for young and less young curious ones!",
    "65": "It was very hard to stay awake to watch this. It was even terrifying to see the actors to sing and dance. Lol They are probably good actors. The problem is the script. Such a waste of Timothee. The story wasn't connected to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which was very disappointing. Chocolates didn't look good at all. Wonka looked already rich and successful guy from the beginning which was funny. Western people seem to like the first Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but I like the second one the best. Love Tim Burton's world. If I have to say something good about this movie, it's Oompa-Loompa's dance, but why did they cast Hugh Grant for Oompa-Loompa?",
    "66": "2.5 out of 5 stars.Wonka is a pretty bad fantasy musical film that is an origin story to Willy Wonka. And how he came to be before he made his factory. Starting off poor. Coming across greedy and corrupt chocolatiers.Plot is decent. Timothee Chalamet did a great job with the performance. The script is cheesy. The humor is tacky and more aiming for the children audience. The musical sequences i did find to be quite forgettable. It was hard to feel emotional with the characters. Fans of Willy Wonka will enjoy this film more. With its magical direction. Hugh Grant playing an Oompa Loompa. And the cheesy humor.",
    "67": "Charlie and the chocolate factory is my all time favourite movie (2005 version). I watch it 2 times every year; on christmas eve and during the easter Holiday. To be honest i was counting down the days until this premiere since they announced it, which was nearly a year!I was expecting it to be a little similar to the originals and that it would have SOMETHING to do with christmas, however it didnt. I felt like I was watching Oliver Twist, not willy wonka. What disappointed me the most was the storyline. We get to know some of Wonkas childhood in Charlie and the chocolate factory, for instance that he grew up with a prestigious dentist father (dr.wonka) who refused him chocolate/candy and he was sent away for chosing candy over his father at the age of 11. In this movie the story is completely different, showing us a loving (poor) mother who makes him chocolate from scratch on their houseboat. He persues chocolate in the hopes of seeing her again. This doesnt fit what we already know, and I prefer the original version. It would be much better if they went with this in my opinion. I always assumed that he wanted to prove his father wrong, that was his motivation to success. The end of Charlie and the chocolate factory where he made his father proud was moving.Also, the discovery of the tonka beans and their magic is a big part of Charlie and the chocolate factory. The «little man with green hair and orange skin» doesnt look like an Oompa-Loompa at all. He also talks english, not their language (which was fun). And the version of him going there and just finding 4 of their beans is BORING compared to how it was originally. He basically just saw them right away, took them and left. It is a lovely movie, but there is a lot of signing (the songs arent even that great) and some scenes just doesnt make any sense. The scene where they milk the giraffe and start signing is cringy. I barely managed to watch it finish. All in all a fairly good movie, but nothing compared to Charlie and the chocolate factory. I love that movie and all the Harry Potter movies (same creators), but this is just average. Sorry. It felt rushed and just did not fill my expectations. Hopefully someone else chares my opinion and makes a even better version in the future.",
    "68": "I attended the premiere of this movie, and was not disappointed. You will definitely expect a well rounded, cozy and all around funny affair for all ages with this film - and very much a worthy addition to the traditions of great and thrilling blockbusters around christmas times.Like a majority of people, I have of course watched the original film, yet it has been quite a few years. This film is more of a new adaptation of the Roald Dahl novel rather than a traditional prequel, however, so it stands well on its own. But like many great homages, it does pay its tribute to the original film in many clever ways.It is an all around funny, cozy and fun affair in the style of a great matinee adventure - splendid, colorful and memorable characters, catchy and memorable soundtracks and things that will stretch your imagination, to say the least!Definitely a great family adventure in the vein of Doctor Dolittle, The Wizard of Oz, or, dare I even say, The Sound of Music, to an extent.Overall, definitely a highlight of the year, highly recommended for everyone, regardless of age. I am sure most will appreciate this.",
    "69": "It's an entertaining prequel to Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory(1971), tells the story of Willy Wonka, and his journey make great chocolate for the world to enjoy, but can he overcome the composition?Musical scenes are enjoyable, the movie is such an enjoyable ride, If you enjoyed the original, then I hope you'll give this prequel a try. Timothee Chalamet really gets in the role of Willy Wonka without trying to copy Gene Wilder, clearly playing the part in his own way, also the rest of the cast are pretty good also. This movie really stands on it's own, guaranteeing to the audience that have seen the original.",
    "70": "I don't know what the intent of this movie was, but it's a far cry from the original. Decent story, but filled with useless musical numbers that add zero to the plot. There's no way to sugar coat it, it's a musical. There are so many different ways they could have gone as a prequel. There's none of the mysterious and slightly dark scenes like the original. I feel like the Wonka in the new one doesn't represent the original Wonka. I may be hung up on the endless singing, but this version is the epitome of what is being pushed out lately. Don't go to this movie expecting anything that is like or even aligns with the original Wonka. Disappointing.",
    "71": "I don't expect to enjoy this movie that much, but turns out this is became my favorite movie this year. The plot was predictable and simple, i feel like for this one the problem isn't complicated enough and wonka seems too naive, yet somewhat it what makes it feels really special. It is very different from the previous two movies, and it is refreshing but still feels nostalgic. I was laughing, and crying (of course) and i usually find musical movies boring, but i love every single song here. Timothee and those other great actors hit those note delicately. My inner child was filled with so much happiness. Overall it's a perfect holiday movie.",
    "72": "On paper, Wonka is a cynical cash grab of an idea but in the hands of the extremely talented duo of Paul King and Simon Farnaby it becomes another heartwarming story of a kind person who just wants to make the world a better place. Even if it feels its run time more than King and Faranby's previous work it still remains thoroughly entertaining and emotionally investing.Timothée Chalamet lacks the darker edge with this interpretation of Willy Wonka and that really doesn't matter considering what the film is going for. His Wonka is innocent to a fault, morally pure with a high level of quirk that Chalamet is able to communicate in his enunciation and movement. It's a nice change of pace compared to his usual roles.The supporting cast is full of comedians who take it in turns stealing scenes. Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa is an uncanny highlight who takes a while to appear and is absolutely worth the wait. Paterson Joseph excels at playing a full on pantomime villain complimented by Matt Lucas and Matthew Baynton to make for a delightfully evil trio.Paul King's direction brings the expected whimsy with a nice level of energy to the musical numbers. The songs by Neil Hannon are generally fine, suitably entertaining in the moment without staying power so it successfully goes back to Pure Imagination a few times, with Joby Talbot's score happily sprinkling it in throughout.",
    "73": "Proving that his work on the one two punch that was Paddington and then it's universally praised sequel was not per chance, British director Paul King has managed to bring the same amount of energy, charm, heart and smarts he delivered with his marmalade loving bear to this high profile Willy Wonka prequel that should become the crowd pleasing hit of this years festive/holiday period.Utilising his comedy background and career making work on the cult UK TV series The Mighty Boosh (fans of which will be pleased to see a key role for Rich Fulcher here), King ensures that his musical infused adventure that follows Timothée Chalamet's young Willy Wonka during his first attempts to conquer the chocolate world with his magical inventions and colorful showmanship, is a film that constantly is on the move and one that ensures it's filled to the brim with wonder, whimsy and wackiness that should find it appealing to a wide ranging age-group and audience.It's not as though the world was exactly crying out to find out more about the beloved character many of us fell in love with either in Roald Dahl's original book or the Gene Wilder starring classic film from 1971 but King and his screenwriting partner Simon Farnaby instantly make us engaged and interested in this tale that has a wide ranging reach and works in a number of facets without ever losing momentum.Rarely pausing for breath between its colourful character interactions, enjoyable song and dance numbers and more poignant aspects that make Wonka more than just all sugar and no substance, King's enjoyable ride harbours a clear labour of love at its core that gels perfectly with its more old-school film-making vibe and delivery that once more acts as an example that Hollywood's incessant nature to try and be \"hip\" and boundary pushing isn't always needed to find a winning formula.Within King's winning Wonka formula he has managed to create and gift a number of memorably fun performances from his talented cast and while Chalamet gives it his best shot in easily his most challenging performance yet, his role as Willy Wonka doesn't always seem ideally suited to his acting sensibilities, it's in the supporting cast that Wonka finds its comedic gold.From Olivia Colman's yellow-toothed nasty Mrs. Scrubbit, Tom Davis's wild-haired Bleacher, Keegan-Michael Key's sweet-toothed police chief and Hugh Grant's (bizarrely controversial) scene-stealing Oompa-Loompa, Wonka's cast of newbies and industry vets alike all have a blast playing their parts here and Wonka's overall feeling and end result seems to be the product of a film that was a lot of fun to make and bring to life.There may not be any groundbreaking new messages taking place here and I don't suspect Wonka will ever be regarded as the type of family friendly all-time classic as its original source material or first film iteration are seen as but it would take a hard-hearted and Scrubbit like viewer to not find enjoyment from such an entertaining and imaginative new take on one of the worlds most well-known properties.Final Say -Another resounding success for director Paul King, who has here further established his reputation as the leader of family friendly cinematic adventures, Wonka is a charming and enjoyable big screen ride that deserves to be this years most resounding holiday hit.4 unsolved murders out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",
    "74": "Memories of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka performance come to mind and whereas his 1971 version was magical and witty, this 2023 version of Wonka is a bit underwhelming to be honest...The bad: the songs just dont excite me. They just dont. They are not terrible, but quite average. The songs in the 1971 version of Willy Wonka were superb. I can still remember them to this very day!More bad: there is a lack of magic and surprise. The story just doesnt take me on a trip like the original did. Sorry, that I keep comparing this one to the original. Perhaps I shouldnt?Not any good then? This movie will surely please the young kids who ofcourse are the target audience for this movie. It's a nice fantasy musical movie for sure, with a bunch of TERRIFIC English actors, who lift this movie up. Timothee Chalamet did an allright job as well.Nothing to really dislike about it, but nothing to get really excited about it either unfortunately, for me as a grownup fan of the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder.",
    "75": "Ever wonder how Willy Wonka made it, how he would one day be in a position to one day send out those golden tickets? This film gives us Willy Wonka's early years.I had high hopes for it, I was not disappointed, I loved it. A movie of pure fantasy, wonder and escapism, this really was a wonderful, pre Christmas sweet treat.I loved the story, the energy, the laughs, and best of all, a killer performance from Timothée Chalamet, I thought he was fabulous, not quite sure i see him turning into Gene Wilder or Johnny Drop's character, perhaps the former. Olivia Colman, as always very good.If I had one criticism, I'd say that it's perhaps just a little too over produced, a little too stagey at times, clearly a painstaking amount of time and effort went into this, but in this instance, less could have been more.Is this the reason why Dune 2 was delayed? With Chalamet rightly deserving The plaudits for his performance here?8/10.",
    "76": "I really had high hopes for this movie. Finally, I thought, Hollywood can take a step back from their incessant superhero schlock and do something genuinely creative and genuinely entertaining. And it seemed to be getting good reviews!Within the first thirty minutes, however, it becomes apparent this is a very drab, tedious affair. Somehow they managed to turn Willy Wonka into a joyless tale. If anything, it seemed to be slipping into \"Les Miz\" territory, and I was kind of hoping Olivia Colman might just go ahead and belt out \"Master of the House.\"One of the few redeeming qualities is Hugh Grant as a sophisticated Oompa-Loompa. Aside from that, the supporting characters are horrible, the music instantly forgettable, and the plot is muddled and tedious, pulling at your emotions with tales of dead mothers and orphans rather than merry Wonkaesque mayhem.For Pete's sake, they were handed the keys to create Willy Wonka's origin story and they couldn't even make it watchable.Hollywood, just give up.",
    "77": "As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version, I will admit I was hesitant about this film especially after the lackluster trailers. That being said, five minutes into the film I realized I was in for a delicious treat.The simplest way I can describe this new Wonka is beautiful. I remember trying to spot some issues that I could put into this review while watching the film, but honestly there are none. Wonka is like a warm hot chocolate on a winter's day. Everything from the set pieces to the costume design is perfect. All of the actors involved do a great job as well, but I have to say Timothee Chalamet really carries the film.He is a fantastic young Wonka and I don't think any actor his age would've been able to pull it off like he did. I have always loved Timothee Chalamet as an actor, but this film for me cemented him as one of the best of his generation if not the best.Wonka is the only film in years that had me grinning pretty much the entire runtime. I laughed, I cried and by the end was filled with more joy than I have felt in a very long time. If that isn't enough for you to buy a ticket then I don't know what to tell you.",
    "78": "My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timothée Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023. While I would rate it a 4/10, I'd still recommend watching it once to form your own opinion.",
    "79": "Paul King, the director behind the enchanting Paddington films entered the fold to direct a prequel to Gene Wilder's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Unfortunately, this outing is overproduced and overdone. And just like chocolate; some things are best had in moderation. Roald Dahl's work in recent times has regrettably been tampered with to remove language related to race, gender, weight, and mental health that today's readers might deem offensive. This film feels like a continuation of that craven desire to be inoffensive. The result is a slightly safe and garden variety end-product which isn't much of a tribute to Dahl, if it even wanted to be.For me, all things Willy Wonka should be almost like an experiential hallucination; self-contained, a bit mysterious, and open to interpretation, without the need for any elaborate backstory spelling things out. Wonka should be an experience, not a storyboard. He ought be unpredictable, a one-off. In the book he is innovative, flamboyant, stubborn, arrogant, and authoritarian. We saw the innovative and the flamboyant, but none of the rest. Or how those latter qualities might have taken, or were taking, shape. Timothee Chalamet's portrayal, for all its innocent charms and trinkets, simply did not have the comedic and deliciously unpredictable edge of either Wilder or Depp's Wonkas; the dimensionality just wasn't there. That \"edge\" would have bounced off the sassiness of the stubborn Oompa Loompa perfectly, helping the audience to see how Wonka wins them over (besides just a paltry supposed bribe of chocolate tasting). Here, it's Hugh Grant outsmarting, outshining, and outwitting a bumbling wide-smiling, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Wonka in most of the scenes they share. The musical genre of this film wasn't a bad call, given the iconic hit of Wilder's \"Pure Imagination,\" why not try out a musical style? The original songs here could have a little more oomph, though, lyrically and musically. The trio of main villains were excellently cast, with Matt Lucas, Paterson Joseph (stealing the show), and Mathew Baynton. All three were a treat to see on-screen.Overall this film is relatively unchallenging for children compared to Wilder's 1971 work under the original source material, or Tim Burton's satirical 2005 outing. Imagining Willy Wonka as sweet, cloying and one-toned as he's shown here with Chalamet doesn't quite hit the sweet spot.6.8/10.",
    "80": "I would suggest watching only the trailer and, with memories of what you may have seen and read before, let that light up a little \"Pure Imagination,\" and leave it there. Don't go and see this film.The musical is built around the \"Pure imagination\" track from the original movie, however hasn't done much in it's attempts to spring board from there, creating rather a drab and uninspired musical around that!They shouldn't have used that original song, not really, in that it appears to have revealed a considerable lack of musical talent, in so far as the new songs are concerned, within a musical production, in this case!The musical whimpered on throughout a meaningless story, it all felt rather uninspired, with consideration to what came before it, featuring not a single character of interest, going on to fizzle out leaving nothing at all. I'm struggling to write about it in fact, it being almost entirely forgettable.Timothy's Wonka, the character, is actually very good, as are some of the villains within this, however everything else simply fails to leave a mark. Some rather bad story telling in this one. I'm quite shocked about this to be honest!",
    "81": "Wonka, the latest film from director Paul King, takes us on a journey into the fantastical world of Willy Wonka's early life. While the film is visually delightful and boasts a strong performance from Timothée Chalamet, its chaotic story and forgettable music leave it feeling bittersweet.Chalamet shines as a young Willy Wonka, brimming with youthful enthusiasm and boundless creativity. His performance is a welcome departure from the more jaded interpretations of the character, injecting a much-needed dose of innocence and wonder. Olivia Colman and Hugh Grant round out the cast with memorable supporting roles, adding humor and depth to the film.The film's greatest strength lies in its visual feast. The vibrant sets and costumes bring the Chocolate Factory to life in all its fantastical glory, creating a truly immersive experience for the audience. King's signature whimsical style shines through, crafting a lighthearted and enjoyable atmosphere that is sure to captivate children and adults alike.However, Wonka's charm is somewhat diminished by its chaotic story. The plot feels convoluted and lacks focus, making it difficult to follow at times. This is further exacerbated by the film's foray into musical territory. While the songs are visually stunning, they are unfortunately plagued by generic melodies and forgettable lyrics. They ultimately feel disconnected from the narrative, serving as unwelcome interruptions rather than emotional enhancements.While not quite reaching the heights of King's Paddington films, Wonka manages to entertain with its whimsical tone and charming performances. Fans of Chalamet and visually stunning musicals will likely find much to enjoy. However, those seeking a more focused and emotionally resonant experience may find themselves left wanting. Overall, Wonka is a visually delightful and whimsical film that ultimately feels like a mixed bag of treats, leaving one with a taste of both satisfaction and disappointment.",
    "82": "I expected sooo much more from Wonka. Charlie and the Chocolate factory was my favourite book in my childhood, I watched both movies many times and my kids took that passion from me and my wife. We were looking forward to see Wonka, but then we were all disappointed.Movies is not bad, it's fairly entertaining, kids liked it, but we all agreed it's nowhere close to Tim Burton's movie. There was huge potential to bring some new magic into the chocolate world of Willy Wonka, but they failed to do that.During the movie, I never once felt the irresistible craving for chocolate, even though I'm a big fan of sweets. That's an unforgivable mistake. In Burton's film, I enjoyed the world of chocolate, from the beginning until the end. Also, the story is very average, focused mainly on the negative aspects of the world we live in. I don't know if they wanted to make a chocolate Oliver Twist, but the combination of the magical world of chocolate and the harsh realism of Charles Dickens just doesn't work together. I'm not dissatisfied with the film, but I am disappointed because it could and should have been much better, more magical, more appealing, and - tastier.",
    "83": "As a child I grew up absolutely loving Gene Wilder in the role, I didn't care for Johnny Depp, that film was just too weird, along comes Chalamet, pretty good in the part, I just wasn't crazy about the film.I felt as though I was watching a musical somewhere in The West End, lots of musical numbers, and a plot which was there, but more so for the sake of it.1971's film presents us with a world of magic, what child (or adult for that matter) wouldn't have wanted to get into that factory, and didn't end up singing those songs, sadly there's none of that here. It's very well made, it's well acted, all that's missing is the magic.I know I shouldn't be comparing it to the past, it's better than the Depp movie, but not a patch on Wilder's.",
    "84": "Reel Tunez, The Radio Show All About the Movies - Movie Review (12/16/23): \"Wonka\". First thing to know is to NOT expect either previous version of the movie related to the character. It's neither Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp's version. It's not about a kid coming to the factory after getting a gold ticket. Nothing like that.. so don't expect it. This is Willy's return after going to Oompa Loompa Land and wanting to start making chocolate. Knowing that will help you by not having wrong expectations. In this case, Willie goes up against a \"gang of three different chocolatiers\" (one is Slugworth).The movie is worth seeing.. and it's a movie event, but be aware that it certainly feels more like a stage play in some respect as the acting is \"big\".. as if exaggerated and animated, as if it's being played TO an audience.Timothee Chalamet does a nice job as Willy Wonka, but he fortunately doesn't have the craziness of Depp's Wonka, but neither quite the warmth or interesting appeal as Wilder's Wonka. Don't expect Wilder or Depp's Wonkas, and that will also help your expectations.Though this isn't a musical, there's a fair bit of music and songs in this new version. Some of the music is a bit campy, but some of the music and songs WILL bring back fond memories of the Gene Wilder version of \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\".I can say that for about the first half of the movie, I really wasn't enjoying this new version of the movie much.. but after about half way through the movie, I started to like and appreciate this movie for what IT is, and not what it isn't (which is like the other two).As I said, do NOT expect the previous other two Wonka movies and look for something completely new. If you go into it and keep a \"clean slate\" image and appreciate it as a brand new movie, I think you'll like it more.Only other note is that Chalamet sings in the movie, and he's not bad, but he's also not as good as an actor like Hugh Jackman (who is an actor who is also an excellent singer.. and other similar actors with well-trained singing voices).The story line is a good one, and the acting is very good by Wonka and the others who are \"in debt\" (you'll understand if/when you see the movie), but the actors portraying the chocolatiers and police are more like the over-acting characters from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (cartoonish in their over-acting). I'd give this movie a 6.2 and say that it's definitely worth seeing.. and seeing on a big screen. I think if the director had taken this movie a little less \"Chitty Chitty-ish\", I would be up in the mid 7 rating... or even a little higher. Go see Wonka at the theater!",
    "85": "In this latest film, it's clear that something vital is missing. Despite the commendable efforts of a talented cast, they struggle against a script that is both boring and predictable. Their performance, while earnest, cannot elevate the lackluster storyline.The music, often a redeeming feature in such films, sadly fails to deliver. It doesn't capture the audience's interest or invite participation. There's a noticeable lack of catchy tunes or engaging rhythms, making the musical aspect forgettable.Targeted at families, the film surprisingly doesn't resonate with children. The humor is limited and mostly revealed in the trailers, leaving little to be discovered in the theater. The sporadic laughs from the younger viewers are few and far between, indicating the film's failure to connect with its intended audience.A key element missing is the enchanting and quirky charm typically associated with \"Wonka movies.\" This film follows a too straightforward and mundane path, lacking the vibrancy and uniqueness that made previous films stand out. Overall, it's a disappointing experience that lacks the magic and personality needed to make it memorable.",
    "86": "It's a decent origin story about the character of Willy Wonka with good performances, beautiful production, musical tracks, and some good humor. Director Paul King, known for his works on Paddington 1 and 2, does a solid role in handling the setting and themes. The production, color presentations, and the sound designs are great with some good visuals effects and style. All the performances are pretty good as Timothée Chalamet, Calah Lane, Keegan-Michael Key, Hugh Grant and the rest of the cast members are all fun to observe. Rowan Atkinson is always a blast to see.The narrative is standard and King does try to provide some new interesting elements and style to the story and characters and there are some concepts that worked and some that could have been better. On the humor and singing, there are some good singing moments from the cast members and the humor was solid, although some humorous moments felt flat. The character of Willy Wonka is fun to observe but the other characters weren't really that investing or emotionally engaging to connect with. Some dialogue moments could be better.While it's not amazing, the pacing was good and I was still invested to see where the movie was heading. Overall, it's definitely not the best movie from Paul King but it's still entertaining with fun visuals and a good time to watch for the Christmas Season. Now time to eat some chocolate.",
    "87": "Willy Wonka's origin story puts him in London, where he wants to make his long dream come true. With the most unique recipes, he quickly establishes himself as the best chocolate maker which irks the trio of the chocolate cartel. They want him gone in order to have their monopoly. How Wonka finds his unlikely family in London, who support him to make his dream turn into reality as well as take on the trio of villains forms rest of the story.This musical aims to establish this as a sweet film right with Wonka's introduction in the opening credits and it succeeds in that. Atleast 3 songs stood out and the back story to Noodles provide the much needed drama. There is also Wonka's bonding with his own mother. The songs compliment these emotions as well as the wacky ambition of the young chocolate maker. With the likes of Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Keegan-Michael Key in the supporting cast, makes it even easier in keeping the entertainment intact.The humor worked for me throughout and Timothee Chalamet brought some freshness with his take on the titular character. Calah Lane as Noodles was another standout character. The songs keep entertaining and so does the comedy scenes followed enough dose of drama without dragging the story. Ofcourse adult Wonka turned out to be quiet different and this film doesn't try to reveal anything about that, presenting Wonka as this sweetest boy learning to value relationship and succeeding in his dream to open a chocolate shop. It's a screenplay of convenience and there isn't much to complain.",
    "88": "When I saw Paul King (who has done a wonderful job with the Paddington films) was directing the new Wonka a film I must admit I was a little optimistic. But sadly rather than seeing a world of pure imagination it really was a world of pure disappointment.Timothee Chalamet had big shoes to fill, following on from the late great Gene Wilder and living legend Johnny Depp in portraying the titular zany choclatier. Sadly he does not have the charisma of either. It was frustrating that he didn't show any of the crankiness or attitude which made Gene Wilder's version of Wonka so brilliant, instead he's presented as a naive dreamer.As a musical, the songs were so mediocre, I can't imagine the kids will remember any of them once they've left the cinema, barring the ones we've heard before in the other films. The film would have been less tiresome if they had skipped many of these songs.At one point during the film I looked at my watch hopeful that there wasn't too much of the film left, yet it turned out it had only been on for 45 minutes at this point and it still had over an hour to go, I literally couldn't comprehend how that first 45 minutes had felt so much longer.If I can say one nice thing, it's that Olivia Coleman, Paterson Joseph and Rich Fulcher were the hilights and helped make the 2 hour slog just about bearable.",
    "89": "Finally, we can close this unremarkable year with a magical dose of Wonka, which will hopefully wash away the bad memories of the plasticity of Barbie and dreariness of Oppenheimer from the summer.Timothee Chalamet sings effortlessly the songs with clever lyrics by Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy. Give the Oscars to them both already.The production design and art direction provide a dazzling visual feast, so just sit back and enjoy the ride.For better or worse, Willy Wonka here is presented as sweet and warm and lovable although we know him as a much darker personality as played by Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp in the films based on Roald Dahl's book. This is the back story, so I guess he started off more innocently. But I still can't get over Timothee Chalamet's absolutely flawless performance. In this very challenging role which includes singing, his speech and demeanor are pitch perfect.So happy to end this dismal year on such a fabulous note!",
    "90": "\"Wonka\" is a musical fantasy film that serves as an origin story of the character of Willy Wonka from the novel \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" by Roald Dahl. Directed by Paul King (\"Paddington\" 1 and 2) and starring Timothée Chalamet in the lead role, it is a whimsical, fun film that captures the spirit of Roald Dahl and is sure to entertain the younger crowd.In an unnamed European town, inventor and magician Willy Wonka (Timothée Chalamet) arrives to fulfil his childhood dream of running his own chocolate shop. Searching for a place to stay, Wonka stumbles upon a laundromat run by the suspicious Mrs. Scrubbit (Olivia Colman), who offers him a room so long as he signs a contract. After failing to read the fine print, Wonka finds himself in debt to Mrs. Scrubbit and is forced to work around the clock to earn his freedom. While labouring away, Wonka meets five other people who are also indebted to Mrs. Scrubbit's contract; young orphan Noodle (Calah Lane), plumber Piper (Natasha Rothwell), accountant Abacus (Jim Carter), phone operator Lottie (Rakhee Thakrar), and comedian Larry (Rich Fulcher). The five prisoners inform Wonka that the city is controlled by the \"Chocolate Cartel\", a trio of greedy chocolate makers - Mr. Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Mr. Prodnose (Matt Lucas), and Mr. Fickelgruber (Mathew Boynton) - who are fiercely determined to eliminate any potential competition. Wonka teams up with his five new friends to hatch a scheme to bring down the cartel and make his chocolate available to everyone no matter their financial situation.One of the most popular children's stories of the twentieth century is Roald Dahl's \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", the timeless tale of a young boy named Charlie Bucket who is given the opportunity to meet the eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka and visit his mysterious chocolate factory. Since it was first published back in 1964, the story has become a favourite among children the world over, with many like myself growing up reading it at school. Further cementing the story's popularity was the 1971 film adaptation \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" and to a lesser extent Tim Burton's 2005 film \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". Regardless of which of the two films you prefer, their success at the box office proves that the story is as renowned as it ever was, with the character of Willy Wonka attracting the most attention due to his quirky personality. The 2023 film \"Wonka\" gives us an origin story of the title character in a movie that should keep both children and adults entertained for most of the time.Although I'm not entirely sure if we needed to know about the origins of Willy Wonka, this film shows just barely enough about him to still retain that necessary air of mystery without completely ruining his character. When we first meet the young Wonka, he is shown to be ambitious about opening a chocolate shop, singing his passion for the sweet treat loudly from high atop a ship's mast. Upon arriving at his destination, Wonka learns to his dismay that this place is dreary, depressing, and has little time for fun-loving individuals like himself. In fact, no less than three minutes later, Wonka is even forced to pay a fine for daydreaming out in public. Things take a turn for the worst when Wonka is essentially forced into slavery to pay off a huge debt due to his inability to read a contract's fine print as a result of his illiteracy.In spite of all his hardships, Wonka's spirit remains untarnished as he is determined to share his wondrous treats with the world, no matter who or what stands in his way. What I enjoyed here was how the film was able to balance Wonka's confident oddball personality with that of him being the underdog in a new town, staying true to himself but still acknowledging the uphill battle he has to succeed in this harsh world. This is an important message that people of all ages can learn from, since becoming successful is not always an easy task and doing so without sacrificing your own integrity is a challenge within itself. As a result, the otherwise off-putting Willy Wonka becomes a relatable character the audience can find themselves identifying with.Being a musical, there are numerous moments in the film where characters break into song whenever it is necessary for them to communicate their inner monologues. While the songs were all fine and served their intended purpose, I found that most of them weren't all that memorable. The one original musical number I liked the most was near the beginning, where Wonka learns about the fates of his five co-workers/prisoners and how they are doomed to \"Scrub Scrub\" until all their debts are paid. The reason I enjoyed this the most was because it is done in the most Roald Dahl way possible, complete with word play, dark humour, and crackpot villains.Additionally, there are also some variations on the classic tunes from the 1971 film. For instance, the \"Oompa Loompa\" song makes not one but two appearances here, sung by an Oompa Loompa named Lofty (Hugh Grant). Instead of singing about misbehaving children, Lofty sings about why he is no longer welcome among his peers, which is both sad and funny once you learn the actual reason. The older viewers might appreciate the callbacks to the original \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" film and I'm certain the younger viewers will like the newer songs, but I can't really see any of them getting stuck in people's heads once the movie has finished.As the title character, I liked the youthful spin Timothée Chalamet was able to add to an already exceptionally outlandish individual. His take on Willy Wonka is that of an experienced young man who seems ready to take on the world, only to find that not everyone is there to support him in his endeavours. Chalamet's Wonka seems to be unique among his predecessors in that he does not seem to be the younger version of either one, although he does show some of the condescending traits of Gene Wilder's version and the melancholic insecurities of Johnny Depp's version. This almost seems like a compromise of sorts, as though the filmmakers tried to combine both Wilder's and Depp's Wonkas into one so as not to alienate the fans too much. I would say this does work for the most part, however, I personally think they should have just picked one and gone with that instead.Most of the supporting cast were quite good, especially Wonka's five co-workers turned friends who assist him on his mission. With that in mind, Noodle is clearly the main one out of the five that receives the most attention in the story. Although I did like the idea of her being Wonka's street smart friend, I think there was one important thing about her character that is never explained. Early in the film, we learn that Wonka is illiterate, struggling to comprehend even single letters of the alphabet, which is where Noodle comes in to teach him how to read. Being an orphan who never went to school, how did Noodle become intelligent enough to be able to educate a grown man on the basics of reading and writing? We never find out how she acquired this level of education, so this seems like a major plot hole the movie glosses over. I'm not sure if this is the film's way of saying children are sometimes smarter than adults, but it would have been nice to have been provided some explanation as to how an orphan raised on the streets is capable of teaching an adult man comprehensive English skills.I thought the three main villains were rather amusing at times, but Mr. Slugworth is clearly the leader of the trio. Slugworth is shown to be the brains of this whole operation, which is established by the firm, aggressive handshake he gives to everyone he meets. This film treats him and his two colleagues as though they are running some kind of narcotics ring, only with chocolate instead of drugs. I suppose this would make Slugworth the Gus Fring of chocolatiering, which is made evident by his widespread infamy over the entire town. On that note, I just wish we could have seen more of Mr. Prodnose's and Mr. Fickelgruber's intimidating influence throughout the story. It just seems like all of Matt Lucas's and Mathew Baynton's comedic talents are going to waste here, as their characters serve little purpose other than to agree with everything Slugworth says.Though far from essential viewing, \"Wonka\" still serves its purpose as an enjoyable origin story of the most famous fictional chocolate maker in all of children's literature. It may not instil the same level of wonder as the other two feature films before it, but it provides just enough entertainment for a casual viewing with the whole family. Had the film placed more focus on developing its supporting cast and fixing some plot holes, I would be inclined to give it a wider recommendation. Still, you could definitely do a whole lot worse than what we got so all I can say is just sit back and enjoy it for what it is.I rate it 7/10.",
    "91": "Does chocolate remind you of Christmas? Yes.Does a Dickensian city and poor people immediately take you back to a Christmas setting? Definitely.Do musicals recall you good old times with your acquaIntances? Absolutely.Ladies and gentlemen, that's 'Wonka'! A brilliant movie filled with magic. Chalamet delivers a wonderful performance, whose range of acting hugely widens with this role, from a 1920s clown like Chaplin to a 1950s charming dancer like Gene Kelly.I was especially delighted with the city's atmosphere, it's a Victorian London-like city. It's clear that Paul King knows how to bottle Christmas essence, mixing grayish pedestrian streets and brick buildings with goldish open malls. Watching this movie takes you back to the time when you were a child, and you walked hand in hand with your parents watching extravagant shopwindows displaying the finest products on Christmas.And what about the music? It's perfect! 'Oompah Loompah doompety do' won't get out of your head besides the fancy choreographies, every detail and nuance conveys a Christmas ambience. You can even taste the chocolate, slip with the iced flor covered in snow, smell the chestnuts, notice the smoke from the chimneys...\nFinally, we're not even un mid-December ans \"it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas\" so please get yourself a hot chocolate mug get together with family and enjoy watching 'Wonka' because it will become a Christmas classic.",
    "92": "\"Candy doesn't have to have a point. That's why it's candy.\"\n\"Wonka\" is a two-hour musical comedy directed by Paul King, inspired by Roald Dahl's Wonka books but not strictly following them. The film aims to amuse, delight, and inspire cheers when the bad guys are defeated. The performances, costumes, songs, and choreography are likely better than needed to make it a hit, as it is considered a pre-sold property, as many people know and love Willy Wonka. Wonka and Noodle, two orphans, are sympathetic to Wonka's situation. Wonka carries a chocolate bar created by his mom, a candy-maker, for inspiration. The main bad guys are a trio of powerful businessmen who control candy manufacturing and distribution, keep the city's corrupt police force under their control, and have passed laws making it difficult for anyone else to break into the business. The film features Sally Hawkins as Mama Wonka, who becomes a good luck charm for big-budget fantasies. \"Wonka\" is a captivating and enthusiastic film, with a withholding quality from the character of Wonka, who can be likened to Gene Wilder's long-lost grandchild in moments of quiet contemplation and madcap inspiration. The film's effectiveness makes it a cynical enterprise. Wonka, portrayed by Chalamet, is an innocent and earnest character with a distinctly British sensibility. Unlike Depp's and Wilder's portrayals, Chalamet lacks guile and is guarded in an unnamed European city. The humor is set against a visually dense Technicolor world, with costumes and sets beautifully made. Willy Chalamet's performance in \"Wonka\" is a captivating portrayal of a boyish sweetness with a hint of sadness, expressing his love for chocolate-making. He is portrayed as a wholesome character, resembling P. T. Barnum played by Daniel Day-Lewis' son, Chalamet. Chalamet's heartfelt baritone singing is a testament to his character's wholesome nature. The film's lines, such as \"Put your hand inside your pock-elet, get yourself some Wonka chocolate!\", are a testament to the character's belief in the power of chocolate and its ability to elevate one's mood and life. Chalamet's performance is a testament to the power of chocolate and its ability to change lives. The film overrelies on computer-generated effects and stunts, including a miniaturized performance by Hugh Grant as the Oompa-Loompa Lofty. Despite skepticism, Chalamet gives himself fully to the wonderment and vocal demands of the role. The film is a playful, heart-tugging take on a beloved character that is smarter than it lets on. The film's beautiful costumes and sets make it outstanding to watch. \"Wonka\" is a musical prequel to the Roald Dahl tale, featuring Timothée Chalamet as the title character. Willy, a 25-year-old chocolate lover, arrives in London after seven years of sailing around the globe. He has recipes for his candy, such as hoverchoc, an egg of chocolate with a bug inside that causes levitate. Chalamet's character is characterized by a long purple coat, vest, ascot, and rumpled top hat. Willy's dream is to bring the wonder of his candy to everyone in the world, bringing his passion for chocolate to life.",
    "93": "Years after Gene Wilder brought Willy Wonka to the big screen for the first time and after Johnny Depp played him, now the beloved chocolatier returns to recount his beginnings before creating the chocolate factory. The film tells a charming story that manages to maintain the essence of the 1971 film and update it in an excellent way. He presents us with an innocent and charming Willy Wonka who has that charisma and eccentricity that so characterizes the character. The movie shows Willy as a kind of magician and that's what he's always been since he first appeared in Roald Dahl's book or the original movie. Without a doubt, the actor manages to maintain the eccentricity of the character. Hugh Grant plays the first Oompa-Loompa that Willy met and the way he embodies this peculiar character is wonderful, making him striking. Even though short real actors were used in the original film and CGI was used here, they managed to keep the Oompa-Loompa's appearance and quirkiness intact. The film's musical numbers are a work of art and have the feel of the original film's soundtrack, making the musical scenes masterful. It is quite appreciated that some parts of the original soundtrack were also used. The acting, the production, the special effects, literally everything in this film is excellent, managing to respect the vision of the source of origin and making it a worthy successor to Dahl's work for perfectly capturing its magic. Wonka is definitely one of the best prequels in cinema history and a beautiful film to enjoy with the whole family. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.",
    "94": "Not gunna lie I found this film kind of boring and deluded, stick to the original! The story was not interesting, by making Wonka kind of secret in the original is what made it magical and interesting, Willy Wonka didn't need any back story.The songs weren't as good as they were in the original they seemed plain and unthoughtful.The giraffe milk was odd bd stupid.The cast was ok I guess, a few familiar faces, Roman Atkinson and Matt Lucas, was nice to see them on screen I guess, but apart from that this prequel was nothing special and it definitely wasn't needed.Take my advise avoiddddd.",
    "95": "Wonka is an amazing piece of entertainment reminiscent of old Hollywood when spectacle and awe truly meant something.The secret is that it is a cartoon made in live action. The tone, the musicality, the over-the-top acting and characters, everything has the sweetness and joy of an animated movie.The story is the emotional and musical journey of a very naive but smart character in the true spirit of Roal Dahl. It blends humor, drama and a baroque sense of insanity that wraps you with childlike excitement.Timothée Chalamet nails the complex Wonka by playing it in all seriousness and embracing the silliness like a male Mary Poppins.Paul King uses the 1940s love of dramatic shots, crazy colors and retro choreographies to fill his movie with fascinating set pieces. The shop scene is fabulous and just an example of the incredible attention to details : the right combination of digital and reality. Disney could learn a thing or two from it. Of course if you're familiar with the Paddington movies you will recognize story beats, aesthetic elements and an obsession with heist scenarios but it works for the best. As an incredible rollercoaster of old school fun,\nWonka will melt your heart.",
    "96": "As the worlds number one Willbert Wonkert fan it's a completely unnecessary but on its own solid movie. The directing didn't try to replicate the feeling of either previous Wonka films which is good, it reminded me of the Danny Devito Matilda movie in some places which is funny because Matilda was also created by Roald Dahl. The editing was actually really good, there are a lot of nice touches like sound effects and music syncing to cuts, which is a good segway into the music. The music was quite good, which is good for a musical, there were a couple of songs that I was a little iffy on but it had a lot of energy. The acting was also pretty good, everyone seems to be having a fun time especially the antagonists, but Timothy Chalemet did a decent job. There were a couple times where it felt like he was trying to replicate either one of the previous Wonka actors but when he isn't doing that he's doing a good job, it's definitely not the Wonka I know but it's supposed to be a younger version and I think they did a good job with that. Overall, a pretty good movie, however I feel like as a Roald Dahl enjoyer in the face of the excellent adaptation of certain stories from the book Henry Sugar directed by Wes Anderson also coming out this year, works that I think managed to capture what I loved about Roald Dahls writing and truly elevate it Wonka just doesn't cut it. Especially with the original 1973 movie also elevating the book in my opinion, it is good in terms of being entertaining and being technically good but I don't think it really felt like it either justified its existence, or really provided me what I would want for what is ostensibly an adaptation.",
    "97": "While I cannot say we definitively needed a prequel establishing the foundation of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, I still was looking forward to this film because of Timothee Chalamet, Hugh Grant, and having grown up with and enjoyed Roald Dahl's books. While far from perfect, \"Wonka\" should satisfy families looking for a good time at the movies this holiday season. The film may contain fewer direct tie-ins to Dahl's book than some viewers might expect; however, the whimsy and exaggerated humor of Dahl's writing is very present this story in enthralling and clever ways. The film centers around the conflicts that ensue when Willy Wonka wants to open his own chocolate shop, but realizes that the chocolate industry is heavily monopolized by a \"chocolate cartel\" of corrupt influencers.The film's aesthetics are unique compared to the 1971 Gene Wilder film and the 2005 Johnny Depp film (which also makes sense given the prequel nature,) but they are still very engaging. In particular, the production design of a wintry European city is frequently gorgeous, with excellent cinematography integrated with practical visual effects. Timothee Chalamet is great as Willy Wonka, although his singing during the musical numbers isn't anything exceptional. Yet his charisma fully inhabits the role to make an earnest and endearing character. The supporting characters are mostly underused except for the orphan girl Noodle. Hugh Grant has limited screentime as an Oompah-Loompa, but he does steal the show in every scene he's in. The overarching story of \"Wonka\" is a bit on the formulaic and sentimental side, but Chalamet's acting, enjoyable musical numbers and scrumptious production values make this a sweet and deftly paced treat for both kids and adults. Recommended. 7/10Note: I saw the film in The Big Show, Alamo Drafthouse's premium format screen. The picture and sound quality were very good, particularly during the musical numbers.",
    "98": "'' Wonka '' is a musical taking inspiration of the 1971 version of the book adaption of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, serving as a prequel to the well known story. And trully, King does what King did in Pandington: give a heartwarming, enjoyable fairtale that pleases both adult and younger audiences.First of all, the songs were enjoyable, well performed, with entertaining dancing sequences, and witty lyrics. The costumes and CGI were all great as well, creating the right atmosphere for the story to be properly unfold.As for the story itself, it is pleasant, though, some scenes were a bit too much and a bit cheesy, and the progress of the plot was predictable as well. But the overall result was entertaining and heartwarming.Finally, the performances were great by everyone in the cast.",
    "99": "There's a warm glow to this film. A comfort of joy washes over you as you settle down for this visual treat. It is a borderline musical and it does not take long to establish that musical numbers will come your way.. a lot. They are catchy for sure, but they are unlikely to win any awards. I really did like Timothée Chalamet in this. I thought it was a great casting choice. I'm sure there was a lot of thought went into choosing him and it paid off. I actually preferred his of all the WONKAs gone before. Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp were bordering psychotic weirdos, although I'm probably alone in that thought. Chalamet takes an easier friendlier approach and makes for his friendships in the film much more believable. I don't think the film would have worked otherwise. You know it's a HEYDAY movie now when there is an olde worlde funfair chucked in (and a giraffe) and the cast from past heyday movies (especially from Paddington) make a return for this predominantly British cast. Tom Davis was the chef T-Bone and plays Bleacher in this. I actually laughed out very loudly in the cinema when he puts his lederhosen on! Overall I loved this movie. My hard to please son who is 10, gave it an 8.9 so I'd trust that more than what I'm writing. Overall, lots of fun with a good ending.",
    "100": "As in chocolate and ing ... well something. Anyway, no pun intended. And a musical again - you may say, like I did. Not really something I was looking forward to. And yet the movie got to me ... it really is a feel good movie and it really works. With all the ridiculous and enhancements and caricatures it is drawing. I mean talk about evil ... it relishes in it! The actors turn it up to 11 more than once.But they know what they are doing - they do not have to be reigned in. No sir - although I assume the director had a leash on some of the things ... he had to have, right? Considering all the small details added to the movie I will go ahead and say yes.While I was a bit skeptic, the movie had me quite early. Yes you could make cases about how \"kid friendly\" this is (stunts from the start, as in do not try this at home, riding on top of a car, jumping of it), but it is quite clear that the movie is fantasy. And I think kids can tell too, without wanting to do things they see ... and arent't we all addicted to chocolate already? I'd say the answer is quite ... well revealing ... I mean obvious! Also you get to see one character change physically ... so there is that too.This may be too sweet ... if there is such a thing ... and a pun you would be able to forgive ... now on to watch the 70s movie soon ... never got around to that ... until now, this being a prequel, it should work nicely.",
    "101": "Spectacular production, wonderful casting and a fantastic soundtrack to boot. I was simply blown away by so many amazing original songs and performances, and there was a good balance of comedy and drama that would appeal to the whole family.Having only seen a movie poster of Wonka, I did not have much to go on. I did not even know it was a musical until the movie started, and then, I was engaged from beginning to end.From the playful glint in his eyes to his quirky smiles and cane-twirling sequences, Timothee Chalamet's whimsical performance gives nods to both Johnny Depp's and Gene Wilder's earlier depictions of Wonka, while still adding his own spin and spice (and all things nice) to the young Wonka he plays.There is a purity and crispness in Chalamet's delivery of both script and song that encapsulates that sense of wonder a young Willy Wonka manages to hold on to through the formative years of his youth, despite all the setbacks and hardships that befalls him. And this is key because it carries over into his later years, and it is the re-imagining through this lens of childlike innocence that inspires audiences around the world to have hope and dare to dream again.Special mention to Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa, who delivers his lines in perfect matter-of-fact British fashion. My niece liked his performance so much, she was singing Oompa Loompa all the way home, while I tried to sway her to sing Pure Imagination instead.If there is one movie to catch this Christmas with your loved ones, this should be it! And would I watch it again? Oh, ABSOLUTELY!",
    "102": "Enjoyed this!2023's 'Wonka' is very good! It's an original story based upon the Roald Dahl novel, so it isn't an adaptation as such like the 1971 and 2005 flicks. With that I didn't find it quite as interesting as what's portrayed in the aforementioned films, but I do appreciate (and prefer, tbh) that they went a different way with it here. And it comes out nicely.Timothée Chalamet gives a strong performance in the lead role. Those behind Chalamet are entertaining, from Calah Lane to Keegan-Michael Key to the trio of Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton - the latter three's dance number for the Chief of Police near the beginning is amusing. The musical elements in general are solid.Tom Davis and Olivia Colman are fun too. All characters played by those mentioned above after Lane could've easily have been extremely cringey, but thankfully I didn't find that to be the case for any of them at all - very well written, shown and cast in that regard.Someone I have yet to mention is a certain someone as Lofty, an Oompa-Loompa. Hugh Grant is excellent as the orange-skinned, green-haired fellow, even if they did use Grant's best bits in the trailers; which I usually avoid due to those sort of (albeit minor) spoilers, but evidently failed to do so here.All in all, I'd say this is a success. Credit to them for delivering, especially as I was kinda nonplussed by the already noted trailers (Grant aside).",
    "103": "What is wrong with people nowadays, why all the bad reviews?!This movie is fantastic!The music is excellently crafted and perfectly performed by all.The humour is brilliant, I have never been in a cinema where everyone has laughed out loud, not just children but fully grown adults as well, laughing at a \"children's film\", as I keep seeing in a lot of the reviews on here saying.In my opinion there is no such thing as a children's film but instead films that are appropriate for children to watch but ultimately are for everyone to enjoy.It is my belief that \"grownups\" need to calm down and realise that not every film needs to be a gritty drama, blockbuster saga or a dirty comedy to be considered a great movie for adults to enjoy, let your guard down and just enjoy films like you used to before we all became adults with a singular cynical view of the world why can't we just be happy with lighthearted musical movies, why must we bash them just because its seems to be the way to keep within the in crowd.This movie had me crying with pure joy, with moments of sadness, and with the sheer lyrical talent coupled with the musical brilliance of this movie musical that we haven't seen the likes of in decades!Please ignore the negative reviews and let yourself enjoy this brilliant film uninhabited by what types of films you \"should\" enjoy.",
    "104": "Rating: 5.6\nOverall, a pretty generic, formulaic musical comedy that does not execute well on either front as the writing is very predictable and the musical performances are very bland, with Chalamet's performance feeling more like a Jim Carrey imitation than a young Willy Wonka.Pretty Bad to Decent Direction (The direction on a grand scale was decent as he does a good job in building the magical world, but does not do as good of a job on the musical numbers as they were very cookie cutter and nothing felt spectacular; The direction on a microscale was decent as the interpersonal/dramatic scenes were pretty formulaic to other musicals; similarly, the storytelling felt very similar to other comedy musicals; the direction of actors was pretty good as no performance felt off (though the vocal performances were pretty generic as nobody stood out), Decent Acting (Pretty Bad to Decent from Timothée Chalamet (Does a decent job holding his own as the lead but he is trying way too hard to be a 'Jim Carrey' like character (and it is very obvious in scenes), his singing voice is pretty generic and feels like a typical NYU student), Pretty Good from Calah Lane (Holds her own pretty well and works off of Chalament nicely, does a pretty good job in the musical numbers), Pretty Good from Keegan-Michael Key (Basically just plays a mix of his characters from Key & Peele), Decent to Pretty Good from Paterson Joseph (Does a decent job at playing a musical villain), Decent from Matt Lucas, Decent from Mathew Baynton, Decent from Sally Hawkins (Barely in the movie), Pretty Good from Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean), Decent from Jim Carter, Pretty Good from Tom Davis, Pretty Good to Good from Olivia Colman (The best acting in the movie as you can tell she had to play more from experience with being a villain for the story), Pretty Good from Hugh Grant (Does a good job for what he is called to do, but it just feels like this role is a cash grab for him), Pretty Bad from the rest of the cast (Just generic musical background actors, the singing also was pretty generic as nobody stood out)), Pretty Bad Story (The concept was interesting as Willy Wonka's mysterious backstory was a question in the original story (but this intrigue is not replenished as his origin is pretty predictable and not that interesting); the story construction was fine as follows the comedy musical template; the flow between sequences is not that fluid as there is a musical number almost every 5 minutes (which hurts the plot from moving forward); the character writing is pretty shallow as they don't add anything to Wonka's character and the other characters are pretty cookie-cutter/predictable), Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was incredibly corny and generic for a comedy musical; the humor was very predictable; the symbolism was pretty shallow; the foreshadowing was too overt to where the movie was incredibly predictable (which is mostly because the movie feels templated)), Decent Score/ Bad Soundtrack (Super generic songs that were not that catchy or well performed), Good Cinematography (Helped with displaying how big and magical the world is), Pretty Good Sound, Pretty Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Used well with showing how vast and magical the world is (but the CGI of animals was very noticeable)), Pretty Good Production Design (Helped with creating the world (but most of it felt like CGI/Green Screens)), Pretty Good Makeup, Good to Very Good Costumes (Made Wonka's costume pay homage to Gene Wilder's), Plot Structure was very formulaic as it followed the musical template, Pacing was all over the place as the constant interjection of musical numbers hurt the flow for the movie (especially given it a sub 2-hour movie), Climax was pretty predictable and pretty underwhelming, Tone was very similar to other musical comedies.",
    "105": "I can't put my finger on it, the film just lacked something for me, the music didn't hit the toe tapping quality it maybe could have. The songs over time might enter my most listened tunes for 2024 but interestingly the only time my ears pricked up were when I heard the notes towards the end for pure imagination. The set design and atmosphere were well done but didn't quite hit the magical notes you'd expect for Wonka. Olivia Coleman and Tom Davis were enjoyable but Wonka's sidekicks were sadly mostly forgettable. I enjoyed Keegan's ever increasing waistline over the film's length as he continued to sell himself out but would have liked a bit more menace from the three chocolatiers to offer a bit more jeopardy to the good guys.Hugh Grant was enjoyable and could have been sprinkled in a bit more across the film. Chalamet performed the role admirably, I'm not sure you need to have the qualities of a Gene Kelly to act and sing on film to perform these sorts of roles so he coped well enough with what was required of him.All in all a perfectly good 2 hours revisiting a children's classic and a welcome change from watching a string of below par superhero films.",
    "106": "I've just come home from watching Wonka at the cinema. Bit of an emotional wreck. Such a lovely film.I've always loved the Gene Wilder version since a child. There are so many nods to that version. Timothee Chalamet is a young Gene Wilder. But a softer version. He has the same magic and charm as Gene Wilder.I spent a lot of the movie with tears rolling down my face. Especially when Timothee sings \"Pure Imagination\".There are some amazing scenes. Especially when they are dancing over the rooftops of London.Hugh Grant is just so brilliant and funny as an Oompa Loompa.This film just blew me away.It is utter movie magic.It has everything. A heart warming, tear jerking, show stopping, pure imagination, whale of a ride.",
    "107": "I cannot recommend this movie enough. What you see will defy expectations!It is a worthy prequel to the original. Great characters, great story, great relationships, great music and songs. Funny, heartfelt, and clean.Most modern sequels, prequels, reboots, and spin-offs undermine the original characters , make apologies, and retcon the originals due to changes in society and political correctness\nHere is a film written and produced by people that love and respect the original.Go see it.As far as how Timothy chamalet compares to Gene Wilder...Gene Wilder will forever be, the only Gene Wilder.That being said, Timothy Chamalet knows who he is trying to be, and I think he is acting his heart out trying to be a yonger version of Wilder's Wonka.I was really worried, especially after seeing Dune, that he would be this serious brooding character like Paul Atredis. When he needs to, he does, but he also has a larger than life wonka energy, enthusiasm, spontaneity (could have used just a touch more of spontaneity though).It's almost like seeing Heath Ledger in A Knights Tale or 10 Things I Hate About You, anf then seeing Dark Knight and thinking, wow he can also become THAT character!!",
    "108": "Let's start by saying it's a good movie. Certainly watch it. Actors and storyline are pretty solid and as for young wonka yeah not bad.Issues with the film are two fold. One I think there are too many songs. There was song every 10 mins or so. Simply too many. They were generally ok with some actually good but with so many the good are lost amongst the noise.Secondly and I think this is a director issue really the film lacks that real lasting impact later that comes from moments. It dosnt structure some of the scenes with enough emotion or platform the moment enough to let the very good actors (aside from the little girl who wasn't great, sorry) shine and take the audience to a height which leaves a last mark. Like when Wilder opens the doors to the chocolate room or tells Charlie that he's won from the original. I think that's down to director/producers to create the moment. The actors certainly looked capable.All that said the movie is still good and has a couple of elected moments. Grant is excellent (as he tends to be these days having found a comfort level in just being himself) and the best song in the movie remains imagination and a good rendition of it towards the end of the movie.",
    "109": "This film is way too long.The concept has been done a million times before but better than this. The casting is adequate but none of them can really sing. The girl Noddy or whatever she's called was like a cardboard cutout, she really lacked something to make her part believable or to connect to the audience. Olivia Coleman played Olivia Coleman, she's really good at playing Olivia Coleman.The lead was ok, but that's all I can say. The storytelling was adequate and cinematography too but it's just \"meh\" from start to finish. It was all I could do to stay awake on a miserable UK day.Hugh Grant was washed out with CGI, in this day and age you'd think they'd be able to make things at least appear real.I wasted 40 quid on this rubbish.",
    "110": "I've always liked Timothee Chalamet's performances. Even when he did things exceptionally, it felt like he was really good at that but still not enough for me to love him as an actor. There's a certain charm that I find in actors I grow to love and I found that in him here. Chalamet is brilliant as well as the rest of the cast. I didn't know Olivia Coleman was in this, and even though I recognized her face, I couldn't place her. She looks much younger here as the evil Mrs. Scrubbit and have a completely different body language that I couldn't place her till the credits came on screen, brilliant. Paul King has made this as sweet and optimistic as the Paddington films, even though it does have the darkness of the Wonka world. The movie doesn't dwell on those dark moments, it quickly follows them up with optimism. The songs were great and the older songs used were such fantastic placements. Willy Wonka is yet to be truly betrayed by people and he has the innocence and purity here and that works perfectly. Whatever problems I had must be things that aren't even part of what they meant to tell through this movie. This worked fantastically as a prequel to the 1971 movie.",
    "111": "Just Got out of a Dolby Cinema Screening of WonkaAnother Perfect Watch (For Me)Here's my thoughts on the Film -1. 🎩 Timothy Chalamet as Willy Wonka. I really liked this take, it was a more Delightful Way of Portraying Willy Wonka.2. 📈 The Plotline was Great, I loved it. It was Told in a Very Entertaining Way.3. 📜💬 The Screenplay had a Consistent Interest to it, the at times Snappy Dialogue, the input of Wit here and there and the Cut to Musical Numbers made for a Very Pleasant Watch.4. 🌞 🌚 The Tone. The Fantastical Mood of it all really Elevated the Film Substantially, it was just Constantly Great to Watch. It also has Grounded Emotional Moments Sprinkled in the Film.5. 🙎👩‍⚕️ The Characters.

Loved that Segment.Overall, it was a Perfect Watch and it was also an Entertaining Watch.",
    "112": "I went into this movie having not seen a single preview; I don't watch much cable. I had no expectations or ideas concerning what the movie was about. I figured it would be a remake of the Gene Wilder version I grew up with. Imagine my surprise when I realized it was a Wonka origin story.The story, while not terribly complex, was rich enough to keep attention as was the cinematography. The pacing was solid and 2 hours never felt laborious or drawn out.Where this movie shines was the acting/casting. Tomothèe Chalamet was absolutely perfect in this role as was the rest of the cast. The characters were colorful, endearing, and wildly entertaining. The music was fun, touching, and a few songs had me laughing out loud.I went into this movie to spend time with family. I came out with a smile having just watched a fantastic flick. I hope you make time to share in the magic that is Wonka.",
    "113": "Roald Dahl once wrote that he found Gene Wilder's performance as Wonka in 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory to be a way too \"sappy and saccharine\" version of the character he first envisioned. Well, if that one was \"a bit too much\", Dahl is lucky to have passed away before he could witness the Timothée Chalamet version.Here is a Wonka who is full of cheer and whimsy. Being that it's a prequel, I guess we are to understand that this is set before he adopted more kooky and sinister traits, ergo this isn't quite the Wonka we know. The real issue, perhaps, is the casting. Chalamet can be dark and brooding (Dune), and a little creepy if he needs to (Bones and All), but having him dial up the whimsy feels off.Of course, I also believe that there's a missed opportunity here. A while ago, with regards to FXP's The Bear, I wrote this: \"When Timothée Chalamet was cast for the upcoming Willy Wonka prequel, many TV nerds pointed out that they could've gone with Jeremy Allen White if they wanted someone who has a sort of Chalamet energy to him, but actually LOOKS like a younger Gene Wilder, supposing that's the Wonka they were going for. ... Having watched the show that put White on the map, I see it even more. It's like they had some kind of character customization slider with Wilder on one end and Chalamet on the other and cranked it all the way up to Chalamet when they could've left it in the middle and gotten White.\"Ultimately, however, I warmed up to Chalamet as the picture went along. His singing isn't always great, yet there is an earnestness to it all that seems to have won critics over. Indeed, as if this year in movies wasn't already wild enough, it now closes out with the revelation that, yeah, even the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fan-fic prequel is a part of the \"cinema is back\" club. It's good -- for the most part.Perhaps we were foolish to presume that a Willy Wonka musical as done by the man behind Paddington -- boasting a cast of such names as Sally Hawkins, Rowan Atkinson, and Olivia Colman -- would be mere soulless IP nostalgia bait, especially in the year when Hollywood pictures of that ilk finally would begin to f*ck off. (So starved indeed were people for anything other than the usual slop, with its green-screened everything and persistent key-jangling, that even the return of the Saw franchise, itself more \"on fire\" than before, was cause for more jubilation than, say, most of Disney's output in 2023.) Sure enough, Wonka has more lively and well-staged musical numbers than any of Disney's recent remakes and is unabashedly colorful to look at.I maintain that some aspects looked unpromising as the trailers came out and that the final product is flawed, but this was still a joyous viewing that certainly left me in the mood for some exotic sweets.One still baffling element is the casting of Wonka's first Oompa-Loompa. Instead of a little-person actor, it's Hugh Grant's head on a small body. I understand if little people would find this sort of role demeaning (or if Peter Dinklage's comments about the exploitation of little people made studios less willing to cast little-person performers in roles like this, ironically making the landscape more difficult for the group he sought to protect as they now get even less work), but this isn't really a sight one gets used to.Lastly, allow me to once more evoke David Ehrlich with the following musing: \"There's a delicious irony to the fact that Warner Bros.' first big release since Discovery CEO David Zaslav (once again) canned a completed film in exchange for a $30 million tax write-off is an anti-capitalist fable set in a city run by a ruthless chocolate cartel who've diluted their own product in order to hoard the profits.\" Hollywood will never be perfect, but sometimes, as with the year 2023, it lets out more gold than usual. Golden tickets, if you will? No? Okay.",
    "114": "Today I finally got to watch \"Wonka\" with Timothée Chalamet, and I gotta tell ya, he killed it! He's performance as Willy Wonka was incredible, the acting was good, but Timothée was great! The humor was funny, the characters was funny, and it also has good songs filled with joy from the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.The director Paul King who made Paddington, did a solid job, and the writing and the story was really well written, and it's absolutely magical. It was a pretty good solid prequel, and it has pretty good comedy vibes and some musical styles that will make you dance and also shows you how to make some chocolate.This movie was so great and I say Timothée Chalamet delivers it all with his great acting career, and also cannot wait for his new project in 2024!10/10.",
    "115": "My Review- Wonka\nMy Score 6/10I don't mind sequels and prequels if they achieve something original or unique but I felt that Roald Dahl would have been totally unimpressed with this cliche overload musical confectionery.I'm a lover of musicals and great children's stories but not this movie in fact as much as I enjoyed Timothée Chalamet's characterisation of young Willy Wonker pre his Chocolate factory I was bored .Even though at times some of the musical numbers are spectacular I kept thinking this is just another attempt to make a cash cow out of an iconic character .I kept thinking I've seen this character before they are just borrowing from old musicals like Oliver or Annie .The plot is very different to Roald Dahl's backstory to Willy Wonker who he wrote was the son of his hometown's local dentist, Dr. Wilbur Wonka. This unfortunately made Willy not allowed to eat chocolate and sweets, and he eventually ran away from home, later starting up his chocolate business from a single shop to a gigantic factory.In this Wonker movie Willy is an aspiring magician, inventor and chocolatier who arrives by boat to an unnamed European city to fulfil his dream of opening his chocolate shop at the Galeries Gourmet. He decides to stay at a laundromat after he becomes penniless where he meets the devious Mrs. Scrubbit and her henchman Bleacher who run a sweatshop laundry exploiting their workers.The three other villains are three chocolatiers named Mr. Slugworth, Mr. Prodnose and Mr. Fickelgruber who mock Wonka's chocolates .They scheme together and call the corrupt Chief of Police to confiscate Willy's earnings for the day and continue to thwart his ambitions which if realised would ruin theirs.Wonka is another huge budget movie estimated at $125 million which may or may not succeed I hope it does but it didn't with me and I really wonder what audience demographic this movie is aimed at ?I doubt it would entertain or hold the interest of children under 13 and I also doubt anyone over that age would get much entertainment out of it other than some good performances and a star studded cast.I enjoyed the 2 Paddington movies that Simon Farnaby and Paul King who also is the director of Wonker made but I feel have missed the mark in this movie .To many new characters come flying in and out in all directions but don't seem to add much to the story . Perhaps it just that Roald Dahl had said it all in 1964 in his novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which has already been adapted as a stage musical book by David Greig, music by Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Mark Shaiman and Scott Wittman.Joby Talbot the composer of Wonka has written a few good songs for the movie but nothing that I'd say would be remembered certainly no where near quality of the Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley score for Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory which produced The Candy Man and Pure Imagination which is also used in the finale of Wonker.The ensemble cast is impressive and full of big names like Olivia Colman as Mrs Scrubbit , Matt Lucas as Prodnose , Hugh Grant as Oopa Loompa Guard 1, Sally Hawkins as Willy\nWonka's mum ,Rowan Atkinson as Father Julius and Jim Carter as Abscus Crunch.They are all fun to watch for a while but I found the overall experience of Wonka irritating.Unlike the superb 2018 sequel to Mary Poppins Mary Poppins Returns Wonka for me added nothing to the wonderful Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory movie of 1971 starring Gene Wilder .However I will say top marks to Timothée Chalamet who impresses me more and more in his movie career. He is worth seeing in this movie as he sings and dances giving an elfish charm to his character in what for me is a lacklustre movie.This chocoholic got saccharine overload in a movie with to many bright wrappers and to many soft centres.",
    "116": "The book was a part of my childhood and I absolutely adored the film, watching whenever it was on TV... so it was very excited when I heard this was being made.I personally think Timothée Chalamet is a brilliant actor so my expectations were high and then my friend mentioned it was a musical and honestly my heart sank. The original works because it's old and of that time and as a child you feel differently about musicals. Now, I just find them a bit annoying and most have songs for songs sake. So as the first song started, I was more than ready to roll my eyes .... but it didn't happen. The songs were sweet, in-keeping with the story and they didn't feel over the top.Timothée absolutely shone as a yong Willy Wonka with his hat full of magic and hhis heart full of hopes and dreams. I felt his characterisation was perfect, confident but his belief in his craft spoke for itself... in the reaction from those tasting them. I honestly wanted to eat those Hoverchocs myself - A cherry and salted caramel marshmallow chocolate containing a microscopic hover-fly, the descriptions reminded me of the Roald Dahl book.I thought all the supporting actors were brilliant but I particularly loved Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa, a character I immediately connected to and it felt nostalgic to understand how Wonka first became acquainted with them.It's got everything you'd want from a feel good movie from a little injustice, the wonderfully awful villains, the hero and the help. I think this is going to be a huge success and a film I know I'll watch again and again.",
    "117": "Wonka joins a long line of IP that is being squeezed by the film industry as they try to eek out every last penny from recognisable names and brands. But does that mean that this film is just a lazy cash grab? Thankfully no.There is a magically charming quality to this film that warms the heart and puts a smile on the face. It is full of whimsy humour, over exaggerated characters and delightfully lyrical dialogue that all create a fun and engaging world to dive into. You can tell that care has been put into this film.It has a nice and breezy plot with some good character moments and decent momentum, even if it is a little overly sweet at times. I do also think it plays much more to its younger audience than its older one, and could have pushed some of the jokes and dialogue a little more to redress this balance. Overall the story is not particularly showstopping but it does the job.The cast is a veritable who's who of British comedy actors with some great bigger name cameos in there too. I do think the performances are a mixed bag but there are some great ones in here. Then there's the performance from Timothee Chalamet as Wonka, which I wasn't always convinced by. At times I loved it, but at others it feels a little cheesy (and not in the intentionally cheesy way that some of the other performances are).As a musical I was never truly convinced by any of the songs or any of the vocals. I'm writing this review shortly after watching the film and there are no melodies bouncing around my head that I can't shake. Usually after watching a musical I find at least one song to add to my playlist, but that isn't the case here.Ultimately I did like this film and it is a good time, but I think the brilliant tone and vibe cover up some of it's mediocrity. It has a good plot and a good lead performance, but there isn't much about this film that is amazing.",
    "118": "A prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an enticing idea, especially if the film is a prequel to either the 1971 or 2005 film. It should not be a difficult endeavour provided there is consistency to one film or the other. The problem I found with this film is that the setting has the Germanic vibe of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory but Timothee Chalamet is channeling Johnny Depp from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Apart from the Johnny Depp's Wonka impersonation, there is nothing in this film that is related to that 2005 film. The backstory of the dentist father and the origins of the oompa loompa are dropped for something different. Shame. I would have liked it if this film was set in that universe. To add to the disappointment we did not get a story that is set in the 1971 universe either as the character of Slugworth and the people are completely different as well. Put it this way it is a film very much for 2023. I mean if you are going to do a prequel, at least try and be consistent with that 1971 universe.There are some positives. I found Timothee Chalamet charming and a great fit for the role. Some of the jokes landed, but not enough to warrant a comedy (in the full house I saw it in, no one laughed out once). Paterson Joseph was fantastic as the villainous Slugworth. It was also great to see Tom Davis get more screen time (a very underrated actor). Hugh Grant was probably the best bit of the film and it is a shame we did not get more of him. The dancing was also fun to watch.Unfortunately, for me, most of the songs did not land. The story was also lame and the character of this young Wonka did not gel with the craggy, somewhat mean, reclusive character we know when his chocolate ideas get stolen. To be honest I was somewhat bored by it. I checked the time twice as I felt it was 20 minutes too long.It is not a film I would see twice after loving the first two movies. I came away disappointed as it was not the prequel I had hoped to see.",
    "119": "I love chocolate! And it would seem that the consumption of nearly 7.5 million metric tonnes of it around the world last year indicates there's a lot of people out there who do too! And who among us hasn't enjoyed the past movies about Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory? But how did Willy Wonka get to be such a famous character? Director Paul King has the answer in the new Wonka movie.The performances, costumes, songs, and choreography are all better than they needed to be to make this movie sure to be a hit. Timothé Chalamet, who portrays Willy Wonka, gives the character a youthful charm and eccentric edge that feels new and nuanced.The world of Wonka is whimsical and filled with vibrant colours, and the candy creations are delightfully yummy! The original songs are catchy and heartwarming. The well-composed songs are seamlessly integrated into the story and add a beautiful touch of magic and emotional depth. Despite my usual distaste for musicals, I found myself tapping my foot along on multiple occasions. Wonka celebrates the power of our imaginations and encourages us to embrace our own unique dreams.Considering how entertaining Wonka was for the most part, I feel bad about having to criticise it. I'll have to indulge in the guilty pleasure of chocolate consumption to compensate 😉. Just three things I'll mention:Firstly, the story feels a bit rushed sometimes, particularly in the second half of the movie, which leaves some of the character arcs underdeveloped. Second, if you are familiar with Roald Dahl's world or have watched the original film, you might recognise some of the story's fundamental plot points. And, finally, while Wonka shines, some of the supporting characters, like the young Oompa-Loompas, could have had their personalities fleshed out.Leaving those few flaws behind, it is important to mention that Wonka tackles some serious issues! It reminds us that 'the greedy beat the needy every time.' It touches on the themes of resilience and resourcefulness-traits we definitely need to develop nowadays. And most importantly, does candy have a point?Wonka is beautiful and moving, and it shows how important it is to be creative and follow one's dreams. And it justifies the necessity of chocolate! Despite its flaws (a predictable plot and underdeveloped supporting characters), Wonka is a fun film with a fantastic performance from Timothée Charlamet and is sure to be a hit with families with children older than eight. Lots of grownups, though, will be curious to see it as well!",
    "120": "1hour and 56 minutes of pure brilliance.We smiled, we laughed, we cried. It will take you to a world of pure imagination and keep you there the entire time.It will end up being a classic and one not to miss. I couldn't name one thing I didn't like so this was a 10 for me.Think 'The Greatest Showman' meets 'Willy Wonka'.It's been a long time since I've left the movie theatre feeling the way Wonka made me feel.Being 35 means I had a childhood watching classics, one of them being Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I must prepare you. The end of this new 'Wonka' will take you right back to those same feelings you got watching the original for the first time. Prepare yourself to well up.Those first musical notes of 'Pure imagination' is transformative.Wonderful. Just wonderful.",
    "121": "I hardly ever used this word to describe movies but Wonka is absolutely delightful in almost every way. Honestly if someone watched it and told me they weren't at least charmed by it I might question their sanity. Sometimes it's just nice to have a film about good people doing good things with a really wholesome message and outlook on life and Wonka delivers all of that and then some.Timothée Chalamet is amazing in this movie, very few actors could emulate that overly whimsy style of humour that Gene Wilder perfected and he does it so perfectly. The way he plays this character is so unbelievably endearing with just the right amount of sentimentality and it never made me cringe once, quite the opposite in fact. He's just the head of a whole cast full of unbelievably likeable characters that ensure that this entire film is chock full of satisfying moments some of which even brought a tear to my eye as cheesy as it might sound.It really should come as no surprise how well produced this film is on a technical and script level considering the fact that it's the same man who brought about both the Paddington films. It's gorgeously shot, especially from a cinematography perspective, and I loved all of the musical sequences all of which I'm still playing in my head right now. It's laugh out loud funny with a lot more well rounded character moments than I ever would've expected. This clearly was not a pay check job for anyone involved and this is the kind of craft I would love to see more of in blockbuster movies.If I had to knock the film for a few things it would be that a lot of the stuff away from the Wonka character wasn't nearly as entertaining. All the villainous characters were over-the-top in all the right ways but they did start to wear out their welcome for me after a while. Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa is such a great concept and he is fantastic but he wasn't in the movie as much as I would've liked because he and Chalamet made such a great pair. I also think the film was starting to feel a little long by the time the 3rd act came around but I was having such a good time watching it that it didn't bother me too much.Wonka was far better than it had any right to be and I could absolutely see myself rewatching many more times. Chalamet is basically perfect and this role just goes to show how much range he has as an actor. I would fight back against anyone who thinks this is a corporate cash grab because the feeling it gave me is one very few other movies have given me all year. I think the best compliment I could give Wonka is that it's absolutely a movie I would show my kids one day.",
    "122": "Wonka's story in this film is very weakly based on the book, but they made something new, something we can call a prequel, but not exactly. It's a story on its own. The story that tells us the beginnings of Willy Wonka, and how he and his chocolate became famous. First of all, I was a little skeptical about this. I thought that the new actor for Willy would be dumb and badly played, but I got the exact opposite of it. Wonka performed by Timothée Chalamet played absolutely amazing, he did have this magic that somehow Johnny Depp didn't have. He was the actor that fitted the character surprisingly best, from what I have seen so far. Timothée did sing very good, too, and he sang the songs greatly with a nice voice, as well as the rest of the cast. The story was gripping and extremely well developed. Wonka's flashbacks with his mother (Not father this time) was a well addition to the story and his character development came brighter in, and he was more understandable then, too. Wonka as a character was good introduced, but I think his backstory came much later, and could come more on the beginning, but that's ok. Wonka's friend, Noodle, was a good addition to the story, and she as his friend was something amazing. Wonka's connection with Noodle was organic and didn't felt fake at all. The action and build-up was in a way that I could see it was a Paul King film. He directed the two Paddington movies, and he has a similar style of humor and way of building up action. The moral was good, good value and something everyone can get out from the story. But the scenography was the absolutely best thing about the film. The strong, powerful colors from the candy and chocolate, and the amazing decorations and exteriors in the town they lived in. Nice visuals, as well as the costumes for the actors and actress. Hugh Grant as the Umpa-Lumpa had a fantastic costume, and he was characterized great with good make-up and had the perfect size for the creature. The songs were composed fine, sometimes could the text have a better rhythm to the melody, but that was rare, maybe two or three times it happened. In the end, Wonka was a great experience, a perfect film for the whole family, I really liked the first film, but this one is just more magical and made in a different way, that I really enjoyed. Recommending!",
    "123": "Just got back from this on its opening release date with my Mom! I absolutely ADORED it!!!The story: Willy Wonka, a magician/inventor/chocolatier arrives in an old English city with a happy hopeful dream: selling chocolate and spreading magic and happiness to all of the townsfolk! However, three other pride and greed infested chocolatiers, Ficklegruber, Prodnose, and Slugworth (collectively knows as The Chocolate Cartel) are instantly consumed with jealousy and annoyance at Wonka's work, and decide to try and crush his dreams. Luckily, with a group of wishy-washy washers from a hard labored laundry business, Wonka might have just the friends he needs to succeed, and make his Mama proud!The cast was an excellent, interesting choice of actors; each actor had the perfect mood to fit their character in different situations in the film. I enjoyed Timothee Chalamet, Hugh Grant, and Olivia Colman's performances the best; they really made me laugh!The film had a nice lighthearted, cheery, and humorous tone to it. A little something for adults, and children. I felt constant giddiness throughout the film! Sets and effects were pretty neat as well. The musical numbers, were outstanding! For each situation in the film, there was an excellent song to go with it! My favorite songs were \"You've never had a Chocolate like This\", and \"A World of your Own\". Plus, as respect payment for the 1971 version, the Oompa-Loompa song, and \"Pure Imagination\" were also featured, with brand new clever lyrics!Overall, this was one of the most happy, funny, exciting, descriptive, detailed, and clever musicals I've ever seen!! I've never felt such giddiness, joy, cheerfulness, and happiness at the movie theater before!! I actually felt like I was a kid again, skipping down the theater steps with my Mom, still singing \"A World of your Own\". I truly cherished Wonka! DON'T miss it!! And if you get the chance, take the kids along too! You'll all have a scrumdidilyumptiously delicious time!!",
    "124": "WONKA is a huge surprise and a fun time at the movies. I didn't really expect much going in, besides King's attachment as director, but was surprised at how well-made this film is. It blends movie magic, well choreographed musical numbers, and a heartwarming story to make the perfect family film. Although I would've preferred a bit more moral and meaning to the story, Wonka delivers a feel-good experience and I enjoyed it a lot. It is just what it needs to be and subverts expectations. When I first heard about Chalamet's casting as the title character, I thought it wouldn't work, coming off of Dune (2021), but I was wrong. His charisma and joyous presence on screen made me realize his capability as an actor. All of the cast members were really good, but the main star of the film is director Paul King. He previously directed Paddington 1 and 2, two films my family and I really enjoyed, and was my only source of optimism for this film. He really knocked it out of the park with the way he handled the story and reassured my faith in him as a filmmaker. The way he handled the musical elements of the film were especially well done. Overall, this is one of the better films I've seen this year and deserves more attention.",

But after waiting for this movie to end for two full hours in the cinema i felt obliged to warn other people.1) The songs are so generic. Like if someone\ntried to write a musical in 20 minutes.2) The movie is neither funny, exciting, suspenseful or beautiful. Just boring.3) The acting is ok. But that's it. Timothee chalamet did not convince me here. It felt like he was not fit for the role.4) I liked the costumes and the whole look of the film. But on the other hand it was rather generic too. Almost too colorful.I hope this helps.",
    "126": "Just Got out of a Dolby Cinema Screening of WonkaAnother Perfect Watch (For Me)Here's my thoughts on the Film -1. 🎩 Timothy Chalamet as Willy Wonka.

    "127": "I went into this movie having not seen a single preview; I don't watch much cable. I had no expectations or ideas concerning what the movie was about. I figured it would be a remake of the Gene Wilder version I grew up with. Imagine my surprise when I realized it was a Wonka origin story.The story, while not terribly complex, was rich enough to keep attention as was the cinematography. The pacing was solid and 2 hours never felt laborious or drawn out.Where this movie shines was the acting/casting. Tomothèe Chalamet was absolutely perfect in this role as was the rest of the cast. The characters were colorful, endearing, and wildly entertaining. The music was fun, touching, and a few songs had me laughing out loud.I went into this movie to spend time with family. I came out with a smile having just watched a fantastic flick. I hope you make time to share in the magic that is Wonka.",
    "128": "Roald Dahl once wrote that he found Gene Wilder's performance as Wonka in 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory to be a way too \"sappy and saccharine\" version of the character he first envisioned. Well, if that one was \"a bit too much\", Dahl is lucky to have passed away before he could witness the Timothée Chalamet version.Here is a Wonka who is full of cheer and whimsy. Being that it's a prequel, I guess we are to understand that this is set before he adopted more kooky and sinister traits, ergo this isn't quite the Wonka we know. The real issue, perhaps, is the casting. Chalamet can be dark and brooding (Dune), and a little creepy if he needs to (Bones and All), but having him dial up the whimsy feels off.Of course, I also believe that there's a missed opportunity here. A while ago, with regards to FXP's The Bear, I wrote this: \"When Timothée Chalamet was cast for the upcoming Willy Wonka prequel, many TV nerds pointed out that they could've gone with Jeremy Allen White if they wanted someone who has a sort of Chalamet energy to him, but actually LOOKS like a younger Gene Wilder, supposing that's the Wonka they were going for. ... Having watched the show that put White on the map, I see it even more. It's like they had some kind of character customization slider with Wilder on one end and Chalamet on the other and cranked it all the way up to Chalamet when they could've left it in the middle and gotten White.\"Ultimately, however, I warmed up to Chalamet as the picture went along. His singing isn't always great, yet there is an earnestness to it all that seems to have won critics over. Indeed, as if this year in movies wasn't already wild enough, it now closes out with the revelation that, yeah, even the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fan-fic prequel is a part of the \"cinema is back\" club. It's good -- for the most part.Perhaps we were foolish to presume that a Willy Wonka musical as done by the man behind Paddington -- boasting a cast of such names as Sally Hawkins, Rowan Atkinson, and Olivia Colman -- would be mere soulless IP nostalgia bait, especially in the year when Hollywood pictures of that ilk finally would begin to f*ck off. (So starved indeed were people for anything other than the usual slop, with its green-screened everything and persistent key-jangling, that even the return of the Saw franchise, itself more \"on fire\" than before, was cause for more jubilation than, say, most of Disney's output in 2023.) Sure enough, Wonka has more lively and well-staged musical numbers than any of Disney's recent remakes and is unabashedly colorful to look at.I maintain that some aspects looked unpromising as the trailers came out and that the final product is flawed, but this was still a joyous viewing that certainly left me in the mood for some exotic sweets.One still baffling element is the casting of Wonka's first Oompa-Loompa. Instead of a little-person actor, it's Hugh Grant's head on a small body. I understand if little people would find this sort of role demeaning (or if Peter Dinklage's comments about the exploitation of little people made studios less willing to cast little-person performers in roles like this, ironically making the landscape more difficult for the group he sought to protect as they now get even less work), but this isn't really a sight one gets used to.Lastly, allow me to once more evoke David Ehrlich with the following musing: \"There's a delicious irony to the fact that Warner Bros.' first big release since Discovery CEO David Zaslav (once again) canned a completed film in exchange for a $30 million tax write-off is an anti-capitalist fable set in a city run by a ruthless chocolate cartel who've diluted their own product in order to hoard the profits.\" Hollywood will never be perfect, but sometimes, as with the year 2023, it lets out more gold than usual. Golden tickets, if you will? No? Okay.",
    "129": "Today I finally got to watch \"Wonka\" with Timothée Chalamet, and I gotta tell ya, he killed it! He's performance as Willy Wonka was incredible, the acting was good, but Timothée was great! The humor was funny, the characters was funny, and it also has good songs filled with joy from the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.The director Paul King who made Paddington, did a solid job, and the writing and the story was really well written, and it's absolutely magical. It was a pretty good solid prequel, and it has pretty good comedy vibes and some musical styles that will make you dance and also shows you how to make some chocolate.This movie was so great and I say Timothée Chalamet delivers it all with his great acting career, and also cannot wait for his new project in 2024!10/10.",
    "130": "My Review- Wonka\nMy Score 6/10I don't mind sequels and prequels if they achieve something original or unique but I felt that Roald Dahl would have been totally unimpressed with this cliche overload musical confectionery.I'm a lover of musicals and great children's stories but not this movie in fact as much as I enjoyed Timothée Chalamet's characterisation of young Willy Wonker pre his Chocolate factory I was bored .Even though at times some of the musical numbers are spectacular I kept thinking this is just another attempt to make a cash cow out of an iconic character .I kept thinking I've seen this character before they are just borrowing from old musicals like Oliver or Annie .The plot is very different to Roald Dahl's backstory to Willy Wonker who he wrote was the son of his hometown's local dentist, Dr. Wilbur Wonka. This unfortunately made Willy not allowed to eat chocolate and sweets, and he eventually ran away from home, later starting up his chocolate business from a single shop to a gigantic factory.In this Wonker movie Willy is an aspiring magician, inventor and chocolatier who arrives by boat to an unnamed European city to fulfil his dream of opening his chocolate shop at the Galeries Gourmet. He decides to stay at a laundromat after he becomes penniless where he meets the devious Mrs. Scrubbit and her henchman Bleacher who run a sweatshop laundry exploiting their workers.The three other villains are three chocolatiers named Mr. Slugworth, Mr. Prodnose and Mr. Fickelgruber who mock Wonka's chocolates .They scheme together and call the corrupt Chief of Police to confiscate Willy's earnings for the day and continue to thwart his ambitions which if realised would ruin theirs.Wonka is another huge budget movie estimated at $125 million which may or may not succeed I hope it does but it didn't with me and I really wonder what audience demographic this movie is aimed at ?I doubt it would entertain or hold the interest of children under 13 and I also doubt anyone over that age would get much entertainment out of it other than some good performances and a star studded cast.I enjoyed the 2 Paddington movies that Simon Farnaby and Paul King who also is the director of Wonker made but I feel have missed the mark in this movie .To many new characters come flying in and out in all directions but don't seem to add much to the story . Perhaps it just that Roald Dahl had said it all in 1964 in his novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which has already been adapted as a stage musical book by David Greig, music by Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Mark Shaiman and Scott Wittman.Joby Talbot the composer of Wonka has written a few good songs for the movie but nothing that I'd say would be remembered certainly no where near quality of the Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley score for Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory which produced The Candy Man and Pure Imagination which is also used in the finale of Wonker.The ensemble cast is impressive and full of big names like Olivia Colman as Mrs Scrubbit , Matt Lucas as Prodnose , Hugh Grant as Oopa Loompa Guard 1, Sally Hawkins as Willy\nWonka's mum ,Rowan Atkinson as Father Julius and Jim Carter as Abscus Crunch.They are all fun to watch for a while but I found the overall experience of Wonka irritating.Unlike the superb 2018 sequel to Mary Poppins Mary Poppins Returns Wonka for me added nothing to the wonderful Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory movie of 1971 starring Gene Wilder .However I will say top marks to Timothée Chalamet who impresses me more and more in his movie career. He is worth seeing in this movie as he sings and dances giving an elfish charm to his character in what for me is a lacklustre movie.This chocoholic got saccharine overload in a movie with to many bright wrappers and to many soft centres.",
    "131": "The book was a part of my childhood and I absolutely adored the film, watching whenever it was on TV... so it was very excited when I heard this was being made.I personally think Timothée Chalamet is a brilliant actor so my expectations were high and then my friend mentioned it was a musical and honestly my heart sank. The original works because it's old and of that time and as a child you feel differently about musicals. Now, I just find them a bit annoying and most have songs for songs sake. So as the first song started, I was more than ready to roll my eyes .... but it didn't happen. The songs were sweet, in-keeping with the story and they didn't feel over the top.Timothée absolutely shone as a yong Willy Wonka with his hat full of magic and hhis heart full of hopes and dreams. I felt his characterisation was perfect, confident but his belief in his craft spoke for itself... in the reaction from those tasting them. I honestly wanted to eat those Hoverchocs myself - A cherry and salted caramel marshmallow chocolate containing a microscopic hover-fly, the descriptions reminded me of the Roald Dahl book.I thought all the supporting actors were brilliant but I particularly loved Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa, a character I immediately connected to and it felt nostalgic to understand how Wonka first became acquainted with them.It's got everything you'd want from a feel good movie from a little injustice, the wonderfully awful villains, the hero and the help. I think this is going to be a huge success and a film I know I'll watch again and again.",
    "132": "Wonka joins a long line of IP that is being squeezed by the film industry as they try to eek out every last penny from recognisable names and brands. But does that mean that this film is just a lazy cash grab? Thankfully no.There is a magically charming quality to this film that warms the heart and puts a smile on the face. It is full of whimsy humour, over exaggerated characters and delightfully lyrical dialogue that all create a fun and engaging world to dive into. You can tell that care has been put into this film.It has a nice and breezy plot with some good character moments and decent momentum, even if it is a little overly sweet at times. I do also think it plays much more to its younger audience than its older one, and could have pushed some of the jokes and dialogue a little more to redress this balance. Overall the story is not particularly showstopping but it does the job.The cast is a veritable who's who of British comedy actors with some great bigger name cameos in there too. I do think the performances are a mixed bag but there are some great ones in here. Then there's the performance from Timothee Chalamet as Wonka, which I wasn't always convinced by. At times I loved it, but at others it feels a little cheesy (and not in the intentionally cheesy way that some of the other performances are).As a musical I was never truly convinced by any of the songs or any of the vocals. I'm writing this review shortly after watching the film and there are no melodies bouncing around my head that I can't shake. Usually after watching a musical I find at least one song to add to my playlist, but that isn't the case here.Ultimately I did like this film and it is a good time, but I think the brilliant tone and vibe cover up some of it's mediocrity. It has a good plot and a good lead performance, but there isn't much about this film that is amazing.",
    "133": "A prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an enticing idea, especially if the film is a prequel to either the 1971 or 2005 film. It should not be a difficult endeavour provided there is consistency to one film or the other. The problem I found with this film is that the setting has the Germanic vibe of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory but Timothee Chalamet is channeling Johnny Depp from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Apart from the Johnny Depp's Wonka impersonation, there is nothing in this film that is related to that 2005 film. The backstory of the dentist father and the origins of the oompa loompa are dropped for something different. Shame. I would have liked it if this film was set in that universe. To add to the disappointment we did not get a story that is set in the 1971 universe either as the character of Slugworth and the people are completely different as well. Put it this way it is a film very much for 2023. I mean if you are going to do a prequel, at least try and be consistent with that 1971 universe.There are some positives. I found Timothee Chalamet charming and a great fit for the role. Some of the jokes landed, but not enough to warrant a comedy (in the full house I saw it in, no one laughed out once). Paterson Joseph was fantastic as the villainous Slugworth. It was also great to see Tom Davis get more screen time (a very underrated actor). Hugh Grant was probably the best bit of the film and it is a shame we did not get more of him. The dancing was also fun to watch.Unfortunately, for me, most of the songs did not land. The story was also lame and the character of this young Wonka did not gel with the craggy, somewhat mean, reclusive character we know when his chocolate ideas get stolen. To be honest I was somewhat bored by it. I checked the time twice as I felt it was 20 minutes too long.It is not a film I would see twice after loving the first two movies. I came away disappointed as it was not the prequel I had hoped to see.",
    "134": "I love chocolate! And it would seem that the consumption of nearly 7.5 million metric tonnes of it around the world last year indicates there's a lot of people out there who do too! And who among us hasn't enjoyed the past movies about Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory? But how did Willy Wonka get to be such a famous character? Director Paul King has the answer in the new Wonka movie.The performances, costumes, songs, and choreography are all better than they needed to be to make this movie sure to be a hit. Timothé Chalamet, who portrays Willy Wonka, gives the character a youthful charm and eccentric edge that feels new and nuanced.The world of Wonka is whimsical and filled with vibrant colours, and the candy creations are delightfully yummy! The original songs are catchy and heartwarming. The well-composed songs are seamlessly integrated into the story and add a beautiful touch of magic and emotional depth. Despite my usual distaste for musicals, I found myself tapping my foot along on multiple occasions. Wonka celebrates the power of our imaginations and encourages us to embrace our own unique dreams.Considering how entertaining Wonka was for the most part, I feel bad about having to criticise it. I'll have to indulge in the guilty pleasure of chocolate consumption to compensate 😉. Just three things I'll mention:Firstly, the story feels a bit rushed sometimes, particularly in the second half of the movie, which leaves some of the character arcs underdeveloped. Second, if you are familiar with Roald Dahl's world or have watched the original film, you might recognise some of the story's fundamental plot points. And, finally, while Wonka shines, some of the supporting characters, like the young Oompa-Loompas, could have had their personalities fleshed out.Leaving those few flaws behind, it is important to mention that Wonka tackles some serious issues! It reminds us that 'the greedy beat the needy every time.' It touches on the themes of resilience and resourcefulness-traits we definitely need to develop nowadays. And most importantly, does candy have a point?Wonka is beautiful and moving, and it shows how important it is to be creative and follow one's dreams. And it justifies the necessity of chocolate! Despite its flaws (a predictable plot and underdeveloped supporting characters), Wonka is a fun film with a fantastic performance from Timothée Charlamet and is sure to be a hit with families with children older than eight. Lots of grownups, though, will be curious to see it as well!",
    "135": "1hour and 56 minutes of pure brilliance.We smiled, we laughed, we cried. It will take you to a world of pure imagination and keep you there the entire time.It will end up being a classic and one not to miss. I couldn't name one thing I didn't like so this was a 10 for me.Think 'The Greatest Showman' meets 'Willy Wonka'.It's been a long time since I've left the movie theatre feeling the way Wonka made me feel.Being 35 means I had a childhood watching classics, one of them being Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I must prepare you. The end of this new 'Wonka' will take you right back to those same feelings you got watching the original for the first time. Prepare yourself to well up.Those first musical notes of 'Pure imagination' is transformative.Wonderful. Just wonderful.",
    "136": "I hardly ever used this word to describe movies but Wonka is absolutely delightful in almost every way. Honestly if someone watched it and told me they weren't at least charmed by it I might question their sanity. Sometimes it's just nice to have a film about good people doing good things with a really wholesome message and outlook on life and Wonka delivers all of that and then some.Timothée Chalamet is amazing in this movie, very few actors could emulate that overly whimsy style of humour that Gene Wilder perfected and he does it so perfectly. The way he plays this character is so unbelievably endearing with just the right amount of sentimentality and it never made me cringe once, quite the opposite in fact. He's just the head of a whole cast full of unbelievably likeable characters that ensure that this entire film is chock full of satisfying moments some of which even brought a tear to my eye as cheesy as it might sound.It really should come as no surprise how well produced this film is on a technical and script level considering the fact that it's the same man who brought about both the Paddington films. It's gorgeously shot, especially from a cinematography perspective, and I loved all of the musical sequences all of which I'm still playing in my head right now. It's laugh out loud funny with a lot more well rounded character moments than I ever would've expected. This clearly was not a pay check job for anyone involved and this is the kind of craft I would love to see more of in blockbuster movies.If I had to knock the film for a few things it would be that a lot of the stuff away from the Wonka character wasn't nearly as entertaining. All the villainous characters were over-the-top in all the right ways but they did start to wear out their welcome for me after a while. Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa is such a great concept and he is fantastic but he wasn't in the movie as much as I would've liked because he and Chalamet made such a great pair. I also think the film was starting to feel a little long by the time the 3rd act came around but I was having such a good time watching it that it didn't bother me too much.Wonka was far better than it had any right to be and I could absolutely see myself rewatching many more times. Chalamet is basically perfect and this role just goes to show how much range he has as an actor. I would fight back against anyone who thinks this is a corporate cash grab because the feeling it gave me is one very few other movies have given me all year. I think the best compliment I could give Wonka is that it's absolutely a movie I would show my kids one day.",
    "137": "Wonka's story in this film is very weakly based on the book, but they made something new, something we can call a prequel, but not exactly. It's a story on its own. The story that tells us the beginnings of Willy Wonka, and how he and his chocolate became famous. First of all, I was a little skeptical about this. I thought that the new actor for Willy would be dumb and badly played, but I got the exact opposite of it. Wonka performed by Timothée Chalamet played absolutely amazing, he did have this magic that somehow Johnny Depp didn't have. He was the actor that fitted the character surprisingly best, from what I have seen so far. Timothée did sing very good, too, and he sang the songs greatly with a nice voice, as well as the rest of the cast. The story was gripping and extremely well developed.

The action and build-up was in a way that I could see it was a Paul King film. He directed the two Paddington movies, and he has a similar style of humor and way of building up action.

The strong, powerful colors from the candy and chocolate, and the amazing decorations and exteriors in the town they lived in. Nice visuals, as well as the costumes for the actors and actress. Hugh Grant as the Umpa-Lumpa had a fantastic costume, and he was characterized great with good make-up and had the perfect size for the creature. The songs were composed fine, sometimes could the text have a better rhythm to the melody, but that was rare, maybe two or three times it happened. In the end, Wonka was a great experience, a perfect film for the whole family, I really liked the first film, but this one is just more magical and made in a different way, that I really enjoyed.

    "141": "Wonka tells the origin story of Willy Wonka(Timothee Chalamet), the iconic chocolatier from Roald Dahl's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Despite being broke, a young Willy Wonka aspires to open the best chocolate shop in the world. However, he finds out that the chocolate industry is run by a cabal of chocolatiers, who are drunk with power.Wonka is an excellent film. Director Paul King has given us a movie that is hilarious, endearing, has a few catchy songs & above all, is super entertaining. The set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are perfect. Watching all of Willy Wonka's magical & delicious chocolates come to life on the big screen, is an absolute joy to watch. Timothee Chalamet is spectacular as Willy Wonka. Chalamet gives us another unforgettable performance, this time in a light-hearted role, that shows his incredible versatility. Calah Lane is outstanding as Noodle. Olivia Colman & Tom Davis are awe-inspiring as Mrs. Scrubbit & Bleacher, respectively. Keegan Michael-Key is hysterical as the Chief of Police. Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas & Mathew Baynton are perfect as Slugworth, Prodnose & Fickelgruber, respectively. Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, Jim Carter, Rakhee Thakrar, Natasha Rothwell, Rich Fulcher, Colin O'Brien & Sally Hawkins are perfect as the Oompa-Loompa, Father Julius, Abacus Crunch, Lottie Bell, Piper Benz, Larry Chucklesworth, Young Willy Wonka & Willy's Mother, respectively. Wonka is a must watch for chocolate lovers & fans of Roald Dahl's source material & its two previous big screen adaptations. Watch it & have a whale of a time, with a guaranteed craving for chocolate, once the credits roll!",
    "142": "When he first emerged as a budding star, Timothee Chalamet struck me as an actor with a refined notion of what constitutes good acting and substantive roles to work on. He never departed from that until this silly little film, which I wonder how and why it took so long to make it out of the chocolate factory.Chalamet does his best with the inch-deep screenplay which is definitely geared for people whose age or IQ is under 12. You can occasionally see him bemused in some scenes, which tells you that' he's aware of how silly the proceedings are.Don't get me wrong. We all love our happy-go-lucky films for the kiddies with no dark humor or complex plotting to weigh our spirits down, but an actor like Chalamet chewing this material is what any good cinephile would consider heresy. I can understand the washed-up Hugh Grant picking up a paycheck for mugging as an oompa-loompa. But Chalamet is anything but over-the-hill so it's a bit early for him to start selling out to easy material that carries no weight. Don't start slipping, Chalamet. This is a cruel business.",
    "143": "The new Wonka movie presents a visually stunning spectacle, yet falls short in narrative depth. The music, although well-composed, feels out of sync with Wonka's mouth, contributing to the film's superficialaity. The antagonists, while present, miss a sense of genuine malice, leaving one questioning their impact. This lack of depth permeates the movie, challenging its believability despite its fictional roots.References to the original film come across as forced, failing to capture the original's charm. The plot hinges on chance, an element that feels both central and contrived, further distancing the film from a sense of realism. Characters, except for a few, lack realism.Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka, while competent, doesn't fully embrace the eccentricity of Dahl's vision, feeling somewhat restrained. The story's arc, complex and unwieldy, makes it difficult for the audience to fully engage or root for the characters' journey.",
    "144": "Just perfect 😍 .Enjoyed every moment, could not be any better, went with good expectations because of the amazing Cast but again it was more surprisingly just perfect, we laughed, we cried with the characters the movie gave a very beautiful atmosphere in the auditorium .Everything was as is needs to be, and as a person who does not like musical in general i loved EVERY song in this movie.I don't usually write reviews but after watching this movie , I just felt that I MUST write one because it deserve it and it deserves more than what it was given till now .If you are going to watch it then enjoy it.",
    "145": "Out of all of Roald Dahls books, Charlie and the chocolate factory has to be the one that needed another big screen adaptation the least. After 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory you may of been of the thinking like myself that this story has had enough big screen adaptations. That is however apparently not the case according to Warner Bros and here we have a third adaptation of that very same story, 2023's Wonka.Directed by Paddingtons Paul King and staring Timothee Chalamaladingdong as Willy himself. The story is prequel to the original 1971 film and follows Wonka as he tries to bring his chocolate to the masses. He is however not alone in this pursuit and the chocolate cartel that already reside in the centre of the city want Wonka gone. Firstly, I remember very little about the '71 film as it failed to have much of an impact on me as a child. I did however grow up with the 2005 film which whilst far from perfect I enjoy despite this perhaps being an unpopular opinion. Being that I'm now into my 20's I can't say I was that exited for another Willy Wonka film however I'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised.The thing that perhaps surprised me the most was that the film commits to being a musical. Whilst the other two films certainly have songs, I wouldn't say they were musicals per se however this one certainly is. I didn't feel the trailer made that clear but perhaps that was intentional as musicals of late do tend to do poorly at the box office. The songs themselves whilst not anything I'm going to be listening to over and over again were enjoyable and worked well with the films premise. A premise based on a man who is selling more than chocolate he's selling dreams and doing so against a cartel who are simply selling chocolate at extortionate prices (Cadbury I'm looking at you) to make their wallets fatter. The music only added to the magic and the sense of wonderment that the film provides. Every character in this film is very cartoonish and the films target audience is clearly younger children however I think adults will still find things to enjoy here too. I did at times think the main villains the chocolate cartel were a bit overly silly to the point where they are no longer menacing however this didn't impact my enjoyment of the film overall.Compared to the 2005 film it's a very positive take with an optimistic Wonka who has nothing but the upmost trust in people which could at times be mistaken for naivety. Generally I'm not a happy go lucky person and I do still prefer the bleakness of the 2005 film however I can't deny I left this film with a beaming smile and despite it not being directly a Christmas film it does have a Christmassy feel to it.",
    "146": "There's a lot of things to say about this film, I guess we could call a prequel to the original Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory from 1971. Sometimes filmmakers make amazing prequels -Cruella (2021), comes to mind- other times not so much.The story takes us to the very beginning of the Chocolate Factory and the adventures and misadventures a young Willy Wonka had to face on his way of making his dream into reality.There's all sorts of new things happening in this movie. For instance we learn about how Willy Wonka and his first Oompa Loompa met and what had to happen for them to start working together -which added some color to the story, both figuratively and literally speaking-. Another thing, which some die-hard fans of the original film were not happy about, is that they turned Wonka into this joyful and agreeable creature - a gentle magician that pulls things out of his top hat ala Mary Poppins, if you will- someone that doesn't have a mad and scary side, totally unlike the previous interpretations of this peculiar character. So if you're one of those people that loved those unrestrained and darker scenes that we have seen in the previous films (yes I'm referring to the famous boat/tunnel of terror scene) well let's just say this might not be your cup of hot chocolate.Also let's not forget this movie is a musical, therefore expect to hear songs. Now whether the songs are as good as the original 1971 film, or whether they are any good for that matter, that too is open for debate.So all in all, I can understand why fans of the 1971 classic would be annoyed about some aspects of this movie, but let's be honest, the bar was high to begin with, however the question remains, is it not a good film? I kinda wish the first half of it was not as slow, the second half sort of makes up for it with some exciting thrills and action.In the end, I guess only time will tell whether this movie will stand the test of time or fade into obscurity like so many recent remakes, prequels and sequels * cough Mary Poppins Returns cough *.",
    "147": "LIKES:The Setting\n-We're back in the origins of the inventor, which means stepping back in time, and King's direction has executed tis well.-Glorious European design by trade brings an old timey delight that Wonka held long ago. Streets abuzz with society in these gorgeous streets of cramped alleys, large squares, and buildings that hold so much charm.-It provides that classic 1971 feel, but holds the Tim Burton charms and presentation at points to blend the world into a playground best for sharing candy treats.-As the movie progresses, the imagination comes to life to continue to give Dahl's extreme fantasy setting life, helping fill in with color, to what started as a very greyish world.The Costumes\n-Adding even more personality are the various costumes that come into the works.-Certainly no Marvel or Star Wars, Wonka's elements again go back to tradition and matching the very evolution and practicality of fashion, as seen in various piece films.-The suits are straight and stiff, the dresses are flowing and conservative, but hold status, and the \"riff-raff\" have more character than the elite, that only continues to grow with each sale of chocolate.-And Wonka himself may not be the aura of personality like the other movies, but that traditional look is still there, has explanation, and like the others gradually shapes into the beginning of the madness.The Acting\n-A solid cast to bring the life, King's recruitment of actors and actresses was delightful in bringing a Dahl story to life.-I'm going to focus on four in this cast, because the list is first billed, but be assured that King has brought together people to make a cast that fits in the Whimsical Wonka World.Keegan-Michael Key is a fun twist to his Christmas Movie on Netflix. He's a fun antagonist, gruff, but clumsy, using comedy as his forte to make things fun, and an expression that feels very child and goofy. Fantastic line delivery that felt like solid ad-libbing, he netted points for the fun feeling.Paterson Joseph as Slughorn is a fine leader of the Cartel. Malicious, conniving, greedy, and more fill his delivery with spice, but never quite losing that fairytale restraint for a movie to be too scary or loud in a kid's movie. An excellent blend of malice and silliness I expected.-Calah Lane a wonderful member who holds the heart and soul of Dahl's focus, the child aspect with adult lessons to learn. Lane brings a lot to her role as Noodle, a fantastic dreamer, but hard knock life delivery that is perfect for this movie. Her chemistry with Chalamet is spot on and I loved her engagement with the camera.-Of course Chalamet is the star and once again dips well into a movie with commitment, talent, and accuracy in getting an aspect of Wonka. He's charming, goofy, vulnerable, and inspiring all at once, and that hard combination is done well for much off the movie. Solid interactions, great physical acting, and that gleam he matches to Wilder's look long ago, quite chilling in just how good this guy is.The Story/Sentimentality\n-It's a Dahl origin story, and while I don't know how much is from his notes and works, I must say it felt welcoming to the Wonka universe.-Wonka keeps to the writer's focus on fantasy worlds, good lessons, and the consequences that come from greed, all nicely portrayed in that same coy jab that we've seen.-Yet, the movie takes the musical element and starts to expand more on Wonka, adding these touching moments that Burton did that hold deeper ties and investment that further mold Wonka into something more.-And all while keeping it fun for kids, the stories that come together have sentimental value, and keep to elements of fun Wonka's world is known to have.The Music To A Degree\n-It's a musical, and you need music. Fortunately, Wonka has you covered... at least to a degree.-The quality is spot on for a theater visit, great use of instruments, tight control over vocals, and a solid use of technology to get you into the number.-Each song does add that Dahl story telling twist, one part moral boosting, one part character examining, and plenty of parts aspiration and dreams that Wonka always sings for the audience.-There are touching piano solos, blends of splendid instruments blaring, and the numbers themselves have elements that feel like others, helping boost the themes and messages as only movies can.-That's the delight of the Wonka music to a reviewer and fan like me.The Special Effects\n-Better than the original, technology evolution has done much to help make these worlds come to life.-Wonka, to me, feels like a theater show with special effects of the cinema, glorious sets that only computers and a studio can make to help add that immersion factor.-Several accidents have much better evolution than 1971, with chocolate, candy, and other delights matching that look of Burton's studio.-And to keep the animation looking real with what looks practical and CGI mixed, again a solid entry in my eyes that really just brings Dahl's words to life.The Comedy\n-By far one of my favorite elements is the comedy. A blend of adult and kid humor that never crosses the line to inappropriate.-Wonka's stumbling and naivety, the sarcasm of Noodle, the idiocy of the constable and the villains... it all works in a nice balanced use to relieve the moments.-The winner is Hugh Grant, an Oompa Loompa with attitude, sarcasm, and quite honestly the most traditional Wonka charm of the bunch. Perhaps an influence to the latter, perhaps not, he was my favorite element in use that blends older humor tastes, with new generation flair.The Charming Feeling\n-What ties it all together is the charm and delight of the Wonka-verse in this movie.-Paul King has done this tirelessly in his movies, and Wonka somehow has that youthful feeling that still speaks to the kid inside of me.-Like Paddington, this movie just holds so much, speaks so deep, and is just a fun escape that got me back into the movies and away from the Internet wars.-That's why this film has the heart and shininess to it, and makes for a good time out with groups at just how much the hope, inspiration, and struggles you can see without getting too lost in \"new directions.\"DISLIKES:The Pacing Inconsistency\n-There are times the movie is slow as molasses, slogging through awkward world building, and the first day struggles on the town.-Then there are times where it's like The Flash has taken over and achieved the impossible, or maybe shown how far work ethic has fallen.-Either way, Wonka's issue is time balance, editing that took out a lot and made an inconsistent up and down that could have had better use.-It's not the worst, but, I wonder what potential it had if these elements could have been extended or smoothed out on the story, numbers, and fun.The Plot Hole Issues\n-Let's get this out, we don't know if this a true prequel or if this is a new start based on the Internet, so let's just focus on this movie.-Wonka's got great consistency, but again, there are things that don't make sense that I can't say too much to spoil.-Let's just say the crafting element seems a bit too fantasy, some of the building opportunities are a bit too fast, and the suspense of disbelief a tad more than what a Dahl story had.-I'd have liked to see time balance help iron this out, and perhaps more time to talk, but again, this movie was doing a lotMissing Wonka's Darker Wit\n-Wonka is coy, sarcastic, and a bit of a darker and sterner side to his comedy. I missed that in this movie.-Yet, as this is before the infamous spy ordeal, I get why it might not be there and we only see the dreamer side.-Story aside, missing that sarcasm and that comedic spike was something I held, fortunately filled by the Oompa Loompa that would accompany about a third of the movie.The Music On Another Role\n-By far the most disappointing to me, is the splendor of the music and the unique quality\n-Frozen, Greatest Showman, La La Land, and others are better to me in terms of variety of musical numbers than this film, a shame given the potential of the director and the world.-Wonka's music is good quality, but many numbers start out the same, many have the same build up and opening, then kind of get different later in the song.-Not that they aren't good, but without the visual elements to help, the songs didn't have quite the portfolio of originality that I had hoped, leaving me disappointed that the musical element sort of flopped outside of the Wonka dream tone.The VERDICT\nIt may not be a dive into the factory, but Wonka turns out to be one of the most fun movies I've seen in a very long time. That whimsical nature and Paul King's direction, really blends youth and experience together diving back into the world that grabbed me at five years old. It's a quality world building and special effects use, enough to make the impossible, possible, but never overwhelm it. A family film with so much charm, it really was a fun dive into the origins and escapism that made a theater visit fun with the technology ad songs. Such a charming cast and tight direction made this movie worth every penny, and though missing some variety, some of that factory wit, and even a little more of the adult fortitude, Wonka accomplished a lot and made the whole experience super fun and engaging to say the least. I find this movie to be quite worth a recommendation, and hope that under King's direction, we get a few more installments into this world of Wonka. My scores of this musical melody movie are:Adventure/Comedy/Family: 7.5-8.0\nMovie Overall: 7.0-7.5.",
    "148": "Why does the movie industry feel the need to keep re-creating good, classic movies? Do they have no craftmanship and creativity anymore?This is a huge disappointment that they would even bother funding and making such a movie, leave the good classics alone. There was no need for another 'Willy Wonka'/'Wonka. We've already had two!I recommend people watch the original or Johnny Depp's version, the first two were pretty good, this new re-vamp is just silly and not needed.STOP RE-CREATING OUR CLASSIC FAVOURITE MOVIES!If the movie industry seriously can not come up with better ideas for new movies they are crazy, I have a million ideas for brand new fresh movies, there is no need to keep resurrecting the good old movies (which are not even old).Try better. Try making something NEW and fresh, not ruining the movies we all grew up watching. Hate it.",
    "149": "This movie had a number of beautiful callouts to the original movie with Gene Wilder - like the wondrous melodic tunes and the colorful \"land of chocolate\" imagery. I absolutely LOVED those things about this movie.However - the movie portrays Willy Wonka as some kind of wizard, capable of doing actual magic ... not magician-type tricks, but actual conjuring of virtually any kind of physical objects or landscapes .... albeit chocolate related. This is what confused the heck out of me.He's not supposed to have magical powers. He's supposed to be an eccentric, highly imaginative, and innovative chocolatier..Neither the book nor the two previous movies with Wilder and Depp portray Wonka this way. Even in this movie, he's just supposed to be a magician ... but then does continuous magical conjuring throughout the movie.I know ... the movie is a fictional fantasy and there's a lot of creative license allowed - esp. In kids movies. But I've never seen it this grossly overstated. If they wanted to go in this direction, fine - make clear at the beginning that he's a magical being.Anyway - I did emotionally enjoy the striking visuals, the references to the music of the original, Wonka's determined optimist attitude ... and, of course, every scene with Hugh Grant. However my brain rejected the storyline for the reason I mentioned.If you're fan of the books or.any of the previous movies - you're going to feel the need to check this out. Hopefully, you'll be more open to the storyline."
