    "0": "What do the haters complain about? And why you should still watch this final edition.1 The first Indiana Jones editions were the best.This new edition has got the same spirit, the same amount of action, the same amount of adventure and I loved it (almost) as much as the early editions.2 The leading actress Phoebe is a disaster.My personal opinion is that she aint bad at all. She shines. And dont forget she doesnt have to carry this movie, Harrison Ford does.3 Harrison Ford has gotten old and grumpy.Correct. He has been always grumpy! And yes, he has gotten old and director James Mangold shows Indiana's old age in all of it's demise AND glory. Respect!4 There are no jokes. It's too serious with too many killings.Rubbish. There are still enough good jokes, but not the \"in your face\" jokes we were used to. But I love the more subtle, indirect jokes.It is more serious though and I LIKE IT. Even an adventure needs some serious notes, to be more credible. And by the way, I am not a kid anymore and so arent many other Indiana fans!5 Steven Spielberg didnt direct it.But James Mangold did and whoever googles Mangold's Imdb carreer, soon will find out this director has made some fabulous movies. I applaud his direction!I loved this edition. It had everything I needed in an adventure packed movie. It thrilled me. It made me laugh. And the final scenes really TOUCHED me and gave me goosebumps. I had a wonderful time watching this last edition!Just another solidly made Indiana Jones flick. Enjoy the show!Thank you for reading my 2000 th review on Imdb.",
    "1": "\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is on my top 10 list of all-time favorite movie. I did not feel that \"Dial of Destiny\" gave a proper send off to the francise. It seemed like the first half of the movie is nothing but over the top chase scenes about trying to get possession of the Dial. That first half does not invest time to plant motivation so the viewer will even care about the Dial and who gets possession of it. Also, the Helena character is pretty unlikeable. Her passion is in the wrong place. Indiana is at odds with Helena for most of the movie. They do not make a good team. And then Indiana is a deflated version of Indiana that is kind of depressing. And to top it all off, there is no sense of fun and comedy in the movie. I hope writers have not forgotten how to write a good adventure story. \"Dial of Destiny\" misses the mark on many levels. And it kind of bothered me how much unnecessary killing there was in the movie. That is not family friendly. I wanted to really like \"Dial of Destiny\", but as the movie was progressing, I had to admit the movie was just not working.",
    "2": "I mean Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) may have had its flaws, but still had a sense of fun to it, like an Indiana Jones movie should. There was very little of that here.1969 Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is quite bitter, is about to retire has a college professor and his marriage to Marion is ending, but his feeling for adventure comes back. When his goddaughter named Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) comes to him about a special device that could change the course of history.Some actions are pretty good, Harrison Ford is great has Indy, showing his old age catching up with him. And the de aged scenes are pretty descent. Now Pheobe Waller Bridge is so annoying to watch, her over the top know at all attitude made me want to walk out of theater, and she and Ford just never clicked. Mads Michaelson is pretty good has the bad guy. But the sense of fun just wasn't there this time, as the film started to get to the point, I was losing interest. Some moments I liked, but all in all I was just wanting this to end.",
    "3": "I understand some of the criticisms I've heard surrounding this final Jones outing; it's burdened by a handful of excessively bizarre ideas and an overabundance of characters.But one criticism I'll never understand is that this is somehow disrespectful toward the Indiana Jones character-that it belittles him or mocks him in some way. I could not agree less with this.What I saw today was a film made by a director who understands, respects, and loves this character. He crafted a hearty adventure story that adds depth to Jones and sends him off fondly.Indiana and Helena are characters that are both shown to be capable, intelligent, and protective and they both save each other quite often. They are introduced as closed-off but they wear each others' emotional layers down over the course of the story in subtle, natural ways that really did affect me and make me feel something.The film is shot and directed immaculately-the action is brisk yet hard and thrilling. Sure, the story's ambition requires a LOT of CGI, and it's more noticeable than it should be at times.But that didn't stop me from loving the film because the script is smart, constantly shifting power dynamics and developing character to keep you invested in the world.This is leagues better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and I really hope people avoid the hate train that's been building online and give this last adventure a chance in theaters.",
    "4": "The plot was surprisingly good, as I was expecting some MCU multiverse hijinks but was instead given a more grounded approach to time travel. It felt like a breath of fresh air in that sense.Madds was a good villain. He had a cool backstory and plan in this film and was well-acted.The action was good. Not much with Indiana's whip, which is a bit disappointing. Then again, Ford is in his 80's so I understand. I enjoyed the action scenes despite their limitations.However... Phoebe Waller-Bridge made me wanna walk out of the theatre (not really, because I payed for normal tickets and was seated in a Screen X theatre by mistake). Her lines were awful. She ate food with her mouth open and came across very cocky for no good reason. She didn't seem to deserve to be the character she was. I hated her in this movie.",
    "5": "I just returned from the theatre and now I finally have my own opinion after so many mixed reviews. Those who hate it exaggerate just as they did with Crystal Skull.I know that nobody asked for a fifth movie. But they made one and fortunately for us it's good. It truly is and it doesn't have to be perfect.There were three or four moments where I didn't like Helen. I believe the vast majority of fans know what I'm talking about and agree with it. The rest of the movie is fantastic, including the opening action sequence in 1944 with the de-ageing.The finale was something I would never have guessed and I loved it. No spoilers. If you're like me and you're worried that this movie might suck go watch it. You will enjoy it.",
    "6": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but it's still completely unnecessary. I consider Dial of Destiny to be a second chance at an appendix to Indy's story. The plot of this movie never seems to get out of second gear. In fact, I was surprised when I realized the climax of the film had passed. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is fine in her role, but she seems to be trying to steal the spotlight at times. And while the de-aging visual effect has improved, it just doesn't look quite right. For me, Indiana Jones is still a trilogy that concludes with the Last Crusade.",
    "7": "There is no way you can fix the industry and begin producing good movies again if you can still make tens of millions of profit with this bad casting, this bad script, this bad editing and this bad production.I've always thought that nobody worse than Shia LeBeouf could be cast in this franchise but Phoebe Waller Bridge... Wow!Sometimes, as a producer, you should finish the product, then watch it and decide not to release it out of self respect.Even The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull couldn't ruin the legacy for me but Phoebe Waller Bridge managed to do it in 5 minutes.A young Harrison Ford CGI dubbed by the actual one was just tragic.",
    "8": "So happy to have Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones - the iconic Indiana Jones - back on the big screen. Some impressive CGI work to make Indy a young man again as he battles the Nazis at the end of World War Two before events fast forward about twenty years, though the Nazis are still the bad guys. I've always said that Indiana Jones is at his best when battling the Nazis, and it is true again in the fifth and final instalment of the series. Indiana Jones is a world-weary, basically-retired archaeologist when he is roped into one last adventure, basically against his will. The fedora is there, the whip, the impish grin and the occasional one-liner. So are the big action set pieces that have made the series so popular, and I liked the nods to Father Time (which I guess no one can escape) that permeate the movie, as Indiana Jones looks to his future, whilst fighting a foe from his younger days, with a couple of well-designed cameos from familiar faces. A delight to sit in the cinema and watch a fitting conclusion to one of my favourite film series. Thoroughly enjoyed this.",
    "9": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny opens as archaeologist Indiana attempts to wrest the fabled Spear of Longinus from the Nazis. When Indy gets his hands on the artefact, it turns out to be a fake, a worthless reproduction -- ironic, because in the prologue, Jones himself is a reproduction, an unconvincing CGI version of the young Harrison Ford, and the film as a whole is a worthless imitation of the far better films that preceded it (yes even Crystal Skull is better).Incredibly, the digitally de-aged Ford isn't the worst thing about this latest instalment in a franchise that should have hung up its fedora for good after the last debacle.Firstly, the cast is awful. This is a Raiders film, so we have to have Ford on board, but he really is way too old now for this kind of movie -- an octogenarian doing the things he does in this film is laughable. We get Toby Jones as Indy's sidekick in the overlong prologue (there's something about him that really grinds my gears) and Mads Mikkelsen as the villain (what inspired casting -- NOT!), but worst of all are Phoebe Waller-Bridge as horsey heroine Helena, and HER sidekick, a mono-browed teenage pickpocket named Teddy (Ethann Isidore). Thought that Willy and Short Round were kinda irritating? This pair take insufferable to a whole new level.Then there's the not inconsiderable absence of Spielberg behind the camera: he might have messed up with the last Indy film, but with the original trilogy under his belt, it's easy to be a little forgiving of one dud. James Mangold, on the other hand, deserves no such goodwill: he's taken a much loved character and put him in some of the most uninspired action scenes imaginable: say what you want about the 'nuking the fridge' scene, or Mutt swinging with the apes, but at least those were memorable. Dial of Destiny is one forgettable set-piece after another, directed with zero flair (the sloppy editing not helping matters).Now let's consider the script. Indiana Jones does time travel. It's every bit as stupid as Indiana Jones meeting aliens, but somehow it also manages to be incredibly dull and tedious, with none of the sense of wonder and magic that one expects from the franchise. I only watched the film an hour ago and already I'm struggling to recall certain scenes, it's all so unremarkable. There's plenty of predictable fan service, but that only serves to remind the viewer of how much better the original films were. To make matters worse, the whole mess is dragged out to an excruciating two hours and thirty-four minutes.In short, we can add Indiana Jones to the ever growing list of once great franchises that Disney has purchased and then stomped all over. 3/10 -- I wasn't expecting it to be great, but this was worse than I imagined.",
    "10": "Daredevil archaeologist Indiana Jones races against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history.Accompanied by his goddaughter, and a wannabe Short-Round, he soon finds himself squaring off against Jürgen Voller, a former Nazi who works for NASA, and his henchmen, one who looks like Pat Roach, and one who Mangold must like because he was the bad guy in Logan.....Did this film really need to be made? There are two camps in regards to this. For people who really disliked KOTCS, yes, because they wanted him to go out with a bang. And no, they should have left it with Last Crusade, and didn't really want to see Ford don the fedora one more time.Did I enjoy it?Through gritted teeth I say yes. But am I saying I enjoyed it because I love the franchise, and I can't bring myself to say it was a tad boring in places and I should have deserved it more because I grew up with Indiana Jones?Time will tell, which is ironic considering the maguffin.Ford as expected is brilliant, and we see a disillusioned, very different Indy in him. He's slightly bitter at the world because of something that happened a few years before, and he's weary, tired of everything around him, almost becoming an artefact himself, as he appears reluctant to accept the changing world around him.The first twenty minutes is truly astonishing, and up there with the best set pieces of the franchise, but still the poorest of all of the films openings. And unfortunately the de-aging effects are pretty poor, and the fact that his voice sounds older is jarring at times, and really puts you off at times. But once we are on the train, it goes full pelt.After that, it does go slightly downhill, and never reaches the heights of the opening. Waller-Bridge is a welcome addition to the franchise, and she holds her own against Ford, even though she can be slightly annoying at times. And she has her own Short-Round following her about. And guess what? They met the same way as Indy met Shorty.Mikkelsen is truly wonderful as the big evil, and he oozes menace and charm in equal measures. This is one great villain, and Mikkelsen knows that his character is brilliant.There is a really good chase sequence in the middle of the film, it's funny, pretty breathtaking, and harks back to the first three movies. Another highlight of the movie.But there are a few negatives.Banderas is wasted, and I feel that a lot of his scenes were left on the cutting room floor. He barely has any lines, and the scenes we see him almost depict him as a very stupid person. Seeing that he is on the main posters for this just made me slightly annoyed, as he must only have about two minutes of screen time. It's a real problem for me, how ever trivial it may seem.Apart from one very touching scene, they reference the other films too bluntly, especially TOD, which is mentioned twice for some reason, and it's just a little cringey, especially when TOD is my favourite of the franchise (cinema trips with my dad we're golden days, that's why I love it).And then there is the final act. Depending on how you feel, this could be genius, or just plain stupid. But seeing as he has found the Holy Grail, The Ark of The Covenant, and dealt with aliens, I'll let it pass. But it's so random it will make you think 'really?' for a hot second.And one last thing, the film reminded me a little of Hudson Hawk. Both films have our heroes looking for different parts of an object across the world, and the object in question will change the world. But that's not a critique at all, just something I noticed.So all in all, it's a fun movie. A little slow at times, but I could not see a reason to cut anything from the film to make it a little shorter. It's not great, but die hard fans will get something out of this.A grower for sure.",
    "11": "Take the soul, ruin the hero, add a girl boss. Disney has never done it better.The first part of the move, oddly enough feels somewhat like a real Indiana Jones movie. Fade to black.Now Indy is a sad, pathetic shell of himself wallowing in alcohol and self-pity. Just what I wanted to see.This movie is almost vindictive in tone, trying to bury the past for a future of Phoebe Waller Bridge--one of the most unlikeable characters ever to hit the screen.Indeed, the only thing that passes for a character arc is that she's not as big an ass at the end as she is in the beginning.How on earth could anyone enjoy this who saw the first three? I'm sorry I wasted my time and there's no way to unsee it. I desperately wish there were.",
    "12": "It's a pity that a few intelligent people ruined the last Indi movie so much. Is no one really paying attention? George Lucas, where have you been? Don't you have anything to say anymore? Obviously not.Spoiler allert:\nWorst of all is the Helena character. The woman is just batshit crazy. Has no manners. Treats her Godfather (Indiana) like the last idiot. Then: nobody believes that the woman travels to N. Y. and steals half the disc only to sell it again in Morocco (?) For gambing debts??? What was that about? From then on, the woman is a nightmare in every scene she is in. Her character is just a horrible woman. Zero humor. In every other the movie all the other women were top of their game. Not here.Then this totally superfluous Teddy. Horrible the child, which is simply supposed to be a copy of short round. Why did he actually steal from another young person at the market? Why was there this scene? Completely stupid are the 100 km / h fast TukTuks? Stupid. Why Antonio Banderas played the captain in the first place? He probably just wanted to be there. Anyway.The movie is just boring and again - what were the stupid writers thinking to make Indian Jones look so weak? Harrison, okay at your age and for that much money, then you can do something like that. Nobody wants to see Indiana like in this movie. Maybe someone will just fire Kathleen Kennedy, she is the main person responsible for this stupid, stupid movie.Serves Disney right for losing hundreds of millions of dollars.Worst writing ever!!!!!!!!!",
    "13": "Having seen all the Indiana Jones movies, I was surprised that the studios decided on one more outing. Even more so that Harrison Ford would accept playing the rôle once more. CGI is there to de-age him for the first part of the film and then we see what an 81 year old body looks like on a semi-naked man who's prepared himself with diet and exercise.What Waller Bridge contributed to the writing and acting was unwanted. She has no charisma on the big screen and being signed by a desperate Hollywood to help write a script that was weak and had plot holes from the opening.This was flat, lacked tension, a lot of tell instead of show. Should never have been made.",
    "14": "Dial of Destiny has a great premise and an enjoyable first and third act, but all in all it's brought down by lazy plotting and poor writing in the 2nd act. I'm glad I watched it. It filled a void in the franchise. However, it could and should have been much better. Indy's goddaughter has no redeeming qualities through most of the movie, and she never really arcs in a meaningful way. In the third act, she acts like she finally grows a soul. Unfortunately there's no foreshadowing to make it seem anything but a convenience. She is singlemindedly all about the money for most of the movie, and her actual change of heart comes off as contrived. I found her annoying. The logic used to explain the story beats are quite unfounded and also come across as completely contrived. Worth watching if you're over 70 and couldn't wait to see Raiders when the trailers first appeared on TV. I actually went to a screening with friends who had no idea what they were going to see.",
    "15": "So I thought the movie was going to be terrible specially, because the last one was OK but one prior was awful and I really didn't think this was gonna be that good of a movie because let's face facts Harrison Ford is getting old. Do you know if so, who wants to watch an 80 year old man running around when it doesn't look real. The actress that played Helena was unbelievable. She helped you move. Keep this moving in the right direction. I also saw Harrison Ford was a lot better than I thought it was gonna be like I mean I don't. I'm sure it was a lot of special effects but I don't even know because maybe he does well for the age , so I thought it was gonna look a little ridiculous with him almost like it the way they did everything it looks realistic but it also you know with him constantly talking about how he feels like he's dying made it also realistic like he was an all the sudden superman . The script of the movie was really good. All the collectors were really it had a really good cast from top to bottom. I wish Mary Ann was in the movie a little bit more instead of the cameo at the end right to be honest, I think she was with Andy instead of helana the movie when I'm done . By reading some of the reviews before I watched it and I should've realize they were going to do this. No, I was expecting my God movie I could barely finish glad I was wrong, and it was a good swan, a good goodbye to Indiana Jones. So may I say maybe a whole Lotta Helena Jones? Well, I don't know her last name, but I could see her doing the next one and the new archaeologists. I didn't have the typical Indiana Jones action and then there's a horse see where he's running through subways with a horse it was great.",
    "16": "So much negativity ahead of the release considering the role of a certain female support character. Then lots of stories about early reviews being bad to mediocre at best. We went to see it today and honestly, I liked it.. quite a lot! This isn't a story about replacing Indiana Jones with a female character. This is a really good final film and a worthy send off for our beloved adventurer. Don't expect it to be as good as the original three films. Go in with an open mind and realistic expectations, and you'll walk out entertain and humming a famous tune. In the end that's what Indiana Jones movies are all about.",
    "17": "This movie feels like an Indiana jones movie, that's the best way to put it. Indiana jones here is in his late 70s so he can't do the stuff he used too. It's definitely more character driven and even a little glim and darker at times but I enjoyed that. There are still very cool action and set pieces that bring back nostalgia from the first 3. The opening sequence is awesome and I can't wait to rewatch it. Just pure classic indy. Helena's character here isn't bad, it's kinda like Marion from raiders in a way. This movie may not be on the level or raiders or crusade but I think it's still a very very enjoyable adventure.",
    "18": "+\nThe action was good, the villian was good.The intro scene was pretty atmospheric.%\nThe deaged Indy looked best in the first shot we see him in, its the shot from the trailer but a little better, maybe because of the better bitrate. Later it looked not as good, some shots were ok, some looked like a low resolution ps4 game. I guess the first shot is the most important one to sell the effect tho. Maybe it looks better If you see it in non imax. Its cool that this kind of technology exits but it is not perfected yet. In Crystal skull, they hid the face when it was a too complicated shot to digitally reface the stunt double. Here they that too but in some shots they used cgi and it didnt really blend well all the time.The soundtrack was ok but like in SW Ep 9 there wasnt really any memorable parts. You recognized some reused tunes here and there from other John Williams scores.Maybe Im slow, but why didnt they go back to the river where they dropped the artifact in the beginning?-\nI feel like Indy was underutilized in this movie, in favor for his god daughter. He didnt really do much except for maybe a bit in the opening prologue that made me go \"Indy frack yeah\" while the theme plays. Atleast Crystal skull had that.There was a line that the villian says when talking to Indy, among the lines of \"people dont care about men like us anymore\". Was this some kind of meta thing? This sums up the problem I had with this movie:\nI watch Indy because I care. I want to see Indy be the rock star, he is a bit older now which they acknowledged, so maybe he cant physically do everything anymore, but he is older and should be more experienced. I watched it because I wanted to see Indy as the hero, not his god daughter.It wasnt wrong seeing Indy as the grumpy old grandpa but at the end I felt like he should have been utilized more as the hero.",
    "19": "I didn't hate this film, but I enjoyed it far less than I expected to. (I enjoyed it more than my partner though, who fell asleep during it.) But it was still far less than it could have been.On the plus side: Harrison Ford is still amazing, and can easily carry off an action adventure. There are the usual splendid scenes of Indy fighting on all sorts of moving vehicles. The baddies - Nazis - are easy to dislike. Ethann Isidore as Teddy was simply wonderful - I wish more could have been made of him.That being said, there didn't seem to be anything really new and exciting about this film. Almost all the action scenes we seem to have seen before: cars and motorbikes with sidecars; trains; it's all been done before. A nice touch though was a wild ride through Tangiers on auto-rickshaws - who knew that these little cheap vehicles were in fact turbo-charged and built (to judge from the battering they received) like tanks?The supporting characters were weak. Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw was a poor foil; you couldn't work out if she had any depth at all; she kept saying (even if it wasn't true) that it was \"all about the money\". She simply wasn't a sympathetic character. Mads Mikkelsen as the Nazi Jürgen Voller again played his cards very close to his chest (as it were), delivering most of his lines in a sort of guarded mutter that was at times hard to understand. At no time did he exude any sort of air of malice. It was as though he simply had a job to do; he made for a boring villain.And the humour - always a nice touch in the best Indiana Jones films, was here in very short supply.One of the delights of Indiana Jones films is the inventive ways in which the villains meet their end: recall the melting scene towards the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark; the way that Donovan ages to dust in The Last Crusade. In this film, though, Voller simply dies in a plane crash (albeit in Ancient Greece) - a very prosaic end.And of course - like so many current films - it was too long for its content. Half an hour shaved off and a tighter direction may have made for a better and more disciplined film.My partner, who's Tamil, said that it was a masala (mixture) of a film, and totally lacking in Bollywood singing and dancing. Come to think of it, he's quite right.I'm sorry to see the Indiana Jones films end with this one. It could have been so much better.",
    "20": "Lately I've had a kidney infection yet still wanted to see this since my pain slowed down and so much of it is worth it! The only Indiana Jones film not by Steven Spielberg that was very well directed by James Mangold. I love a couple films by James especially Identity and Logan so that made me even more intrigued on top of how I reviewed the other Indiana films in the last few weeks, crazy how the first one came out 42 years and 2 weeks ago. This is a great entry from start to finish, Harrison Ford is magnificent throughout and so is the exhilarating action. I'm quite impressed how John Williams is around 92 and still does the music. I highly recommend this gem to anyone!",
    "21": "This movie is 100% action, 0% story, 0% heart. The only way this qualifies as an \"Indiana Jones\" movie is that it features Indiana Jones. Other than that, it's just mindless action with no story at all. It was a mistake to have an Indiana Jones movie not directed by Steven Spielberg. Even John Williams' heart was clearly not in this. For a while, I was wondering if he even did the music. Just disappointing on many levels. The whole beginning of the movie was unnecessary to the story. It could have just as easily been something mentioned in a conversation between two characters. And all of the artifacts that Indy ever dealt with, the Dial is the most pointless.",
    "22": "I had thought it would be impossible to produce an Indiana Jones movie that was worse than \"Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull,\" but I was wrong. \"Skull\" was only 2 hours and 2 minutes in length. \"Dial of Destiny\" was 2 hour and 34 minutes of tedium. It had no charm, no wit, not enough action, and all the characters were unlikeable. There is something dreadfully wrong with a film when you like the Nazi more than you like the hero's sidekick (and I say that as a man who considers himself a feminist).If you want to watch a model film about a hero who is past his prime, please watch \"Robin and Marian.\"",
    "23": "If you'd never come across this bloke called Jones, you may think what is this wonder you've been shown, as the start is quite outstanding, it's enthralling, and enchanting, an adventure that's quite rightly overblown; it continues in a vein you've seen before, almost as if you're witnessing one more encore, lots of links to stories past, repeating memes come thick and fast, familiarity means it's just not quite top drawer; but it's better than the Skull that was a cull, on a par perhaps with Doom that was a lull, Crusade and Ark were different league, full of scheming and intrigue, you won't feel empty, but for sure you won't feel full.",
    "24": "As a fan I wanted to feel joy and awe while figuratively traveling alongside Indy going on one last epic adventure. What I got was a big step down from all of his previous journeys, including Crystal Skull. Not to mention, as another commenter pointed, that deconstructing legacy characters/franchises didn't belong here. I think we've reached a point where such approaches to franchises robs certain sequels' purpose to any major series, which is to tell a story and not make it feel like some analytical term paper adapted in the form of a screenplay (eg Matrix Resurrections is a major guilty example of this folly).Also, when I said I wanted to feel awe and joy, this movie lacked those major attributes in exchange for melancholy and moroseness. None of the supporting even tried hard to give the movie any sense of levity. There was a kid, but he was no Short Round. In fact, killing off Mutt was a really dumb mistake. While he didn't have a warm reception, it doesn't mean he couldn't be improved in the follow-up, and killing him off was one aspect that brought the movie down. Oh yeah, he reunited with Marion in the end. But I didn't have any warm feelings of a happy reunion. In my head: \"Hi Marion. By the way, your son's dead.\" It just reeks of studio interference. \"People don't like Mutt so just kill him off. I don't know how you do it, but just do it.\" \"But I wrote a really good arc for him in the movie, and the fans are going to love him now.\" \"Just do it already.\" \"Okay fine. Jeez!\" I mean, he was only mentioned in conversation and then forgotten. We don't see a picture or him anywhere. Bad writing, if you ask me.Furthermore, the whole thing with characters dying on-screen made it a bit too dark and pointless. Why couldn't they have done something with time travel where Indy managed to save his colleagues and son from certain death. A nice Checkhov's gun moment. He goes back in time, and then...that's it. Would've been great if a big chunk of the climax was devoted to Indy stopping the Nazi man from changing history in any other time period, but an underwhelming anticlimactic plane crash would do.You know what would've been the best way to end the series? Atlantis! The ultimate lost ancient city teeming with valuable treasures and whatever mythical MacGuffin they're journeying toward would've been more eventful than a time-traveling Dial that was lame. Heck! Since this is supposed to be Indy's last on-screen adventure, it would've been great to Marion, Mutt, Sallah, Short-Round, and maybe another new travel buddy or two coming along for the biggest adventure that Dial lacked, and wasted it on an idea that was not fitting Indy (ie Just because it worked on Logan, it doesn't work for Indy). I mean, other than the Holy Grail, you can't get bigger than Atlantis. And they squandered it.",
    "25": "You know, come to think of it, I almost feel as if the third Indiana Jones film sort of gave me the impression that it would be the last - especially with a title like 'The Last Crusade'. Mind you, I guess Ford really did want to give it one last crack, especially since he has pretty much said that he is retiring as an actor. In fact, him retiring as an actor, and Jones retiring as a university professor, does fit the character well, and apparently there had been plans to actually release four sequels.Anyway, the film starts during World War II, where Jones and Basil are attempting to retrieve some artifacts from a train heading to Berlin. They believe that the Nazi's have procured the Spear of Destiny, that is the spear that was used to pierce the side of Christ, but as it turns out that it is a fake. However, another artifact has been uncovered - the Antikythera device, which is apparently a lot more powerful.Actually, I was quite thrilled to discover that this whole movie was focused around the device, which was recovered from a Roman wreck off the coast of the island of Antikythera. Apparently it is said to have been one of the earliest examples of a computing device. Mind you, this is Indiana Jones, so of course this device ends up being more than a simple calculating machine.Look, I did like the film, though I have to admit that the chase scenes sort of start to get pretty boring, especially when there seems to be one after the other, and they drag out for way too long as well. However, one think I did like is that there were hints in the film as to what was coming up, especially with the puppet play that they encounter in Sicily. However, there were some problems, namely with one of the explanations as to how they landed up where they did at the end of the film. Honestly, continental drift has nothing to do with it. The other thing was how did the bad guy's find them in Sicily so quickly - I thought they had been given the wrong co-ordinates.Still, other than that, yeah, it was a fitting end to the Indiana Jones films.",
    "26": "The news is very good. Not really an achievement to beat Crystal Skull, but this film smashes it. The opening sequence is sensational, with the CGI at probably 90% realistic vs 70% in Rogue One. It is still, unfortunately, very distracting. Fleabag fans will allow PWB plenty of goodwill, but she is borderline annoying at times. Disney are almost certainly eyeing a franchise for her, no matter what they say. Harrison is in brilliant form and delivers precisely what you expect. Nice Easter Eggs littered throughout and the best villain since Temple of Doom. Solid, satisfying and very enjoyable 7/10.",
    "27": "Ok so I understand she is flavour of the month but this film became unwatchable as soon as she appeared in it. I loved the Indiana films up till this one and it started out good. Mars is great casting, he plays his part well. But the character played by Phoebe is just so unlikeable and horribly british (which I am too but she is an embarrassment in this) and I think there must be plenty of other actresses that could have played it far better. Maybe she just belongs in downtown abbey but she is very one sided. Harrison has the capability of doing a really good job but I'm sorry to say in this he was completely let down by his supporting actress.",
    "28": "While I cannot say that I truly hated this film, I cannot say that I loved it either. The first 15-25 minutes, give or take, are enjoyable. It was exciting and it felt like an Indiana Jones movie. However, the movie begins to crumble from there. I felt like I was checking my watch every 15 minutes or so. There were moments where I was bored and I honestly didn't care for some of the characters like Helena. Her character was there only to help create a story that was lacking in truly wrapping up Indiana Jones' story. The action was great, Indiana Jones was great, but that is all I really enjoyed from this film.",
    "29": "This final installment of the Indiana Jones series was somewhat of a letdown. I feel like the opportunity for an excellent story was missed. I understand that Indiana Jones is older in this installment but there was something missing, I can't put my finger on it. Was it the writers aim for us to feel a little sorry for Indy? I wonder. In addition, this film didn't have the wit we have grown accustomed to from the franchise and WOW there was so much killing/shooting in this installment, I actually was kind of surprised by that. The killings were more than I have ever seen during this series. There was a little girl sitting in front of me and I could only imagine her mother regret for bringing her to see this particular movie. Some positives was the action scenes were typical Indian Jones flare and were exciting and enjoyable. I must say the character Helena was not likable, but maybe she wasn't meant to be and the young boy in the movie seemed thrown into the script, not much added value in my opinion. It was nice seeing some cameo appearances and the final scenes were heartwarming. I don't regret going to see the movie because it is the last film in the series and I needed to see the film on the big screen, but if you are a true fan of the series like I am I suggest you go to the theater and send Indy off for ol times sake :)",
    "30": "This movie was terrible. Is starts out well enough with maybe 15 minutes of action with a de-aged Indiana Jones fighting the nazis at the end of world war two.Then it all falls apart. Fast forward 25 years and Indy is a bitter old divorced loser who has nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to. But wait, here comes his goddaughter (from a supposed best friend we never knew about until now)! She's smart, much smarter than this pathetic old man. She's snotty. She's arrogant. She's beyond annoying. Kathleen Kennedy, is that you???So yeah, for the rest of the movie Indy serves as the pale reflection to make this annoying woman look good. He's stupid and slow, she's fast and smart and strong.To add insult to injury, they bring back Sallah from the previous movies (Gimli from Lord of the Rings) for a few minutes. He wants to adventure with Indy, and asks if he can join him. Wouldn't that be great? That's what fans want to see! But nope, the writers can't let that happen of course. It would take away from their annoying stupid new main character, the snotty girl! So Indy tells Sallah to get lost, and that's the last we see of him. Pathetic.If Disney thinks this kind of drivel is what fans want to see, they're mistaken. Nobody wants their childhood idols toppled and made into pathetic old fools, who were never even good to begin with apparently, says Disney. Nobody wants to see your annoying virtue-signaling messaging, your Mary Sue replacement characters, your bad CGI, and your obvious seething hatred at having to make a movie in a franchise that you either despise or don't understand, or both.May Disney lose hundreds of millions on this piece of fan disrespect.",
    "31": "This was a lot more fun than I expected, and I pretty much purely expected a romp. The and shots and attention to historical nostalgia and great set design, really all the production is just hit out of the park. Way more jokes than I expected landed, the story is very well paced, knowing what is appealing about the franchise and playing to its strengths.What I didn't expect, was how chefs kiss the ending would be. The third act goes a bit off the rails, otherwise the movie is 4*+, but it really, really nails the ending, along with the treatment of the Nazis and the outcome. It really treats that element well and actually has a little something to say about Indie, which was icing on the top. Everything talked about in the film is used for content, with fun foreshadowing occurring that I doubt anybody would really expect. Just a great time.",
    "32": "I think this is better than the crystal skull, I think the story was way more engaging and a better plot. Nazi's and Indiana Jones are required. It was a movie of up's and downs and I don't mean emotionally, I mean there would be a sequence I like but then straight after it would be an annoying sequence.I don't know about everyone else but I feel Indiana Jones was the worst part about this. The Daughter was also soooo good at everything of course and I also found it hard to hear her? Especially in the ludicrous chase scene in Tangier. I felt like the kid added zero to this film apart from having him there the whole time just to follow them through the time portal to fly them home. The first 45 minutes there were about 50 one punch knockouts with also about 10 captures of Indiana where you're left thinking just maim the guy or kill him. He escapes so many times it blows your mind.Mads was great as the villain but seemed to just have that timing like the French guy from raiders of the lost arc, just always turned up jusssst as Indiana worked something out.I did enjoy the mystery solving I'm a sucker for that and some good action mixed in with some average action I'm fine with. I was glad that at the end they went full speed into the ending and didn't hold back, I was hoping they were actually going back in time and I loved that they did and didn't fake out not go through the portal.If you like Indiana Jones and didn't like Crystal Skull you'll still go see this.",
    "33": "That was fantastic! It had a great opening. Great action sequences. The de-aging parts were not an issue to me. I barely noticed and really the action around it was too awesome and fun to even care about it. I had an ear to ear grin the entire time! Not sure what other critics were expecting or watching. For me this movie had a certain checklist:Fun ✅\nAction ✅\nIndy being Indy ✅\nMystery ✅\nMemorable characters ✅\nHumor ✅It's not perfect or the absolutely best film in the series but it's also not the train wreck that it's being made out to be. Best advice is always to just to watch it and judge yourself. Great flick!",
    "34": "Keeping Indiana Jones alive this long is essentially elder abuse on a cinematic scale. Disney is out to destroy all white male character heroes (Indiana Jones, Star Wars) and Kathy Kennedy and the other Disney/Lucasfilm execs are making it happen. First Star Wars was flushed down the toilet and now what's left of elderly Indiana being shocked back to life and dragged out for one more squeeze at the box office. Absolutely disgusting. If these characters were ladies, feminist academics would be teaching courses on the destruction of modern womanhood in contemporary cinema based solely on what we're seeing here. But they get away with it because the gender script is flipped. Let Indiana Jones rest in peace.",
    "35": "What I hated most about this movie is the chase scenes. They are so boring and unrealistic. The story is pretty interesting and the acting of Ford is good as always. I don't like that writers always repeat stuff in sequels that they THINK the fans want to see: Nazis, snakes, gross insect, a smart boy, same old friend, the complete Indiana Jones suit with hat and whip. I'd rather see something new! This may sound weird but after the Trilogy the only two movies for me that had Indiana Jones vibes were the mummy (1999) and the first national treasure movie (2004) because they were new and exiting.",
    "36": "This very sentence comes from the most annoying character of the movie, referring to Indy. And for the most part it's sadly true, he's not running the show. But he should be. Seemingly the writers for some reason failed to understand the essence of Indiana Jones. He's not supposed to be part of history, he needs to save it, preserve it. Yes he sees things that cannot be explained, magical, outworldly things, but he never loses sight of his calling: archeology: saving things that belong in a museum.An aging Indy should've opened many doors to highlight his experience, his wisdom, but unfortunately he needs to be saved far too often. Indy doesn't need to be saved! He's the one who saves the day!The story itself stays interesting, the casting is good, Harrison Ford still has it and there are scenes where the movie really shines, but sadly the creators misunderstood the core, the essence we grew to love.",
    "37": "The ending is awful. I was expecting him to put his hat on the kid or at least go back and save his son with the dial. I thought this was the whole point when he said he would go back and save his son. I mean given the chance why the hell wouldn't you save your son? It is probably because Shia Labeouf was his son and he won't do another and regrets doing Crystal skull. They could have cast somebody else maybe, but that's obviously the reason. The thing is disney love to make more films just look at Star Wars. There's money to be made from Indianna Jones. So I thought this would have been passing the torch but it wasn't.Also the lead actress I couldn't stand her. Her demeanour and look was more of a villain than a hero. Plus for 9/10 of the movie she was kind of villain with the way she acted. The bad guy was brilliantly cast.Started off brilliantly, then slowly got worse as the film went on. Worth a watch don't get me wrong. But it could have been so much better. They had a time machine, and hardly used it!",
    "38": "The movie was a bit better than I expected because it did start off well with Indiana once again up against the Germans in the third reich time period, but for me that was where the movie peaked as the story became less interesting as it went on. The movie did become a bit more intriguing when they time travelled back to the Roman empire time period which was kind of cool to see, but the damage was already done as most of the movie was just generic. I also wasn't a fan of the character Helena who I felt was unreliable and unlikeable. I even didn't like Teddy as I felt he wasn't charismatic enough and felt like he wasn't needed in the story. On the plus side at least it was better than the Crystal Skull.",
    "39": "I'll save you the time. Disney defiles everything they touch, and this is the prime example. This junk movie is exactly the mess you were expecting. The critics have spoken, and they re right. You can almost feel sorry for this mess if it were not for Phoebe Waller Bridge, possibly one of the most annoying actresses today. She tries to upstage Ford with practically ever line she utters, and she is just plain obnoxious in a very patronizing way like your left wing, trust fund cousin (fill in her name) that you can't stand. 80 year old Ford himself doesn't fare much better a a broken, boozy Indiana in his twilight years. His CGI 'de ageing' scenes early in the film have a very disturbing creepiness about them. This film was in development hell for three years and it shows. I also heard there were several reshoots too. Story has something to do with an ancient device that may offer some clues for time travel. The Nazis get hold of it and after the war, they are recruited by the US space program. All the action is predictable, the set pieces are rendered in terrible CGI, there is a horseride through a NY subway, and a rather uninspired minicab chase that seems to mirror the truck race in 'Raiders'. And to make matters worse, most of the film has a dark , gloomy color (pallor?) to it. It all looks very cheap even if it cost 300 million dollar to make. And at 2 and a half hours, its about 45 minutes longer than it should be. There is no sense of fun, joy, or excitement that made he first three installment the only ones worth watching And if Sallah can't make you smile,you know it will be a ride not worth taking. A cash grab and very undignified funeral, eulogy and burial of fine series. Speilberg, Mangold, and Lucas,shame on you! This one was so bad, it made me change my 2008 1 star rating of 'The Crystal Skull'\nto 4 stars. Another 'number two' P. U. movie review from Lou.",
    "40": "Tonally, technically and aesthetically, I felt it was very competent, and reminiscent of the franchise. However, I don't think the nuts and bolts of the plot and the Dial were elaborated, distinctive or engaging enough. The plot felt more like a hollow vehicle for set pieces.Longer than necessary in my opinion, and not sure if they strayed far enough from the 'race against the Nazis for treasure' formula. Jones' allies in this film weren't hugely memorable, and made me realise the importance of entertaining allies in previous instalments.I think overall, they didn't get the tone quite right for what should have been a loving celebration.",
    "41": "This Indiana Jones movie was spectacular!!! . Great acting from everyone as well as amazing cinematography and amazing musical scores. They did a great job of making it feel just like all of the other Indiana Jones, movies, and ranks up there with the best of them. Great to see them get back on track after the dismal Chrystal skulls movie! Ignore all of the haters in the reviews. There is nothing to dislike about this movie. It was kind of long, but still action packed and worth the time. I won't give away any spoilers, but there are great cast members that you haven't seen for a long time that will make appearances here that you will love.",
    "42": "Nothing is ever going to compare or be as epic as the original blockbuster films, but at least this film was a nice send-off. The production value of the sets, props, landscapes and s/vfx were outstanding. The score was the same as the original films, so that complimented this one. All casting and performances were spot-on. What dragged this film down was the the second act. The first and last acts were excellent and were as close to having the magic the earlier films had, but the middle act felt too long and dragged out, that made the 154 min runtime feel like it was much longer. Had the middle cut some of the filler out, I feel the entire film would've been more enjoyable. Nevertheless, a decent final installment and farewell to the franchise.",
    "43": "What a great movie. They have kept it to the style of the other movies. Fast paced and action packed. Harrison Ford although now grey has still got it. I loved the story. I was so relieved as being an Indie fan it was a worry that it wouldn't be as good. Definitely worth seeing at the pictures. There are some real brilliant bits to this movie. It's quite emotional watching it. I don't want Indie getting old but he isn't immortal. We have all been on the journey with him. There is only one Indie and that's Harrison Ford. Phoebe Waller Bridge is very good. Very talented woman. Great seeing Toby Jones in this. One of my faves. As is Antonio Banderas.",
    "44": "I saw this on the day before the official release, and unfortunately this is the worst of the 5 movies. Yes, Crystal Skull is better. The first 20 minutes, (the flashback scene), are good, and then it's downhill from there. The movie is clearly missing Spielberg's touch and the whole movie didn't feel like an Indiana Jones film. Lots of action with no memorable scenes and weak new characters you don't care about. Indy is a grumpy old man that has his goddaughter bossing him around and upstaging him at every turn. The brilliant and courageous Indy of the previous four movies, is just a dopey old man that no one would have watched in any movie. After leaving the theater I really couldn't recall anything worth remembering and had the feeling that they probably should have not made this movie at all! Should have ended it with Crystal Skull. Now we'll get Helena Indy spinoff, yay!",
    "45": "Another boring movie from the fantasy killers - disney...\nSorry.This \"movie\" is a dead-born from its scratch.No fun at all...Bad actor performance. CGI on Ford's face, bad as Henry Cavil's Superman ...\nOnly Mads Michelson is the perfect one.Plot holes after plot holes...Another bad movie from disney. I cant understand why they continue to kill franchises...Everyone remembers SW dead saga....\n4th IJ was a bad one...Who needed another sloppy movie?Everything is hilarious. Even the parody film \"Top Secret\", had more fun, drama and logic. Everything is predictable and as I sad utterly boooring...\nUnfortunately I can't give minus points here, so only 1 for IJ 5.",
    "46": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, was actually better than I thought it would be! I did come in with low expectations! Many fans of the Raiders series wondered will Woke Hollywood ruin another movie with forced awkward characters, and a disjoined preachy script which creates a collage of collective mush! Instead the last installment stayed true mostly to the 40's style action thriller. What worked: The start with a younger Jones with the action fight with the Nazi's over an artifact on a train is right out of the original Raiders movie. The middle works with an older Jones in the late 60's going threw the motions of acidemia only could be pulled off by a grouchy Harrison Ford. The bad guy who shares similarities to Wernher von Braun as a rocket scientist is a great bad guy. Smart as Jones, but has an evil similarity too Toht character of the original. Many little other formulated throw backs to the original is a nice with the film. The ending with the space time twist has a brilliant Quentin Tarantino style ending! What did not work: The Helena charter is the annoying person one asks is she going be at the party I hope not; But the Helena character helps push the story forward. The side kick kid is just as annoying like the screaming kid from temple of doom. The predictable chases, and the two weaker mentioned character mix into are story like cement causing story drag. Not perfect like the Original, but still hits the Raiders mark. 7 out of 10 stars.",
    "47": "Who would have ever guessed when the first Raiders was released 42 summers ago that a movie about a man with a bullwhip and fedora named \"Indiana Jones\" would become a blockbuster hit spawning one of the most beloved and longest running franchises in cinema history. I was in junior high when Raiders came out and am now just seven years away from being eligible for Social Security. I wanted to mention a bit of trivia. Back in 1989 when Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade came out Sean Connery was cast as his father and played him as a doddering helpless old man, Connery was only 59 at the time and Harrison Ford did this movie when he was 80 years old an amazing accomplishment by any standards.There has been so much written about the prologue to the film set during the waning days of World War II as Indiana Jones and his friend Basil infiltrate a Nazi train to try to get Archimedes \"dial of destiny\" that can allow one to travel through time. In those twenty minutes there is enough action for several movies and the CGI \"deaging\" is very effective. After the dynamite beginning the movie moves forward over twenty years in time. It is now 1969 and those years certainly haven't been kind to Jones. In the original he was a dashing professor/adventurer a combination of Clark Kent and Superman. Now he is an old broken man, the old grouch next door yelling at his neighbors to turn their music down while seasoning his coffee with whiskey as he mourns the breakup of his marriage and the death of his son in Vietnam (oh well \"Mutt\" was a pretty loathsome contemptable character that almost no one liked anyway and Shia Lebouef is a terrible actor). His students now doze through his lectures, after all who wants to hear about archeology in the age where men are landing on the moon. His colleagues throw him a retirement party where he is ushered out the door with his only reward being a cheap clock he gives to a homeless person.Poor Indiana Jones is past his \"sell by\" date and has become an anachronistic bore. This is technically a good and exciting movie but the original was shoulders above and not nearly as depressing. The writers of this film lean very heavily on the nostalgia factor rather then trying to be original for example we have Indy having a reunion with his old pal Salla who mourns the good old days of adventure they once shared only for Indy to say they are gone forever. Ford does get a chance to \"act\" more then in the other films especially the scene where he shares his grief over his son's death and his regrets of a somewhat misbegotten life in pursuit of treasures while not appreciating what really matters. There is a humerous reference to his fear of snakes of course (only in this case it involves giant eels that just look like snakes).Madds MIkkelsen is a fine actor who has the distinction now of playing Doctor Hannibal Lecter on the tv series, a villain in a Bond film and now a villain in an Indiana Jones films my what a distinction! He gives a great performance and reminds me a little of the Nazi Toht the character that Ronald Lacey played in the original Raiders. There is also a nod in the movie to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom featuring a street kid who reminds you of Short Round, only he is not likeable at all just a little punk who annoyed the hell out of me. English character actor Basil Jones does a delightfully hammy turn as Indy's sidekick during the opening.This is the first Indy movie where Spielberg is not in the director's chair but James Mangold does a good job filling his shoes. Mangold is actually an acclaimed director in his own right his most famous film was I Walk The Line About Johnny Cash. He also directed Stallone in Cop Land and Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in Knight and Day. He handles the action scenes with expert aplomb such as the horse and the subway scene.Phoebe Waller Bridge does a commendable job as Jones goddaughter and his companion on the adventure. My only complaint is she is somewhat of a immoral schemer and not very likeable. Many have commented about the ending of the movie being ridiculous as the Dial of Destiny malfunctions and sends Indy and the others back to 213 BC during the Siege of Rome. Oh well at least he got to meet his hero Archimedes. By the way, the whole audience in the theatre laughed when Bridge delivered that \"punch of love\" so Indy could go back to the present.The final part of the movie is the most touchng featuring a cameo by Karen Allen (a great actress who has never been given the credit she deserves) as Marion and Indy reunite and it seems there is hope for their future as in the twilight of their years they recreate a scene from the original that really warmed my nostalgic heart. For some reason the film closes on a bizarre closeup of Indy's hat! Its been a helluva ride Indiana Jones enjoy your afternoon naps and your golden years and may your demons be at rest.",
    "48": "Not as bad as people say. The action sequences go on for too long and the ending was too absurd for me, but all in all it was a solid action film.Synopsis:\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a 2023 American action adventure film directed by James Mangold, who co-wrote it with Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp. It is the sequel to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), as well as the fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones film series. Featuring Harrison Ford, John Rhys-Davies, and Karen Allen reprising their roles as Indiana Jones, Sallah, and Marion Ravenwood, respectively, new cast members include Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Antonio Banderas, Toby Jones, Boyd Holbrook, Ethann Isidore, and Mads Mikkelsen.

    "49": "At least I got 2+ hours of air conditioning. Indiana Jones starts off trying to get the lance of Longinus and turns out it's the \"dial of destiny\" created by Archimedes to travel through time portals.Uh-HuhFlash forward 30 years and now he's a retiring professor at a university where the student body is full of disinterested hippie losers, who most likely got in to dodge the Vietnam War. Does this ever play into Dr. Henry Jones' life. Nope. Other than to say Mutt died in the war, nothing is ever brought up again. In a movie this long, you would think a little twinge of disgust for these people would be a running gag. Specifically his estranged (?) god-daughter Helena played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She dresses and acts like him. You would think the powers that be would understand that perhaps she would have a moment where she wanted to be like Indy but turns out she was turned off by the result of globe-trotting for treasure. Instead, we discover she is a mercenary for fortune (and glory). Ugh. This movie stinks beyond words. Long gone is that twinkle in his eyes. He's addressed disrespectfully as \"Indy\" (you call him Dr. Jones, doll!) and now also has to tug around a street urchin Arab kid Teddy. Does this not look like \"Temple Of Doom\"They're racing to get this dial before Mads Mikkelson finds it...and wants to...um...kill Hitler? So he can take over and win the war. Again...ugh.Though the stakes are cleared here than \"...Crystal Skull\" the moments are so forced to really lazy effect. It feels like the gas in it deflated maybe 30 years ago. The charm smirk in the first three flicks is gone and we are left with a guy who drinks way too much and does so very little. The heavy lifting is given to Helena who seems to developed fight skills even henchmen would covet. Where would she learn that when her Pop was mousy Toby Jones? Give us a moment where we can believe she is tough. In \"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\" Marion does seem like a person who can handle a fistfight in her Nepal bar. She seems so painfully neutered when she returns at the end of this flick.The production design is outstanding but made ugly and cheap by awful digital cinematography. The glossiness of hard light played like a serial are exchanged for a more modern look. Discredit that to utilitarian Phaedon Papamichael who previously lensed better projects. It all just feels cheap.Incidentally, director James Mangold's big mouth fighting back against fans on social media does have credibility. His stance was watch the movie and THEN criticize. Well, sir, I paid and watched your garbage flick and you are a terrible filmmaker. Yeah, he owes the fans a massive apology.I await the day when he goes online and blames the think tank of Kathleen Kennedy, Spielberg and Lucas (especially this joyless hack) for this failure he dumped on paying audiences.",
    "50": "I'm a huge Indiana Jones fan and Harrison Ford is a legend. But this movie didn't do him or the franchise any Justice. The CGI was terrible, in true Disney fashion. I don't see how they can't figure it out. It seems to be a trend with Disney now. They keep pushing out tons of movies and the special effects continue to get worse. The storyline was lacking and it was entirely too long. This wasn't the Indiana Jones we all loved. I used to think Crystal Skull was the worst Indy movie but now I'm leaning towards this one. The last Indiana Jones in my book is The Last Crusade. You can't go wrong with Sean Connery as his dad. That's how I will remember Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.",
    "51": "Who was this film made for? Who wanted to see a depressed Indy hobbling around while a self righteous know it all spends the entire runtime reminding him how old he is? Was this film made for an audience of exclusively Kathleen Kennedy?And who decided to put Pheobe Waller Bridge in this movie? I genuinely feel like Disney is desperate for this girl to become a thing, but she is just unlikeable. And it doesn't help when you have her play an insufferable character who constantly makes 2023 comments in a movie set in the 60s, you may as well have told her to wink at the camera. I wanna say anyone else in the role couldve done a better job, but I'm not even sure about that. The character is just awful.Also how many times do I need to get excited for a villain played by Mads Mikkelson for him to be yet again wasted? I'm amazed he doesnt get sick of it himself. Dont bother with this one. Its not worth your time.",
    "52": "\"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" delivers a thrilling escapade that will satisfy fans of the legendary archaeologist while introducing some exciting new elements. Although it doesn't quite reach the heights of the original trilogy, the film manages to capture the essence of what makes Indiana Jones an enduring icon.Harrison Ford once again dons the fedora with charisma and gusto, effortlessly slipping back into the role that made him a cinematic legend. Indy's witty one-liners, daring stunts, and unrivaled passion for history remind us why he remains an iconic figure in the world of adventure cinema.The film's plot centers around the mysterious Dial of Destiny, a mythical artifact with the power to reveal hidden truths from ancient civilizations. This time, Indiana Jones finds himself racing against ruthless adversaries and deciphering cryptic clues to unlock the dial's secrets before they fall into the wrong hands. The story weaves a web of intrigue, unearthing long-lost secrets and uncharted territories that will keep audiences engrossed from start to finish.While the action sequences are well-executed and maintain the classic Indiana Jones charm, some scenes may feel familiar to long-time fans. The film occasionally relies on tried-and-tested tropes from the franchise, missing an opportunity to push the boundaries of the character's adventures. However, the nostalgic factor will undoubtedly please those seeking the familiar thrill of an Indiana Jones film.In \"Dial of Destiny,\" the supporting cast shines, adding depth and diversity to the story. A standout performance comes from a skilled and talented Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whose character brings a fresh perspective to the adventure and complements Indy's daring spirit.The movie's attention to historical detail is commendable, immersing audiences in various cultures and ancient civilizations. From sprawling temples to treacherous booby traps, the film beautifully captures the essence of these locations, offering a sense of authenticity to the breathtaking visuals.\"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" is an enjoyable film that will appease die-hard fans of the franchise looking for a taste of the iconic adventurer's escapades. However, it lacks the ingenuity and emotional depth that made the original trilogy stand out. While it's not a groundbreaking addition to the series, it still offers some entertaining moments and pays homage to the timeless hero that is Indiana Jones. If you're a fan of the character, you'll likely find enough to enjoy, but don't expect this adventure to leave a lasting impression.",
    "53": "As if it weren't bad enough that Disney stubbornly refuses to release any of the MCU TV shows on DVD/Blu-ray anywhere in the world, now they've made it personal by announcing they're discontinuing DVDs/Blu-rays of *anything* being released in my country (and ONLY my country), with their final release being GotG Vol. 3 (seriously, they couldn't have made it something I'd actually want to watch?). So, if I wanted to see this movie, my options were wait several years for it to be on TV (I could've been DEAD by then!) or go see it at the theatre. Normally I'd have gone on opening day, but wasn't able to. After that, I wasn't feeling overly motivated to and was just going to wait for it on DVD/Blu-ray...but thanks to Disney, I no longer had that option. There's been much debate over CGI de-aging of actors, but it was fine here with Harrison Ford's Indy in a longer-than-expected flashback. Obviously they felt the de-aging would hold up to scrutiny, and for the most part it does (there were only a couple of times it felt slightly off). Toby Jones plays Basil Shaw, another in an apparently long line of Indy offsiders (and kind of useless...until he finally isn't). What surprised me was how not-terribly-exciting I found the whole opening sequence. While there's thankfully no 'nuke the fridge' moment, it stretches credulity how Indy miraculously survives being thrown about and an explosion directly beneath him whilst his neck's in a noose.Sadly, things don't get interesting until a good way through the movie. Before that, we catch up with old man Indy, who yells at his noisy neighbours, baseball bat in hand (I can relate), and is unaware that the only person attending his classes who actually KNOWS ANYTHING is his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), wishing to pick up where her father left off in search of this film's MacGuffin, the Antikythera (designed by Archimedes). After she reintroduces herself to Indy, it's not long before she's leaving him behind at the mercy of bad guys. While there is some action involving a parade and Indy riding a horse, I personally felt things didn't really get going until the scene that begins at a Tangier hotel, where Helena's attempting to auction off the half of the Dial she nicked. Regarding their two characters, I did feel they had a decent dynamic going on between them and Helena/Waller-Bridge isn't nearly as annoying as Willie was in Temple of Doom. People like to exaggerate the 'feminism' stuff, but she's just as 'feisty' as Marion was and has her moments where she acknowledges she's said/done something wrong. One of very few 'emotional' moments in the movie is during a scene where she asks what Indy would do if he could go back in time (which turns out to be the Antikythera's power) and he talks about the death of his son, Mutt (as if you needed more reason to watch this film, Shia LaBeoufhead's irritating character from the last movie unceremoniously being killed offscreen should be motivation enough. No more crappy CGI vine-swinging alongside monkeys for him!).While the character of Teddy (this film's version of Short Round, who some people are making out Teddy can't hold a candle to...but I think they're forgetting just how thoroughly annoying that kid was and are only forgiving of him now because the actor who played him grew up to kick butt in Everything Everywhere All At Once and won an Oscar) isn't really necessary, at least he proves himself *useful* (just don't bother questioning how this thief can fly a plane with no prior experience) and doesn't YELL ALL HIS LINES like Short Round did. It's too bad Sallah wasn't the third member of the team instead (while it's good to see John Rhys-Davies return in the role, he's out of the movie pretty quick and only returns at the very end). Still, at least he doesn't feel as wasted as Antonio Banderas does playing yet another old friend of Indy's. What was the point of him exactly? Same can be said for Mason, the most unlikely FBI Agent to be working with German scientist/astrophysicist and \"former\" Nazi, Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen, who can basically play a villain in his sleep by this point). Rather than so many side characters, I think the movie would've been better to just focus on Indy and Helena's relationship, as it seems like we're only just getting a feel for them as a pair by the time the film reaches its conclusion.Speaking of...yes, there *is* time-travel involved (and yet it's still somehow easier to swallow than aliens). There have been eyeroll-worthy objections to Helena 'robbing Indy of his agency' in the scene where he just wishes to be left to die in the past (after actually meeting Archimedes himself), but Indy was being a stubborn fool who was risking screwing up reality, so her punching his lights out to get him back to his time was warranted. Likewise, people may be disappointed that the baddie doesn't suffer a horrific fate like main villains of the past films, but it's more about him realising how screwed his grand plan is (and, hey, if that isn't enough...we see his crispified corpse later). In the end, things are made 'right' again when Indy gets back together with Marion (complete with callback), after their marriage fell apart following Mutt's death. Anyone worrying about Helena taking over from Indy needn't get their panties in a bunch if the final shot of him snatching his iconic fedora off a clothesline is any indication. While this movie certainly doesn't reach the 'classic' status of Raiders or Last Crusade, the best praise I can give it is that at least it's not as ridiculous as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (which, much like the Star Wars prequels, it seems people are now pretending is some misunderstood masterpiece) or as gross as Temple of Doom. It's not 'bad'...just kinda boring.",
    "54": "This was such a fun ride compared to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Despite this being one of the longer Indiana Jones films, I actually found the pacing quite smooth, especially during the action sequences. The de-aging looked great and it was wonderful to see Harrison Ford back in the saddle. He was probably the best part about the movie, which is saying a lot considering John Williams comes back again to deliver a memorable score. I think some side characters are throw away, the villain is cartoony (yet Mads Mikelsen always remains fascinating as a villain), and the slower scenes tend to run long, but if you are a fan of Ford and this franchise, this is a much watch. Also, Mangold is no Spielberg (and he shouldn't have to copy him to receive praise!), but I thought those action scenes were well choreographed. Good work.",
    "55": "Entertaining conclusion (?) to the Indiana Jones film series!I was very pleased that the German actor Thomas KRETSCHMANN made a nice villain appearance. EUROPEAN FILM AWARD winner Mads MIKKELSEN shines as an ultra-nasty Wernher von Braun blend. Wonderfully old-fashioned adventure film that hops from Morocco to Greece to Sicily!After three weeks in theaters, the film grossed almost $300 million worldwide. That's probably far too little for the Hollywood major studio DISNEY, but my cinema was full. And the audience had a lot of fun. You can't expect more from summer popcorn cinema. Worth seeing!",
    "56": "Firstly I feel they've done well to capture the old feel of the Indy movies, something they missed with crystal skull. Perhaps because Shia LaBeouf isn't trying to steal every scene. I'm glad he's not in this one.People are too harsh on this film, remember nearly 40 years have passed since the original trilogy. I love seeing the old European towns, also feels a little more grounded in reality than the last installment. Harrison Ford isn't getting any younger and I'm glad they played him as age appropriate. I just wish we'd get more Indy films but sadly this could be the last for Harrison.I get nostalgic watching this film, a great and worthy finish to a great action adventure series. Something we don't get much anymore in modern cinema.",
    "57": "This movie is an insult to the paying audience and hopefully the last nail in Iger's and Kenndey's coffins. It is bad from start to end. Even the first part with a de-aged Harrison Ford are somewhat lame. We have all seen fights on trains in much better quality 15 years ago and the fact that it takes place during darkness in order to cover up atrocious CGI makes at even worse! Fleabag Waller-Bridge is the most despicable character they could have found! Annoying, unattractive and unfunny! Her sidekick is as bad and adds nothing to the bad plot which consists of plot holes and bad writing mixed with disrespect for legacy characters. My recommendation: avoid at Al costs!",
    "58": "Although I had many reservations about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as many Indy fans did, I have rewatched it twice since it came out for the first time 15 years ago and thought I would never say this but I like that film better than this one.The ending was horrible and it's obvious Spielberg was trying to recapture the nostalgic feel of his previous movies Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E. T. and blend them into the Indy franchise but aside from the awful ending beforehand it wasn't so bad.Spielberg had a good sense of pacing and it was never boring, even the end. It was stupid to be sure but not dull.Well just when you thought Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford were going to hang up Indy's whip for good 15 years ago apparently since Lucas sold his company to Disney they didn't feel that was enough and audiences wanted more Indy so here we have number 5.Spielberg was on board initially as was Lucas but both decided to only produce and hand over creative control to different writers and director James Mangold.At first I thought it could be better. I mean after all Spielberg and Lucas were both responsible for how ridiculous Crystal Skull was but seeing how number 5 turned out I now wish they had stayed on board.James Mangold may be a good director but he's no Spielberg and doesn't have his sense of wonder and adequate pacing that Spielberg and Lucas brought in one way or another to the first four films.To be sure there is some good stuff here. Even at 80 years old Harrison still plays an effective Indy. The actual story is clever and I like what they did with it and the ending is great and ought to satisfy any Indy fan.Yet even number 4 was better so the question is where did it all go wrong?I blame it on Disney for wanting to keep money grabbing Lucas' previous properties with Star Wars and now Indy. I can understand if they wanted one more to satisfy fans who disliked Crystal Skull but the finale should have been much better than this.And while Spielberg might have thought he was doing the right thing passing the directorial touch to Mangold, this franchise needs the Spielberg touch and magic that was in the other films and in many of his others.Mangold let's scenes go on way too long and up until about the last half hour it drags and drags and you keep thinking action will pick up and move along yet it doesn't.Spielberg and Lucas made Indiana Jones to be a non stop action franchise and when they were both in charge even if there wasn't action they had enough strong character development to not keep things boring.To differentiate himself from the original creators I think Mangold is trying to focus more on character development but unfortunately aside from the welcome return of Sallah and Marion the villains are not captivating enough nor are any of the other protagonists not something I can say about the previous four films.It's a nice effort but without Spielberg, Lucas, an effective screenplay and enough actions sequences with adequate pacing for me this goes down as the weakest of the franchise.It doesn't have enough compelling action or character chemistry as the others did.If you're a die hard Indy fan who can't miss this in theaters go for it, I guess some of it does work.But die hard Indy fan or not, I think you will get more enjoyment out of streaming this on Disney Plus in a few months.I think it's time Indy hangs up his whip and we give him a break. His first four adventures had enough excitement to offer this has very little in comparison.I know Ford obviously won't do anymore Indy flicks but if Disney is going to continue to do anything else with this franchise they have got to bring something fresher and more exciting to the table.",
    "59": "Indiana Jones and his estranged goddaughter, Helena Shaw, try to locate a device that could change the course of history before Jürgen Voller, a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist, can alter the outcome of World War II.James Mangold steps into some big shoes and delivers a poignant Indiana Jones journey set primarily in 1969. The set-ups never quite match the film's 1944 opening with its exhilarating set-pieces, but the stunts and staging remain engaging throughout notably the parade chase and under water search. The banter between characters, written by a handful of writers, is executed well. As well as chases, shootouts, fights and whip-action there's henchmen, drinking and supernatural high jinks, synonymous with the film adventures. The narrative welcomingly weaves in MacGuffins and supernatural elements like its predecessors, even if dropping a very lengthy mystical, fantasy based closing act.Dial of Destiny offers an emotional journey for Indiana Jones, and its poignant moments add depth and meaning to Harrison Ford's beloved character Henry Jones Jr. These character-driven elements contribute to the film's dramatic impact. The supporting cast, while many of the characters feel like extended cameos, are on form. Antonio Banderas leaves his trademark charm and intensity, and both John Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen lend weight to the overall narrative. Toby Jones is likable, and Boyd Holbrook leaves an impression, along with Mads Mikkelsen, who adds screen presence with a sense of intrigue and depth.While Dial of Destiny successfully delivers an entertaining adventure, it falls short in fully capitalizing on the nostalgia factor. There are missed opportunities to acknowledge or mention beloved characters like Short Round, Willie Scott, and Wu Han. Or draw dialogue comparisons of Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Shaw to Marion Ravenwood, or Ethann Isidore's Teddy Kumar character to Short Round. It lacks the same immersive quality found in the earlier Indiana Jones movies, and hazy background and lighting/CGI effects, like in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull's ending, are distractingly littered throughout. It maybe too late, unless Indiana is recast like James Bond or the technology is perfected, you can't help feel we need more live action adventures set in the late 1920s or 1930s.Despite these minor setbacks, Dial of Destiny remains a captivating adventure that showcases Harrison Ford's enduring portrayal of Indiana Jones, even if the tone is in the first two acts is quite grounded. That said, both Steven Spielberg, Philip Kaufman and George Lucas Indy DNA is present, cemented by John Williams fantastic score.Overall, Mangold's Dial of Destiny may not entirely capture the nostalgic magic of the first three, but it stands on its own as a commendable emotional addition to the beloved franchise.",
    "60": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, was actually better than I thought it would be! I did come in with low expectations! Many fans of the Raiders series wondered will Woke Hollywood ruin another movie with forced awkward characters, and a disjoined preachy script which creates a collage of collective mush! Instead the last installment stayed true mostly to the 40's style action thriller. What worked: The start with a younger Jones with the action fight with the Nazi's over an artifact on a train is right out of the original Raiders movie. The middle works with an older Jones in the late 60's going threw the motions of acidemia only could be pulled off by a grouchy Harrison Ford. The bad guy who shares similarities to Wernher von Braun as a rocket scientist is a great bad guy. Smart as Jones, but has an evil similarity too Toht character of the original. Many little other formulated throw backs to the original is a nice with the film. The ending with the space time twist has a brilliant Quentin Tarantino style ending! What did not work: The Helena charter is the annoying person one asks is she going be at the party I hope not; But the Helena character helps push the story forward. The side kick kid is just as annoying like the screaming kid from temple of doom. The predictable chases, and the two weaker mentioned character mix into are story like cement causing story drag. Not perfect like the Original, but still hits the Raiders mark. 7 out of 10 stars.",
    "61": "Who would have ever guessed when the first Raiders was released 42 summers ago that a movie about a man with a bullwhip and fedora named \"Indiana Jones\" would become a blockbuster hit spawning one of the most beloved and longest running franchises in cinema history. I was in junior high when Raiders came out and am now just seven years away from being eligible for Social Security. I wanted to mention a bit of trivia. Back in 1989 when Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade came out Sean Connery was cast as his father and played him as a doddering helpless old man, Connery was only 59 at the time and Harrison Ford did this movie when he was 80 years old an amazing accomplishment by any standards.There has been so much written about the prologue to the film set during the waning days of World War II as Indiana Jones and his friend Basil infiltrate a Nazi train to try to get Archimedes \"dial of destiny\" that can allow one to travel through time. In those twenty minutes there is enough action for several movies and the CGI \"deaging\" is very effective. After the dynamite beginning the movie moves forward over twenty years in time. It is now 1969 and those years certainly haven't been kind to Jones. In the original he was a dashing professor/adventurer a combination of Clark Kent and Superman. Now he is an old broken man, the old grouch next door yelling at his neighbors to turn their music down while seasoning his coffee with whiskey as he mourns the breakup of his marriage and the death of his son in Vietnam (oh well \"Mutt\" was a pretty loathsome contemptable character that almost no one liked anyway and Shia Lebouef is a terrible actor). His students now doze through his lectures, after all who wants to hear about archeology in the age where men are landing on the moon. His colleagues throw him a retirement party where he is ushered out the door with his only reward being a cheap clock he gives to a homeless person.Poor Indiana Jones is past his \"sell by\" date and has become an anachronistic bore. This is technically a good and exciting movie but the original was shoulders above and not nearly as depressing. The writers of this film lean very heavily on the nostalgia factor rather then trying to be original for example we have Indy having a reunion with his old pal Salla who mourns the good old days of adventure they once shared only for Indy to say they are gone forever. Ford does get a chance to \"act\" more then in the other films especially the scene where he shares his grief over his son's death and his regrets of a somewhat misbegotten life in pursuit of treasures while not appreciating what really matters. There is a humerous reference to his fear of snakes of course (only in this case it involves giant eels that just look like snakes).Madds MIkkelsen is a fine actor who has the distinction now of playing Doctor Hannibal Lecter on the tv series, a villain in a Bond film and now a villain in an Indiana Jones films my what a distinction! He gives a great performance and reminds me a little of the Nazi Toht the character that Ronald Lacey played in the original Raiders. There is also a nod in the movie to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom featuring a street kid who reminds you of Short Round, only he is not likeable at all just a little punk who annoyed the hell out of me. English character actor Basil Jones does a delightfully hammy turn as Indy's sidekick during the opening.This is the first Indy movie where Spielberg is not in the director's chair but James Mangold does a good job filling his shoes. Mangold is actually an acclaimed director in his own right his most famous film was I Walk The Line About Johnny Cash. He also directed Stallone in Cop Land and Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in Knight and Day. He handles the action scenes with expert aplomb such as the horse and the subway scene.Phoebe Waller Bridge does a commendable job as Jones goddaughter and his companion on the adventure. My only complaint is she is somewhat of a immoral schemer and not very likeable. Many have commented about the ending of the movie being ridiculous as the Dial of Destiny malfunctions and sends Indy and the others back to 213 BC during the Siege of Rome. Oh well at least he got to meet his hero Archimedes. By the way, the whole audience in the theatre laughed when Bridge delivered that \"punch of love\" so Indy could go back to the present.The final part of the movie is the most touchng featuring a cameo by Karen Allen (a great actress who has never been given the credit she deserves) as Marion and Indy reunite and it seems there is hope for their future as in the twilight of their years they recreate a scene from the original that really warmed my nostalgic heart. For some reason the film closes on a bizarre closeup of Indy's hat! Its been a helluva ride Indiana Jones enjoy your afternoon naps and your golden years and may your demons be at rest.",
    "62": "Not as bad as people say. The action sequences go on for too long and the ending was too absurd for me, but all in all it was a solid action film.Synopsis:\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a 2023 American action adventure film directed by James Mangold, who co-wrote it with Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and David Koepp. It is the sequel to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), as well as the fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones film series.

    "63": "At least I got 2+ hours of air conditioning. Indiana Jones starts off trying to get the lance of Longinus and turns out it's the \"dial of destiny\" created by Archimedes to travel through time portals.Uh-HuhFlash forward 30 years and now he's a retiring professor at a university where the student body is full of disinterested hippie losers, who most likely got in to dodge the Vietnam War. Does this ever play into Dr. Henry Jones' life. Nope. Other than to say Mutt died in the war, nothing is ever brought up again. In a movie this long, you would think a little twinge of disgust for these people would be a running gag. Specifically his estranged (?) god-daughter Helena played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She dresses and acts like him. You would think the powers that be would understand that perhaps she would have a moment where she wanted to be like Indy but turns out she was turned off by the result of globe-trotting for treasure. Instead, we discover she is a mercenary for fortune (and glory). Ugh. This movie stinks beyond words. Long gone is that twinkle in his eyes. He's addressed disrespectfully as \"Indy\" (you call him Dr. Jones, doll!) and now also has to tug around a street urchin Arab kid Teddy. Does this not look like \"Temple Of Doom\"They're racing to get this dial before Mads Mikkelson finds it...and wants to...um...kill Hitler? So he can take over and win the war. Again...ugh.Though the stakes are cleared here than \"...Crystal Skull\" the moments are so forced to really lazy effect. It feels like the gas in it deflated maybe 30 years ago. The charm smirk in the first three flicks is gone and we are left with a guy who drinks way too much and does so very little. The heavy lifting is given to Helena who seems to developed fight skills even henchmen would covet. Where would she learn that when her Pop was mousy Toby Jones? Give us a moment where we can believe she is tough. In \"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\" Marion does seem like a person who can handle a fistfight in her Nepal bar. She seems so painfully neutered when she returns at the end of this flick.The production design is outstanding but made ugly and cheap by awful digital cinematography. The glossiness of hard light played like a serial are exchanged for a more modern look. Discredit that to utilitarian Phaedon Papamichael who previously lensed better projects. It all just feels cheap.Incidentally, director James Mangold's big mouth fighting back against fans on social media does have credibility. His stance was watch the movie and THEN criticize. Well, sir, I paid and watched your garbage flick and you are a terrible filmmaker. Yeah, he owes the fans a massive apology.I await the day when he goes online and blames the think tank of Kathleen Kennedy, Spielberg and Lucas (especially this joyless hack) for this failure he dumped on paying audiences.",

I don't see how they can't figure it out. It seems to be a trend with Disney now. They keep pushing out tons of movies and the special effects continue to get worse. The storyline was lacking and it was entirely too long. This wasn't the Indiana Jones we all loved. I used to think Crystal Skull was the worst Indy movie but now I'm leaning towards this one. The last Indiana Jones in my book is The Last Crusade. You can't go wrong with Sean Connery as his dad. That's how I will remember Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.",
    "65": "Who was this film made for? Who wanted to see a depressed Indy hobbling around while a self righteous know it all spends the entire runtime reminding him how old he is? Was this film made for an audience of exclusively Kathleen Kennedy?And who decided to put Pheobe Waller Bridge in this movie? I genuinely feel like Disney is desperate for this girl to become a thing, but she is just unlikeable. And it doesn't help when you have her play an insufferable character who constantly makes 2023 comments in a movie set in the 60s, you may as well have told her to wink at the camera. I wanna say anyone else in the role couldve done a better job, but I'm not even sure about that. The character is just awful.Also how many times do I need to get excited for a villain played by Mads Mikkelson for him to be yet again wasted? I'm amazed he doesnt get sick of it himself. Dont bother with this one. Its not worth your time.",
    "66": "\"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" delivers a thrilling escapade that will satisfy fans of the legendary archaeologist while introducing some exciting new elements. Although it doesn't quite reach the heights of the original trilogy, the film manages to capture the essence of what makes Indiana Jones an enduring icon.Harrison Ford once again dons the fedora with charisma and gusto, effortlessly slipping back into the role that made him a cinematic legend. Indy's witty one-liners, daring stunts, and unrivaled passion for history remind us why he remains an iconic figure in the world of adventure cinema.The film's plot centers around the mysterious Dial of Destiny, a mythical artifact with the power to reveal hidden truths from ancient civilizations. This time, Indiana Jones finds himself racing against ruthless adversaries and deciphering cryptic clues to unlock the dial's secrets before they fall into the wrong hands. The story weaves a web of intrigue, unearthing long-lost secrets and uncharted territories that will keep audiences engrossed from start to finish.While the action sequences are well-executed and maintain the classic Indiana Jones charm, some scenes may feel familiar to long-time fans. The film occasionally relies on tried-and-tested tropes from the franchise, missing an opportunity to push the boundaries of the character's adventures. However, the nostalgic factor will undoubtedly please those seeking the familiar thrill of an Indiana Jones film.In \"Dial of Destiny,\" the supporting cast shines, adding depth and diversity to the story. A standout performance comes from a skilled and talented Phoebe Waller-Bridge, whose character brings a fresh perspective to the adventure and complements Indy's daring spirit.The movie's attention to historical detail is commendable, immersing audiences in various cultures and ancient civilizations. From sprawling temples to treacherous booby traps, the film beautifully captures the essence of these locations, offering a sense of authenticity to the breathtaking visuals.\"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" is an enjoyable film that will appease die-hard fans of the franchise looking for a taste of the iconic adventurer's escapades. However, it lacks the ingenuity and emotional depth that made the original trilogy stand out. While it's not a groundbreaking addition to the series, it still offers some entertaining moments and pays homage to the timeless hero that is Indiana Jones. If you're a fan of the character, you'll likely find enough to enjoy, but don't expect this adventure to leave a lasting impression.",
    "67": "As if it weren't bad enough that Disney stubbornly refuses to release any of the MCU TV shows on DVD/Blu-ray anywhere in the world, now they've made it personal by announcing they're discontinuing DVDs/Blu-rays of *anything* being released in my country (and ONLY my country), with their final release being GotG Vol. 3 (seriously, they couldn't have made it something I'd actually want to watch?). So, if I wanted to see this movie, my options were wait several years for it to be on TV (I could've been DEAD by then!) or go see it at the theatre. Normally I'd have gone on opening day, but wasn't able to. After that, I wasn't feeling overly motivated to and was just going to wait for it on DVD/Blu-ray...but thanks to Disney, I no longer had that option. There's been much debate over CGI de-aging of actors, but it was fine here with Harrison Ford's Indy in a longer-than-expected flashback. Obviously they felt the de-aging would hold up to scrutiny, and for the most part it does (there were only a couple of times it felt slightly off). Toby Jones plays Basil Shaw, another in an apparently long line of Indy offsiders (and kind of useless...until he finally isn't). What surprised me was how not-terribly-exciting I found the whole opening sequence. While there's thankfully no 'nuke the fridge' moment, it stretches credulity how Indy miraculously survives being thrown about and an explosion directly beneath him whilst his neck's in a noose.Sadly, things don't get interesting until a good way through the movie.

People like to exaggerate the 'feminism' stuff, but she's just as 'feisty' as Marion was and has her moments where she acknowledges she's said/done something wrong. One of very few 'emotional' moments in the movie is during a scene where she asks what Indy would do if he could go back in time (which turns out to be the Antikythera's power) and he talks about the death of his son, Mutt (as if you needed more reason to watch this film, Shia LaBeoufhead's irritating character from the last movie unceremoniously being killed offscreen should be motivation enough. No more crappy CGI vine-swinging alongside monkeys for him!).While the character of Teddy (this film's version of Short Round, who some people are making out Teddy can't hold a candle to...but I think they're forgetting just how thoroughly annoying that kid was and are only forgiving of him now because the actor who played him grew up to kick butt in Everything Everywhere All At Once and won an Oscar) isn't really necessary, at least he proves himself *useful* (just don't bother questioning how this thief can fly a plane with no prior experience) and doesn't YELL ALL HIS LINES like Short Round did. It's too bad Sallah wasn't the third member of the team instead (while it's good to see John Rhys-Davies return in the role, he's out of the movie pretty quick and only returns at the very end).

That's probably far too little for the Hollywood major studio DISNEY, but my cinema was full. And the audience had a lot of fun. You can't expect more from summer popcorn cinema. Worth seeing!",
    "70": "Firstly I feel they've done well to capture the old feel of the Indy movies, something they missed with crystal skull. Perhaps because Shia LaBeouf isn't trying to steal every scene. I'm glad he's not in this one.People are too harsh on this film, remember nearly 40 years have passed since the original trilogy. I love seeing the old European towns, also feels a little more grounded in reality than the last installment. Harrison Ford isn't getting any younger and I'm glad they played him as age appropriate. I just wish we'd get more Indy films but sadly this could be the last for Harrison.I get nostalgic watching this film, a great and worthy finish to a great action adventure series. Something we don't get much anymore in modern cinema.",
    "71": "This movie is an insult to the paying audience and hopefully the last nail in Iger's and Kenndey's coffins. It is bad from start to end. Even the first part with a de-aged Harrison Ford are somewhat lame. We have all seen fights on trains in much better quality 15 years ago and the fact that it takes place during darkness in order to cover up atrocious CGI makes at even worse! Fleabag Waller-Bridge is the most despicable character they could have found! Annoying, unattractive and unfunny! Her sidekick is as bad and adds nothing to the bad plot which consists of plot holes and bad writing mixed with disrespect for legacy characters. My recommendation: avoid at Al costs!",
    "72": "Although I had many reservations about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull as many Indy fans did, I have rewatched it twice since it came out for the first time 15 years ago and thought I would never say this but I like that film better than this one.The ending was horrible and it's obvious Spielberg was trying to recapture the nostalgic feel of his previous movies Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E. T. and blend them into the Indy franchise but aside from the awful ending beforehand it wasn't so bad.Spielberg had a good sense of pacing and it was never boring, even the end. It was stupid to be sure but not dull.Well just when you thought Spielberg, George Lucas and Harrison Ford were going to hang up Indy's whip for good 15 years ago apparently since Lucas sold his company to Disney they didn't feel that was enough and audiences wanted more Indy so here we have number 5.Spielberg was on board initially as was Lucas but both decided to only produce and hand over creative control to different writers and director James Mangold.At first I thought it could be better. I mean after all Spielberg and Lucas were both responsible for how ridiculous Crystal Skull was but seeing how number 5 turned out I now wish they had stayed on board.James Mangold may be a good director but he's no Spielberg and doesn't have his sense of wonder and adequate pacing that Spielberg and Lucas brought in one way or another to the first four films.To be sure there is some good stuff here. Even at 80 years old Harrison still plays an effective Indy. The actual story is clever and I like what they did with it and the ending is great and ought to satisfy any Indy fan.Yet even number 4 was better so the question is where did it all go wrong?I blame it on Disney for wanting to keep money grabbing Lucas' previous properties with Star Wars and now Indy. I can understand if they wanted one more to satisfy fans who disliked Crystal Skull but the finale should have been much better than this.And while Spielberg might have thought he was doing the right thing passing the directorial touch to Mangold, this franchise needs the Spielberg touch and magic that was in the other films and in many of his others.Mangold let's scenes go on way too long and up until about the last half hour it drags and drags and you keep thinking action will pick up and move along yet it doesn't.Spielberg and Lucas made Indiana Jones to be a non stop action franchise and when they were both in charge even if there wasn't action they had enough strong character development to not keep things boring.To differentiate himself from the original creators I think Mangold is trying to focus more on character development but unfortunately aside from the welcome return of Sallah and Marion the villains are not captivating enough nor are any of the other protagonists not something I can say about the previous four films.It's a nice effort but without Spielberg, Lucas, an effective screenplay and enough actions sequences with adequate pacing for me this goes down as the weakest of the franchise.It doesn't have enough compelling action or character chemistry as the others did.If you're a die hard Indy fan who can't miss this in theaters go for it, I guess some of it does work.But die hard Indy fan or not, I think you will get more enjoyment out of streaming this on Disney Plus in a few months.I think it's time Indy hangs up his whip and we give him a break. His first four adventures had enough excitement to offer this has very little in comparison.I know Ford obviously won't do anymore Indy flicks but if Disney is going to continue to do anything else with this franchise they have got to bring something fresher and more exciting to the table.",
    "73": "Indiana Jones and his estranged goddaughter, Helena Shaw, try to locate a device that could change the course of history before Jürgen Voller, a Nazi-turned-NASA scientist, can alter the outcome of World War II.James Mangold steps into some big shoes and delivers a poignant Indiana Jones journey set primarily in 1969. The set-ups never quite match the film's 1944 opening with its exhilarating set-pieces, but the stunts and staging remain engaging throughout notably the parade chase and under water search. The banter between characters, written by a handful of writers, is executed well. As well as chases, shootouts, fights and whip-action there's henchmen, drinking and supernatural high jinks, synonymous with the film adventures. The narrative welcomingly weaves in MacGuffins and supernatural elements like its predecessors, even if dropping a very lengthy mystical, fantasy based closing act.Dial of Destiny offers an emotional journey for Indiana Jones, and its poignant moments add depth and meaning to Harrison Ford's beloved character Henry Jones Jr. These character-driven elements contribute to the film's dramatic impact. The supporting cast, while many of the characters feel like extended cameos, are on form. Antonio Banderas leaves his trademark charm and intensity, and both John Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen lend weight to the overall narrative. Toby Jones is likable, and Boyd Holbrook leaves an impression, along with Mads Mikkelsen, who adds screen presence with a sense of intrigue and depth.While Dial of Destiny successfully delivers an entertaining adventure, it falls short in fully capitalizing on the nostalgia factor. There are missed opportunities to acknowledge or mention beloved characters like Short Round, Willie Scott, and Wu Han. Or draw dialogue comparisons of Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Shaw to Marion Ravenwood, or Ethann Isidore's Teddy Kumar character to Short Round. It lacks the same immersive quality found in the earlier Indiana Jones movies, and hazy background and lighting/CGI effects, like in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull's ending, are distractingly littered throughout. It maybe too late, unless Indiana is recast like James Bond or the technology is perfected, you can't help feel we need more live action adventures set in the late 1920s or 1930s.Despite these minor setbacks, Dial of Destiny remains a captivating adventure that showcases Harrison Ford's enduring portrayal of Indiana Jones, even if the tone is in the first two acts is quite grounded. That said, both Steven Spielberg, Philip Kaufman and George Lucas Indy DNA is present, cemented by John Williams fantastic score.Overall, Mangold's Dial of Destiny may not entirely capture the nostalgic magic of the first three, but it stands on its own as a commendable emotional addition to the beloved franchise.",
    "74": "It is 1944 and adventuring archaeologist Indiana Jones is in a familiar predicament: the Nazis have caught him attempting to scupper their nefarious plans. After breaking free of their vile clutches, Jones and his accomplice Basil Shaw discover the fascists have found the Antikythera mechanism, a device created by Archimedes that supposedly reveals time fissures. Jones escapes, foils the enemy's schemes and steals the mechanism- seemingly putting the matter to bed. Some 25 years later, however, Jones is thrust back into action when his goddaughter Helena comes looking for the Antikythera; with an underground group of die-hard Nazis on her tail. Will Jones and Helena manage to save the day before time runs out?Directed by James Mangold and written alongside Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and David Koepp, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' is an uneven sendoff to one of the greatest characters in film history, that all too often feels like it came from the 'paint by numbers' school of filmmaking. Mangold tries throughout to recapture the magic of the original trilogy of Jones pictures, and occasionally succeeds; such as in the thrilling opening set in 1944, or a touching reunion between Indy and his estranged love at the end of the film. Furthermore, it is consistently enjoyable watching Harrison Ford on screen as Indy once more, even if he is a more downcast fellow this time; and the odd reference to adventures past is sure to make fans of the series grin from ear to ear.However, the narrative is weak, the characterization of secondary characters is scant at best and- weirdly- at times it seems as if Indy is the sidekick in his own film. Helena Shaw, from the moment she comes on screen, is treated as the real star of the show, despite her being a decidedly unlikable lady. A spoiled and arrogant heiress, she is constantly rude and dismissive of Indy, when she isn't being reckless and impulsive, putting herself and others in danger for her own selfish motives. As written, the character has little to no respect for history or culture, seeing everything as a means to an end. She contrasts starkly with Indy, whose humble respect for his profession and legacy endears him to audiences. Helena, on the other hand, is a self-centered cad, who tries to upstage our hero at every turn. Why Mangold thought she should be made the (arguable) central character when this is Indy's last outing is beyond comprehension, not to mention being irritating and disrespectful to a cinematic legend.Alas, Mangold's poor characterization isn't confined to her alone. 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' not only provides us with a discount Short Round in the form of Helena's associate Teddy- a kid more irritating than mischievous- but a discount Major Toht too, in the form of Professor Voller- a Nazi scientist so generic even the incomparable Mads Mikkelsen can't make him interesting. Neither of these new iterations of old characters are very compelling, nor well rounded; and their inclusion in the film feels like a desperate attempt to out-do and re-create times gone by. Furthermore, the few familiar faces that occasionally pop up feel shoehorned into the plot, and Voller's troupe of henchmen are bland and forgettable.Unfortunately, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' contains underwhelming visuals as well, which look cheap compared to the likes of 'Raiders' or 'The Last Crusade.' Much like with the previous 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', there is a phony digital sheen to everything on screen that takes one out of the movie completely, and the questionable CGI is jarring throughout. Comparing the first three movies with the last two, it seems digital processes don't fit an Indiana Jones vehicle, they are the kind of epics that demand to be shot on film with practical effects. Moreover, the exaggerated effects and artificiality of proceedings hamper whatever realism Mangold was trying to foster with his downbeat narrative and allusions to real world history.The main problem with 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' though, is its lack of originality or charm, which the previous films- well, the first three, anyway- had in spades. Mangold seems content to rely on recycled tropes and clichés to forward the story, making this adventure feel like familiar ground instead of fresh fun. The film uses the similar formula of Nazis, ancient artifacts, exotic locations and supernatural elements that we have seen before, but without the wit, creativity and excitement that made them memorable; meaning this iteration of Indy comes as more of a whimper than a bang.Are there some elements deserving of praise in the film? Of course. Harrison Ford is consistently excellent and engaging as Indy, carrying the adventure squarely on his shoulders with his usual ease and charm. Furthermore, John Williams' epic score is stirring and- though her character is unlikable- Phoebe Waller-Bridge brings a nice blend of snark and enthusiasm to proceedings, sharing a good chemistry with Ford. Had they a better script to work with- and if Mangold's characterization wasn't so one-dimensional- they might have made a memorable duo. Additionally, the action is generally well realized- though tends towards the overblown- and there are moments and batches of dialogue that'll have fans of the series entertained, even if they are a bit few and far between.However, 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' just isn't great. As an adventure movie, it is too downbeat, and as a final entry in a fantastic series, it is too weak narratively to make much impact. Though it makes for a better overall package than 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,' it's not by much. The character of Helena Shaw is hard to warm to, the villains are forgettable and the visuals are underwhelming. In short, Indy, Ford and the fans deserved a better movie than 'The Dial of Destiny,' a muddled misadventure proving that time waits for no man; not even Indiana Jones.",
    "75": "I just got out of Indiana Jones & The Dial of DestinyThey have only gone and done it!! They have made a dull, boring Indiana Jones movie!! This is going to pain me to write.It started out great (the first 20 minutes or so) then it's just very meh as it really drags to its ending!! If you don't like what Mangold did to Logan in Logan, you won't like what he has done to Indiana Jones here. He is an old, grumpy; miserable, very depressed alcoholic, who bores his students to sleep and he has retirement forced on him.The chase sequences are clearly green screen and CGI and it really stands out!! It never feels real.Ford is game, and almost everything he does in this movie is believable. John Williams score is the best thing about this movie.Phoebe Waller Bridge is just one annoying woman, I never bought their relationship for one second, nothing feels real. None of her jokes landed and in the full movie, there was only one laugh in my screening and that was during a Raiders of The Lost Ark call back.Mads Mickelson is as reliable as ever. He always delivers, so no complaints here.It pains me to say, I'll probably never watch it again. Now it's time to drink away my disappointment.",
    "76": "The fifth & final instalment in the Indiana Jones franchise and also the first to not be helmed by Steven Spielberg, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny brings the famous archaeologist back for one final outing yet finishes as a bland & bloated blockbuster that fails to replicate the magic & bravado of its predecessors despite having all the necessary ingredients at its disposal.Co-written & directed by James Mangold (Logan & Ford v Ferrari), the film opens with a thrilling & action-packed prologue that brings the titular artefact into play but then it follows it up with a series of events that just unfold with a straightforward monotonousness. Despite being the final chapter, it doesn't have the urgency, even the exposition is lame, and the action set pieces lack flavour.What makes the ride dull is the same rinse-n-repeat approach that surface throughout the film in addition to it not having any genuine sense of danger or adventure or escalation. Humour is often poorly timed and the picture also fails to provide John Williams any moment to allow his music to soar. Harrison Ford manages to hold his own in spite of the frailty in his performance but the rest are forgettable.Overall, Indiana Jones & the Dial of Destiny begins on a promising note but gets bogged down by issues of its own makings. Most of the problems plaguing this latest sequel can be found in The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull too but even that disparaged entry employed better use of shots, cuts & outrageous set pieces. This one fares somewhat better as a whole but it is still a lifeless, overlong & mediocre offering.",
    "77": "Greetings again from the darkness. \"They look like snakes.\" It's such a simple line of dialogue, yet after 42 years and four previous movies, we know exactly what that means to retiring archaeology professor, Dr. Henry Jones, best known to all as the swashbuckling Indiana Jones. As the final chapter of the beloved franchise, this entry is the first one not directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg (listed here as an Executive Producer). Instead, James Mangold takes the reins, and also shares writing credit with his frequent collaborators Jez Butterworth and John Henry Butterworth, as well as \"Indiana Jones\" veteran David Koepp. Of course, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman receive credit for their original characters.Harrison Ford once again dons the familiar whip and hat, and at 80 years of age, still possesses the screen persona and magnetism that first won us over in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". The extended and frenetic opening sequence finds a young Indy (Ford is digitally de-aged for the sequence) at the tail end of WWII fighting Nazis over what else, a prized ancient artifact. I'll leave the specifics to those who watch the film, but just know that it's an interesting historical choice, and also one that matters little in relation to the enjoyment of the film.Working alongside Indy in the opening sequence is his pal and fellow archaeologist, Basil Shaw (talented character actor Toby Jones, who seems to be in most movies these days). However, the fun part for me is seeing Thomas Kretschmann and Mads Mikkelsen share scenes as Nazi Colonel Weber and Dr. Voller, respectively. These are two of my favorite actors and I do wish they had a couple more exchanges ... although Mikkelsen's character gets significant screen time and plays a crucial role in how the story unfolds and concludes (he is also digitally de-aged for the opening sequence).The story picks up with modern day Dr Voller and his band of misfits tracking down the relic and disturbing Dr. Jones' retirement party. It's at this point where Indy's Goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) pops up creating a three-way battle for the priceless relic. This sets off a chain of events that leads them on a global trek to desert, sea, and hallowed cities of antiquity. Helena's partner in crime is young Teddy (Ethann Isidore, sporting a Bob Griese Dolphins jersey), who is clearly the scrappiest of the bunch. Dr Voller's troupe includes Shaunetta Renee Wilson as the misguided Mason, Brad Holbrook as sleazy Klaber, and Olivier Richters as one of the largest bodyguards you've ever seen.Fans of the franchise know that the story is secondary to the characters and action, and there is no shortage of action on speeding trains, galloping horses, motorcycles, tuk tuks, vintage airplanes, and scuba dives. Antonio Banderas shows up as a boat-owning old friend of Indy, but it's the appearance of series favorites John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, and Karen Allen as Marion, that generated cheers from the audience. Ms. Waller-Bridge holds her own with screen legend Ford, and it will be interesting to see the career path she chooses after her success on TV and now film. At times this feels like a live action cartoon, and that's not meant as criticism. It's pure fun, fantasy, and adventure cloaked in nostalgia; and the film is a fitting conclusion to a world class franchise.Opens in theaters June 30, 2023.",
    "78": "I love Raiders of the Lost Ark from 1981, I like the second movie Temple of Doom from 1984, but I like the first movie more, I love the movie The Last Crusade from 1989 as much as the first movie, but I like it more than the second movie, and I thought the fourth movie Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from 2008 was mediocre, with the first three movies being better. The fifth and last movie Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was good and a good ending to the character, with it being better than the fourth movie, and little better than the second movie, but I still think the first and third movie is better.Despite his age, Harrison Ford is still great as Indiana Jones many years later; he is retiring from his job, and he is watching how the world changes around him since his younger years. Going on this last adventure to find something a friend of his was looking for, and to stop the villain from getting his hands on it, while also dealing with his goddaughter who wants it for her own reasons. I like how Indy is getting tired of doing what he is doing but also still has some love for adventure, he was also good in action scenes in the certain places they go to.Indy's goddaughter Helena played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge was not bad, I would have liked more done with her character by showing how she became the way she is, or how she could have learned certain things that are useful on the adventure, along with her sidekick named Teddy who was like Short Round from Temple of Doom. I liked the main villain Dr. Voller played by Mads Mikkelsen; his plan involving the Dial was interesting with his plans with the Nazis, and that he has a backstory involving an interaction with Indiana Jones; he was not much of an archaeologist, he knew and used math more to use in his plan that involves time.The opening involves a de-aged Harrison Ford that does look good, but sometimes the voice can sound older than he looked but also it would fit. The opening was great, it looked like the original movies and felt like them with a great action sequence that also sets up the main villain; all the action scenes are fun, nicely shot, suspenseful, and fast paced. Director James Mangold did a wonderful job giving this movie the same look and feel as the original movies directed by Steven Spielberg. The locations or caves they go through look cool, and interesting on how they tie to major points in history.The third act will divide some people, but because of other weird things that happen in the earlier movies, it was not that hard to believe; leading to an ending that is sweet and a nice end for the character. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023) was a nice ending that had callbacks to the earlier movies, great action, a fantastic musical score from John Williams, and Harrison Ford giving his all in his last movie as this famous character. This movie is not flawless, but I had fun with it, and I think fans will too.",
    "79": "With a heavy heart, I think I have to concede that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is not good. It's probably even bad, because even the parts that are sort of entertaining ultimately disappoint.Take for example the prologue with a de-aged Harrison Ford. The technology used to do it is impressive, and only looked awkward in a couple of shots for me. It's Indy adventuring during the end of World War II, and it almost captures the adventure/action you'd want. However, it's so dimly lit that barely anything can be seen. It's probably to disguise the de-aging, but it's disappointing. The stuff you can see isn't particularly great, but it fares better than the next couple of big action scenes.These are spaced out over the next 80 to 90 minutes. Said 80 to 90-minute stretch is honestly very boring. Harrison Ford is trying, and John Williams' score is pretty good. I usually like Phoebe Waller-Bridge, but her character didn't work for me. Barely any of the humor landed. The action is incredibly dull and quite often poorly shot. Ford himself isn't in much of the action, which is understandable, but it also begs the question of why they even bothered trying to make an action movie with an 80-year-old man.I swear characters enter a hotel at night, and they come out the front door five minutes later and it's the middle of the day. Why did they bring John Rhys-Davies back without giving him anything to do? Why was Antonio Banderas in this for like, five minutes? Why do they think audiences will care that Banderas and Toby Jones play \"friends\" of Indiana Jones, even if they've never been seen or mentioned before this film? Why does Hollywood keep wasting Mads Mikkelsen?The final half-hour is sort of fun, but it concludes very abruptly and awkwardly. Some people will hate where the movie goes regardless, but I thought it came close to giving the whole thing a pulse. The final scene itself sounds like it should work on paper, but it did nothing for me emotionally. As I walked home, I liked the movie less and less, the more I thought about it.It's so lifeless and uninspired, and even if maybe a third of it is passable, the rest is a combination of boring and baffling. Even if you're a big fan of the series, I wouldn't bother. This is a good deal worse than the other four.",
    "80": "In The Monkey's Paw (spoilers for a 100 years old horror classic, I guess), the protagonists, after the death of a loved one, use a cursed artifact to bring him back, only to find a shambling undead monstrosity knocking at their door.Being a movie nerd in these days is a similar experience: the franchises you loved as a kid keep coming back, and for a while, maybe after a decent trailer, you are happy and optimistic... but then you see them and regret their return.In fact, Hollywood just can't let a beloved series end at the right moment. Alien should have ended with Aliens, and it got a diarrhea of terrible sequels, prequels and spin-offs; Terminator with T2, and I've lost count of the reboots; Star Wars with Return of the Jedi, and it got the awful sequels (I'm giving the prequels a pass because they at least tried to tell an interesting story)...... and, of course, Indiana Jones should have ended with The Last Crusade. It would have been an amazing trilogy (I have my issues with Temple of Doom but oh boys, is it looking better in retrospect), and now it has not one but two pointless sequels.So, is this one better or worse than Skull? I'd say more or less on par: not terrible and unwatchable but clunky and mediocre.Ford was my favorite actor as a kid (\"Imagine being both Indy and Han Solo!\"), and he gives it all here, but the sad truth is, he was already too old in Skull, and that was 15 years ago.Mangold is a solid director but Indy movies live and die on the strength of their set-pieces, and he isn't prime Steven Spielberg. Then again, who is? Not even Spielberg himself nowadays, since the set-pieces in Skull already sucked.Mangold keeps the camera too close so we do not get the geography of the action; his set-pieces are all momentum and no triumphant release. See the scene with the underwater relic and the eels, a cool premise which peters out into nothing. Also, the protagonists (especially Indy) rarely if ever do anything COOL to resolve the action - a crack of the whip, a last-second dive: they are just there, ping-ponging between different obstacles.Story construction is bloated, with pointless characters (the governative agents, the Moroccan mobster), setups without payoffs (\"continental drift\") and endless tedious exposition: a scene with Waller-Bridge (moderately less annoying than I was expecting, but it was a low bar) smugly decrypting a tablet with a clue feels like the longest ten hours I've ever spent in a movie theater.Here's a hint, scriptwriters: characters dealing with treasure hunt clues is only interesting if we, the audience, can also SEE the clue and GUESS the possible answer. Otherwise, it's like watching someone on the bus mumble as he does his Sudoku, and you can't even peek over his shoulder.Dial of Destiny takes a weird turn in the last act and I sort of wish they had embraced the sheer cheesiness of it. I enjoyed a couple of scenes (the prologue is decent enough), but, if you absolutely need a good Indy sequel, play the old adventure game The Fate of Atlantis.5/10.",
    "81": "Indiana Jones movies were not always about the action or the grandeur, and they also showcased significant character dynamics, convincing comedic punches and, most importantly, the quirky, over-the-top nature imbued deeply in their expositions.All the things that this newer reboot/expansion has missed out on.Now, many might argue that modern-day filmmaking necessitates a modern-day approach and new-age sensibilities, and I could have agreed to that had it not been a part of a widely celebrated franchise!When you think of an expansion, taking the reins of a beloved series, you're obliged to give the audience a fan service. There's only so much room available for amendments. I like James Mangold as a director and adored some of his previous works (Logan, Ford vs. Ferrari). I do believe he's a capable filmmaker, but he hadn't done justice here.The kind of comedy that I treasured during my visits to the previous entries of the series was nowhere to be found. Phoebe Waller-Bridge seemed like a misfit in this universe, and as if that wasn't bad enough, the pacing was also horrendous. The 150 minutes of runtime occasionally wears you down; you would feel the stretch of time, and that's not a good indication.The only positives to take away from this film are the barrage of action blocks and Mr. Jones himself. I've always cheered for Mr. Ford in this character, and I genuinely believe he was born to play this role, and he does play it effortlessly every time. This was no exception. It's such a pleasure to watch him play this character.We will miss you, Indy!",
    "82": "It took me four separate viewings to get through this movie. It did get better, but its not a great movie by any means.The first 20 minutes are about as good as any other parts of the series. But then the next hour is grating. The dialogue is amateurish and the action scenes are so contrived its like they had several set pieces in mind and just needed to fill in gaps to get from one to the other. Lots has been written about the Helena character played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She annoyed me very much in the early parts of the film, which is why I kept turning it off. The last 45 minutes or so, her character tones down the annoyance factor and she's a decent addition. Had she played the character that way from the beginning, I think a lot of the hate would have been diffused. It wasn't a character arc. There was no situation that made her stop being annoying. She just stopped being annoying. Its like they wrote scenes for two separate characters, one who would be killed off, then changed their minds and combined the scenes/dialogue into one Helena character.During the iconic scenes of the red line crossing the map as they traveled the world, someone decided NOT to include the theme song. I mean, WTF!?Indiana Jones deserved a better send off than this. It wasn't terrible, maybe a bit too long and the direction was weak, but it still can't match the previous entries. It was missing the element of fun and adventure from previous entries and that is what really turned me off. It just didn't match the escapist tone of the earlier movies.",
    "83": "For diehard defenders of the entire INDIANA JONES franchise (not just those who feel that RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK stands alone since it was never called INDIANA JONES AND THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK), they'll throw the titular Ark of the Covenant coming alive with floating spirits whenever the later episodes go too far into the fantasy or, for the last two ventures, science-fiction and/or science-fantasy realm... but had RAIDERS ended up with Indy in Jerusalem B. C. or seated at The Last Supper for THE LAST CRUSADE, well, then...To give one small thing away with DIAL OF DESTINY would blow the entire cover, but basically new helmer James Mangold deliberately makes the Steven Spielberg action-directing-playbook a helluva lot noisier and way more needlessly violent: anyone helping-out the now extremely-aged and initially grouchy Jones will wind up quickly dead, making those random map-scattered characters not matter much beyond moving the bombastic adventure from one point to another -- in itself an important action-packed aspect which is often done decently enough...But the worst fan reviews have gone to the newest sidekick in Indiana's goddaughter played by the extremely tall and cocky Phoebe Waller-Bridge, actually more an attempted female version of the selfishly-driven RAIDERS French archeologist/middleman-heavy, Belloq, wanting fast cash for what's pricelessly meant as a museum artifact...Which is what Harrison Ford is at this point... an artifact... and the movie plays the old gruff sore-boned fella not only too much at times, but the randomly rejuvenated \"I've been doing this stuff all along\" hero doesn't seem very natural while, during various pockets of chase sequence escapades, the plot gets dizzy in a tiresome and complicated balancing act...Following the too-often-separated goals of Jones, the goddaughter Helena (with her own spry child sidekick, basically a sidekick's sidekick), and the central German Nazi, here played by Mads Mikkelsen, donning an omnipresent dull frown despite the usual Indy-villain obsession of obtaining the impossible by any means possible ie shadowing Jones since he always gets there first...Making DIAL ultimately feel more like a high-priced, multi-level video game (in particular the de-aged young Harrison Ford prologue) but that often feels maneuvered by a true franchise fan, trying their best to present a sky's-the-limit finale that ironically only works when it's not trying so hard to be... an INDIANA JONES movie.",

    "85": "I had a great time looking at this movie, until I started to think about it and what it meant. Here's 81-year-old Harrison Ford portraying 65-year-old Indiana Jones in feats of derring-do that would have put me in the hospital, if I was lucky, at 30. The movie was preceded by coming attractions of movies that feature 70-year-old Liam Neeson taking on a maniac who has planted bombs everywhere, and sixty-two year old Tom Cruise saving the world and his wife by running very fast and jumping a motorcycle off a cliff, even though the mission is impossible.I am old enough to remember when Clark Gable did his own stunts in THE MISFITS, and promptly died of a heart attack. He was fifty-nine when he died. It's certainly true that people can keep active and healthy and relatively youthful looking longer than they used to. Neither do I expect any sensible movie star to say \"Certainly I am fit and quite able to do this, but keep your tens of millions of dollars, Mr. Producer.\" Likewise, the movie industry hasn't come up with much in the way of fresh ideas since W. K. L. Dickson directed BLACKSMITH SCENE in 1893. Nor should they. Their job is to take hundreds of millions of dollars, shepherd them through the movie-making process like Oscar Meyer moving cow parts through the frankfurter-making process, and come out with something north of however much moolah went in. Since at least 1893, audiences have demonstrated time and again that originality serves little to no purpose in the effort. The wise producer has taken heed.And so, men -- and women, since Jane Fonda has been forced from retirement -- who should be spending their golden years enjoying their well-earned leisure, or engaging in roles that reflect the wisdom and dignity, and even problems that used to accrue to our elders to so do -- continue to pretend to run fast, get shot, and bounce back like rubber balls. And why do they do it? Because the producers keep offering them absurd sums of money. And the producers do that because we, the movie-going public, insist on it. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proven himself a smart and wise enough guy to get himself elected governor of California, and remains a voice of reason, passion, compassion, and love of democracy in our often fraught times. Yet he's still in demand in the movies, but only as a cigar-chomping tough guy toting a machine gun like it's a pea shooter and intoning \"I'll be back.\"He shouldn't have to. He only does it because many people, my age and younger, refuse to admit that we're getting older, and it's time to put away the juvenile fantasies that amused us when we were fourteen. Haven't we grown tired of sniggering at the same things over and over again? Haven't we grown up at all? Don't new problems and pleasures occupy us, or did we cease to grow more than half a century ago? Must the same people put on the same costumes and perform the same roles yet again, because we insist on being adolescents until they drag all our corpses from our Assisted Living facilities and dispose of the remains in whatever fashion is fashionable?No, this is a very enjoyable movie. But until we, the movie-watching public decide to grow up, neither will the movies.",
    "86": "I almost gave up all hope. Every action blockbuster nowadays are either defying gravity, mostly shot in front of a green screen or simply lacks an engaging plot. Maybe I'm getting too old. But 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' certainly made me feel young again.No, it is not as great as the first three of course, and yes, there is the occasional use of CGI, but seeing real people doing real stunts in real locations on the silver screen is what made me fall in love with action movies in the first place.What sticks out as a positive surprise is the production design. Case in point: There's an actionscene which takes place during a huge parade in New York. When they shot the scenes every store and facade were made to look like New York in 1969. Posters, merhandise, etc. You hardly see this in the movie, but the meticulous attention to detail is felt throughout the movie.I also really like the themes of this movie. A perfect fit for the swan song of the legend, Indiana Jones.",
    "87": "It's been 15 years since the last entry in this much loved franchise (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) was released and after the (putting it very kindly) mixed reception that film received you may have thought that would be the last time we would see Harrison Ford put on the fedora. You'd be wrong though as once Disney get their hands on a property they love to squeeze every penny out of it until it's run right into the ground. I'm sure Disney execs would argue you that this film gives the franchise another chance to end on a high, so the question is does it?Honestly?Not exactlyThe main plot of this film is centred around unsurprisingly The Dial of Destiny or it's proper name as it's referred to in the film the Antikythera (copied it from Google because I can't spell that). The Dial is an artefact that was created by Archimedes and is said to possess the power to let its owner travel through fissures in time (I had one of those on my a** once, it was painful 😬). This results in The Dial being sort after by three main people, Indy himself, A Nazi scientist (Mads Mikkelsen) and a student called Helena (Phoebe Waller- Bridge) who all have different intentions for what to do with it. From there the usual Indiana Jones action adventure ensues and firstly I have to say, it's at least better than the Crystal Skull which depending on who you talk to might mean very little.Firstly the positives, the main thing I felt this film did well being that it's confirmed to be the final Indiana Jones film is that it wraps up a lot of the loose ends, in particular it answered a lot of the questions I had after watching The Crystal Skull, so in a list of things you want in a concluding film of a franchise it gets a big tick in that box. Also, seeing Harrison Ford on the big screen is always an absolute joy, he's such an icon and just like all his roles he gives 100% percent in this one.I also felt John Williams score really stood out in this one, another cinema icon and you can't help but smile when a John Williams score plays and it brings back the memories of watching all those classic films for the first time. I also felt that overall as a film in itself it was an enjoyable big screen experience, certainly better than a large number of the films that have come out this year so far.Now for the not so great, most notably that while it's an enjoyable film on its own, other than the score it fails to capture the magic of the original trilogy. It's ultimately just not that memorable and I think that largely comes down to how great the original trilogy is and how great Steven Spielberg is a director, it's really difficult to replicate that kind of cinema magic again with a new director hence why I think the franchise should have stayed as a trilogy.I also felt the trailer which is everywhere and hard to avoid shows you too much of the film, there are even some cameos in the trailer which I would rather have been left as a nice surprise for when I saw the film. In fact most of the first half of the film is in the trailer, it's only really the last 30 mins that comes as any sort of surprise.This film ultimately isn't a bad film in itself but it fails to capture the magic of the original Indiana Jones trilogy and I don't think it's one I'll find myself revisiting all that often.",
    "88": "Mads Mikkelsen is simply outstanding in this film and frankly saves it from being a rather boring movie. He is electric and every moment he is on the screen he adds drama and power and momentum to the movie. Unfortunately, we have to endure the toxic and highly unpleasant Phoebe Waller-Bridge who gives strong women a bad name simply by being the female equivalent of the annoying Shia LeBeouf. I have no idea why the powers that be thought it was a good idea to hire someone so lacking in personality and audience appeal and one can only hope she has a bright career in script writing ahead. I found myself fast forwarding through her scenes just to avoid enduring her awful acting, mannerisms and obnoxious personality Overall, perhaps I should have rated this a 7 as I did get to the end of the movie. And kudos to Harrison Ford, of course I enjoyed all his scenes and the quintessential Indy bravado. Between Mads Mikkelsen and Harrison Ford (and a far too short appearance by Antonio Banderas) this is a movie worth watching. But please can writers/directors take heed and cast likeable characters - unlike the highly unpleasant and tiresome Waller-Bridge who I am confident has huge appeal for upper class Englishmen and women. But there's a whole world out there that really doesn't like obnoxious Margaret Thatchers types.",
    "89": "Poor, how many of us grew up loving Harrison Ford's Indie? The super cool action hero, brave and fearless, with a sense of humour... that wasn't the character I saw here.The first fifteen minutes or so, I loved, it felt like a scene from Temple of Doom, terrific, action packed, a heroic Indie, sadly the rest of the film very, very poor. I came away from the cinema feeling depressed, he's now a sad character, but fear not, Helena, the epitome of privilege will save the day.Horrible CGI effects, way too many, some of them looked awful, I can't believe some of the scenes made it through to the final cut.Ford put his usual effort in, how sad though that Indie ended this way, Disney you've well and truly done it again, that's another much loved franchise sent down the pan.I get the appeal of Fleabag, but Phoebe Waller Bridge was totally miscast, Helena was just loathsome, conceited, arrogant, too smarmy, what on Earth were they thinking?I'm genuinely stunned at how positive some of the reviews are for this movie, having recently watched Temple of Doom, and loving every minute, then watching this mess.....Sorry, I thought this was abysmal. It should have been a fun send off, instead is was just depressing.3/10.",
    "90": "Worth the ticket price, but still not up to Indiana Jones standards. Granted, this is a very high bar but this film doesn't seem to make much of an attempt to reach it.I frankly believe that Phoebe Waller-Bridge was the wrong actress for this part. Ms. Waller-Bridge simply cannot abandon the sarcastic, quirky characters she has played since forever. She's not dreadful here, but neither does she click like Karen Allen in Raiders or Kate Capshaw in Temple. I also believe that the development of the relationship between Helena and Indy is better suited as part of a post-Indy straight-to-streaming drama flick. It's just out of place here.Mads Mikkelsen is outstanding as a bad guy. The fact that his performance exceeds that of the leading man and leading lady is telling.I cannot be the only film lover who has noticed that the Disney Co. Has done little to improve the quality of Lucas content. It feels like the franchises born in the 1970's and 80's are now just being milked for revenues while the corporate office insures that it scores political popularity points. The quality of the art suffers when the art is no longer created for the art's sake.I do still think the movie is worth the ticket price but it really could have been so much better.",
    "91": "I want to live in a world where Indiana Jones is a trilogy and stopped with The Last Crusade.Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny has all the issues that have plagued other summer blockbusters this year. It is overly reliant on CGI and expects nostalgia to see it through.James Mangold is a competent director but he's no Spielberg. It's almost like he's read a guide to making an Indiana Jones movie and missed the mark. There is no heart to the movie which is the Spielberg spark it's missing.The CGI is horrific with the worst saved for Harrison Ford's face. The movie is like 90% CGI and may as well have been like animation at times. Past characters are written out in abhorrent fashion and threw away without a care.The last 30 minutes. Well...they nuked the fridge. (Bring back the aliens)",
    "92": "For likely no reason other than a quick cash grab, famed archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is on screen yet again to do what he usually does: track down a MacGuffin, in this instance being the Archimedes Dial, an invaluable artifact possessing Antikythera properties. In 1969, crotchety old Indy is beset with varying personal problems, but still attempting to educate a younger generation of students until he's needed for the latest search. Oh yeah, they threw in a goddaughter for Indy, presumably to raise the stakes. A bit of nostalgia early on, but really brings nothing to the table afterwards...Mangold has a proven track record as a director, but it's unclear what he's trying to accomplish here; there isn't an exceptional story, there's little to no excitement, there's not even a truly adventurous feel which was such a key component in all of the original films. Even at his advanced age an elder, quippy Ford is still quite engaging to watch, and there are some new characters, too bad they aren't interesting and exist only to service a manufactured plot. There's action, banter, globetrotting, nice scenery, some callbacks, and other stuff, but in terms of pure entertainment where's the true value in any of it? How's this for an idea: instead of dragging down established and iconic cinematic characters in a cynical attempt to try and score big bucks with contemporary audiences who weren't even alive when they originated, just make a new movie altogether. **",
    "93": "The much-anticipated latest installment in the Indiana Jones franchise left me with mixed feelings, leaning towards disappointment. As a long-time fan of the adventurous archaeologist, portrayed by the venerable Harrison Ford, I couldn't help but sense a certain staleness in the narrative and execution of the film. The playful charisma of the action is mismanaged, the discoveries of ah-ha moments are redirected to the lackluster costar, and scraps for Indy.The film attempts to recapture the magic of its predecessors, blending action, archaeology, and a hint of the supernatural. Harrison Ford, reprising his role as the iconic Indiana Jones, brings his signature charisma to the screen. His portrayal is still compelling, capturing the essence of the character that has become synonymous with daring adventures and narrow escapes.However, despite Ford's commendable performance, the plot feels like a hodgepodge of recycled elements from previous films.The introduction of new characters is an attempt to inject freshness into the story, but it falls short of making a significant impact. These characters lack the depth and complexity that made the original supporting cast memorable. The chemistry between Indy and his new companions feels forced, unbelievable, their motivations are thinly developed, making it challenging to invest emotionally in the new characters. Basically, over emphasized and exaggerated people we'd expect to be cast aside by any true to the character intelligent indy.One of the glaring issues with the film is its pacing. The action sequences, which were once a highlight of the franchise, now border on cliché. The film seems to rely too heavily on nostalgia, recreating iconic moments from earlier movies without adding any meaningful twists or enhancements. The result is a sense of déjà vu that diminishes the excitement and leaves the audience craving something truly innovative.Furthermore, the film struggles to find a balance between paying homage to the original trilogy and forging a new path. The nods to past adventures often come across as forced and disrupt the flow of the narrative. It feels as though the filmmakers were more focused on recreating the magic of the past than creating a compelling story for the present.Visually, the film is a mixed bag. While the cinematography captures the exotic locales and intense action sequences, the use of CGI at times feels jarring and out of place. The practical effects that were a hallmark of the earlier films are overshadowed by modern technology, robbing the movie of the tangible and gritty feel that defined the Indiana Jones aesthetic.In terms of the storyline, the mystical artifact at the center of the plot lacks the intrigue and mystique of previous MacGuffins. The quest for this object feels more like a checklist of Indiana Jones tropes than a genuine exploration into the unknown. The lack of a compelling antagonist further weakens the narrative, as the stakes never feel as high as they did in the earlier films.In conclusion, while it's always a challenge to meet the expectations set by classic franchises, the latest Indiana Jones installment falls short of the mark. Despite Harrison Ford's valiant effort to bring his iconic character to life once again, the film suffers from a lackluster plot, underdeveloped characters, and an overreliance on past successes. Die-hard fans may find moments of nostalgia, but overall, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the original trilogy timeless.",
    "94": "Director James Mangold has built an incredible reputation of his film quality with projects such as \"Logan\" \"Ford v. Ferrari\" and \"Walk the Line\" and even though this 5th Indiana Jones installment provides the ingredients to make fans of the franchise feel nostalgic, it doesn't live up to the standard that Mangold has worked so hard to develop. Harrison Ford shares his vintage stubbornness in a character that is seasoned physically yet equally charming, and complimented heavily by a dominant performance from Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The opening act teases the amount of green screen chase sequences that take place throughout various scenes, and that lack of plausibility slowly dulls what the film intends to provide as the most exciting, and attention-drawing moments of this experience. Dare I say hearing the score from John Williams was the most impressive element that stuck with me afterward, because it's the one piece that never alters from the puzzle. This is a fun family experience (though a bit more edgy) and a safe watch, however I can't help but question whether or not this deteriorates the classic nature of the franchise by reintroducing the lead character in a state completely opposite of what fans grew attached to.",
    "95": "'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' (or Indiana Jones 5) comes 42 years after the original, and while not in the same league as 'Raiders' or 'Last Crusade', it is up there with 'Temple of Doom'. This film is directed by Mangold ('Logan' and 'Ford v Ferrari'), who knows how to film a car/train chase. This time, it's 1969 and we have an older Indy (Ford) trying to find the eponymous \"dial\" (more like an ancient ballerina box) with his goddaughter, Helena (Waller-Bridge).She brings some good humour and a nice presence to balance Indy, as well as another pre-teen offsider, Teddy (Ididore), while Voller (Mikkelsen) and Klaber (Holbrook) are good as the modern-day Nazi bad guys. There's a few slow moments early on (aside from the opening train scene), but the film really hits it's stride in the 2nd & 3rd acts.As with most Indiana Jones films, you have to suspend a bit of disbelief, but the plot-point for the final act is pretty dumb. There's a few cameos, the iconic score from John Williams, some good wise-cracks and a mostly-satisfying ending. Mostly though, it feels comfortable and a mostly-exciting adventure film, as it should be.",
    "96": "Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, & Harrison Ford created an iconic Indiana Jones trilogy with Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, & Last Crusade. The idea was resurrected in 2008's Kingdom of the Crystal Skull--but sadly in an extremely unfulfilling way. Hence it taking 15 more years to give Indy, hat, and whip a better send-off--which Dial of Destiny most certainly is.For a very basic overview, Dial of Destiny tells the story of Indy (Ford) in the late-1960s. Now a retiring professor, Dr. Jones is goaded into one further adventure--this time with family friend Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge)--to find an antique dial that purports to alter the flow of time. As per the usual, the Nazis--this time embodied by former goose-stepper Dr. Voller (Mads Mikkelsen)--harbor similar intentions.Even though it might not be obvious all the time, Dial of Destiny actually gives Indy fans everything they might want out of a legacy finale. For example...-Digital de-aging of Ford gives viewers who missed the original trilogy's theatrical run a taste of what that must have been like.-Old friends Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) & Marion (Karen Allen) return in poignant roles.-There is action/adventure aplenty, as director James Mangold fills this flick to the brim with set pieces and chases of every kind.-All strains of John Williams' iconic score are present and accounted for.Add all this together and Dial of Destiny is a highly entertaining send-off for such an iconic celluloid hero.Now, is Dial of Destiny a perfect, all-time classic? Personally, I have it below Raiders and Last Crusade, but about on par with Temple of Doom (and light years ahead of Crystal Skull!). This one is heavy on the chase sequences (to the possible detriment of some character development) and the final 10-15 might be challenging to some. Not bad, per se, but just far different than anything expected.Overall, though, I had a fun time watching all two hours and 34 minutes of this Indy character finale. I'm a bit befuddled by the critical panning, as Dial of Destiny is certainly better than \"just okay\". In fact, I have a feeling that subsequent viewing might bump this film even higher. I certainly feel a lot better about the legacy of Indiana Jones (and all involved) than I did back in 2008.",
    "97": "Indiana Jones 5 sucked. It's not as offensive as the fourth one, but in a way...it's worse. Like how Disney Star Wars sequels are worse than the shockingly incoherent prequels. The opening scene is kinda cool and is the only part of the movie that feels like a classic Indiana Jones film. It might be worth it just to see the opening scene but that is about it.The biggest problem with the film is the co-star is so annoying and Indiana Jones becomes a second fiddle sidekick in his own movie - and he loses all of the spark that made him such an incredible hero in the first three films. This really should have had Shorty from Temple of Doom and it might have sucked less.Really, between aliens and time travel - I don't know how much more you can mess up a franchise that so beautifully made the ancient cultures of the world so mysterious and powerful - and they were truly the stars of the film.I'm glad Indy got one final film that isn't Crystal Skull, I'm just sorry that it had to be The Dial of Destiny.",
    "98": "No, it is not the best Indiana Jones movie. Yes, it is a bit too long. Yes, Ford is no longer in his thirties. No, the action sequences are not as thrilling as the mine-cart chase from Temple. This is all true, but isn't this to be expected?Raiders and Crusade are close to perfect films, and this installment certainly isn't. But when it's good it's very good, and the lesser parts don't go on too long. It makes for a very fun viewing, if you accept that things are never going to be exactly like in those 2 movies. It has some nostalgia, while acknowledging the age of the main protagonist and that things have changed. The story is far-fetched but grounded in reality just enough for you to suspend disbelief. The action is great to watch. It has heart. It's just...fun, a well-made film with some characters from way back in a new adventure. You know, like Temple and (to a certain extent) Crystal Skull. Or like most James Bond-movies.So if you approach it with that mindset, you're in for a fun ride. If you want a second Raiders, don't bother.",
    "99": "First of all the people saying it didn't need to be made, I will never understand why people can't just enjoy more movies on characters and themes they love. I feel like people always have this ridiculous level of expectations. It's Indiana Jones!!! It's adventure... It's action... suspense.... FUN! Remember when movies could just be fun without every part if it being ripped apart by couch critics??? That most likely have 0 creativity themselves. I really get disgusted by the fact that people can't just enjoy films for what they are. Entertainment. I thought this edition of Indiana Jones was exactly what I hoped for. Fun. Adventure. Nostalgia. Treasure. Borderline mystical. Great job to everyone involved making it. Now I hope they find a way to bring back a version of Indiana for future adventures. I don't care about people that complain about leaving alone what has been already done. I want more adventures. Much like James Bond, we can have more adventures even if it's not the same exact actor. Or create a new character to take up where Indy left off. Just lets have more adventures to remember.Just one real fan's opinion.",
    "100": "This movie was a clear departure from the magic that Lucas/Spielberg cast on all 4 movies, yes, even Kingdom! Since Disney took over LF, for this movie they simply hired writers that are clearly from a different generation than the ones that helmed the previous films. The writers for this movie mocked Indiana Jones, made him weak, and basically a carpet for other characters to walk all over him. Phoebe's character Helena was rude, sarcastic, and a feminist that did nothing but to further show how today's writers do not value characters such as Indy that was a strong leader that truly did things his way. The 21st century Short Round character Teddy Kumar was boring, dry, and another whipping boy for Helena to boss around.What they should have done was hire Lucas and Spielberg to direct/write the movie and even bring back Short Round to help Indy one last time to go on one last fortune and glory filled adventure. Disney as of late has truly been disrespectful to George Lucas and truly twisted the creative world he had with Star Wars and the Indiana Jones franchise. This movie was another sad reminder that today's writers are filled with an agenda to satisfy a small amount of people who will never watch or even talk about this film ever again after having watched it one time.",
    "101": "Indiana Jones Character is one of the Iconic Character ever made in the History. Harrison Ford played the character for over 4 Decade. And he still has fantastic screen presence at his 80's age. This is the 1st time James Mangold has directed an Indiana Jones movie. Previous Indiana Jones were made Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. Although James has directed for the first time, He still did a great job in Direction.This movie can't be compared with with 'Raiders' and the 'Last Crusade'. As per my point of view, Those two movies were masterpiece. But still 'Dial of Destiny' stands as its own because the story take place in Later age of Prof. Indiana Jones with changes in culture and Technology and his age. This is the first Indiana Jones movie which is longer in story line, locations where the story takes place and more action than any previous Indiana Jones movie ever made. This is the last movie that John Williams ever composed music.There are Few drawbacks;\n(1) You will miss Spielberg direction Style and Action sequence.(2) In the Climax sequence the story gets little carried away.(3) Few actors makes Cameo but very less impact in the story.Phoebe Waller Bridge is the new entry as character in Indiana Jones movie. And she really pulls off the character. Mads Mikkelsen as always f*ing great. He can act any character without agitation.Overall \"Dial of Destiny\" is a very well made action Adventure movie as per Indiana Jones franchise.It Deserves 8/10.",
    "102": "It just lacked that Stephen Spielberg fantasy magic dust that made all the previous Indiana films so magical. I did however still enjoy watching it (though I agree with one of the reviewers that it was overly long for what it offered up).It lacked good jokes and humour and the script was a little scrappy and unsure, in that you never get to know any in depth background on the Dial of Destiny itself. Explanations, in films of the last few years, have been very lacking and downright diabolical stupidity of the scriptwriters; and the directors. Ford does his best and holds the film together but other than the films opening 10 minutes or so, it lacks the usual slow build up of dastardly craziness, funny people, actions and events that we have become used to in the previous outing.As a huge fan of Indiana Jones I still enjoyed it well enough that I could watch it again but, to newer viewers It may be found to be wanting in large parts of the story.",

If you thought Crystal Skull went full Fast and Furious batsh-t crazy with the third act, just wait until you see the end of this one! I'll go see the movie again because I'm a Indy diehard, but unfortunately I'm not really looking forward to it. I didn't expect much out of this film with Disney being at the helm anyways.",

Nothing.In the first action sequence, he escapes. In the \"old days\" Indiana ran into danger. Now he rides away from it on a horse.For the rest of the movie he's basically being lead around by Helena, who is the main focus here. If you digitally removed Indiana from the movie, it'd basically be the same movie.I completely believe that the ending was changed, and that Helena was meant to be the hero going forward. Just another Kathy Kennedy surrogate. Yawn.",
    "105": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the final instalment of the franchise and a worthy conclusion for one of contemporary cinemas favourite characters.Does it live up to the expectations of the first three? No, but then again. No one was expecting it too.Did it surpass Kingdom of the Crystal Skull?Absolutely.Dial of Destiny\" faces the daunting task of living up to the legendary Indiana Jones trilogy, widely regarded as one of the greatest film series of all time.In its attempt to pay homage to its predecessors, the movie cleverly incorporates familiar elements like the ever-present Nazis, allowing Indy ample opportunity to unleash his trademark punches, and spine-chilling encounters with creepy-crawlies.While this nostalgic approach runs the risk of paling in comparison to the earlier films, director Mangold rises to the occasion, skillfully steering the action sequences with a refreshing and dynamic touch. His deep understanding of Indy's character is evident through the compelling character arc portrayed on screen, as well as a sprinkle of nihilism not dissimilar from what he did with Logan's character arch.Not to be overshadowed, John Williams' timeless score sweeps through the film with an air of grandeur, resonating with audiences from the first iconic notes. The music effortlessly transports viewers into the adventurous world of Indiana Jones, sending chills down their spines and setting the stage for a captivating journey.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny serves as a bittersweet but delightful swansong for Harrison Ford's iconic hero. While not without its flaws, the film embraces its imperfections and delivers an enjoyable experience that fans will appreciate. It often feels like a lovingly crafted \"greatest hits\" compilation, featuring familiar setpieces and relationships with a fresh twist. And you know what? That's perfectly fine.",

I decided it would be nice to see the movie with my wife so I went. I figured worse case would be I have a nice nap in the cool theater on a 105 degree day.The movie did started off with some CGI magic that usually puts me right to sleep, but this was pretty different and for the most part, kept my interest.The movie was built around a bunch of chase scenes that once again, usually put me to sleep, but they were short and to the point for which I was grateful.The story line is what held me and I found it intriguing. Let me put it this way: It was a million times better than the unmentionable piece of dung that was the previous installment.The movie was long, but it was very watchable and I did not take a restroom run even though I had to for the last hour.Harrison Ford's performance was much better than what I expected and the cliches were held to a manageable level.The rest of the cast did a solid job and there was no one who was annoying or took away from the movie in any way.Truth be told, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will see it again.",
    "107": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is another classic adventure with Harrison Ford's intrepid archeologist, but the movie shifts into a better gear when it reinvents rather than repeats. That said, nothing beats seeing this character back in the saddle, riding off into the sunset in search of the next great artifact.The movie opens in 1969 -- we've landed on the moon, but Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) has landed a job as a professor at a sleepy university in New York. The adventure begins when his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) offers him a chance to find a dial from ancient times that is rumored to have extraordinary capabilities. Indy soon discovers he's not the only one in search of the dial. A foe from Indy's past is on the trail with a posse of armed, dangerous associates and he wants to use the dial to rewind time and undo the events of World War II in the Nazi's favor. Indy and Helena's quest for a relic becomes a globe-trotting mission to stop the dial from being used for evil.It's a winning celebration of all things Indiana Jones, the character, Harrison Ford's performance, the movies, and a reminder of why we love them. When the movie turns its focus away from honoring the past and instead tells a whole new Indy adventure, that's where it gets really good. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny starts with a thud. We see a flashback featuring a digitally de-aged Harrison Ford as a younger Indy in his first brush with the titular Dial, aided by an anxious professor (Toby Jones). It sets up the fabric of the story ahead, but the de-aging effect doesn't work like it needs to. It immediately creates a distance between us and the adventurer we're here to see. It's disquieting to see Indiana Jones not as we've known him for five movies now, but as a manipulated, augmented version of himself. A large portion of the rest of the movie suffers from the same flaws -- in honoring the franchise's past it feels like it keeps doing things we've seen before. In the final stretch, though, it does something I've never seen these movies do before, more specifically, somewhere Indy has never ventured.There isn't a lesson per se to Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny but all stories that deal with time and its manipulation remind us that we have to try to be happy where we are, rather than live in the past. If you've seen an Indiana Jones movie, you know that faces can get melted off or hearts pulled out in the pursuit of treasure, be warned that there is frequent violence and some profanity.I give Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny swings into theaters nationwide on June 30, 2023. By Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!",
    "108": "The proper finale to a film series we grew up witth.Everything you would expect from an Indiana movie. Villains / archaeology / fun / action.The plot has a good flow with no holes and the supporting cast is excellent with Mads Mickelsen being as always great.It may have helped the fact that I went with low expectations but definitely a movie I would see again (unlike the previous one).It's not for all ages. We had in the theater younger people laughing or complaining which meant they certainly haven't seen any of the previous movies.Farewell Indy. It's been a hell of a ride since the 80s.",
    "109": "Like an obligatory visit to an old relation, it's nice to catch up but after a while, you're looking for an excuse to leave.The original Indiana Jones films had a wonderful sense of nostalgia for the old movies and tv shows Spielberg and Lucas grew up with. Whereas those ones were inspired by classic boys own adventure stories by the likes of Rider Haggard, this seem inspired by The Expendables and other trashy action pictures.This is a reasonably enjoyable film but the endless succession of fights, car chases, fights, fights and more fights just get tedious after a few hours. Ford and PWB are both excellent creating real people you can believe in but the story lacks soul. The relationship between them feels genuine and actually quite touching but there's far too much padding. It feels like they were given $300M and told to just spend it on whatever they could.It's certainly worth watching but it's disappointing.",
    "110": "An archeologist/adventurer who goes after religious artifacts.That was Indiana Jones.And it was a formula that could have easily had 20 films like Bond, with different actors taking up the helm as Indy - that we all argued over who was the best at it. Still going to this day.Instead, they stopped after Last Crusade - and that is why we get aliens and time travel cash grabs, 30 years later.Modern corporate America can't do anything great. They've proven it time and time, again. This was all inevitable.Instead of using their influence 30 years ago to become corporate America - the greats all bowed out; and allowed corporate America to be controlled by a bunch of factory line, unimaginative college kids.American exceptionalism is over. The college kids have clearly built a wall around their tower, where the truly creative need not knock.",
    "111": "Maybe the headline for this review is dramatic, but even without my high expectations for this film it still ended up being a little disappointing to me.By no means is this movie bad, but compared to its privious installments it's a huge step down in my opinion.But what did I like about this film? Ignoring the plot holes, the story was pretty decent. Action was fine, and Harrison Ford did a good job with his stunts (yes, Harrison Ford did his own stunts). Admittedly the stunts weren't as great compared to the other Indiana Jones' movies, but with his age can you blame him? He did the best and I think the results were fine.The characters were fine too I guess. Wombat was probably my least favorite character, but I assume she's supposed to be unlikable with how her whole character is selfish, which is something Indy acknowledges.If you didn't care for the supernatural aspects in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, you probably won't care for this film then. It's really hard to explain without going into spoilers, but the Dial itself does have some sort of supernatural powers that end up being the whole climax of this film. But at the end of the day it matter to me, and it shouldn't matter to you anyways when a movie like Temple of Doom introduced voodoo.I'd say my biggest complaint was how this film played it too safe, but other than that I'm not mad at its existence because it doesn't really change anything for existing. The film's fine, its re-watchable for the action, but maybe not so much it's story. It's entertaining when it has to be, an underwhelming yet decent conclusion, and that's pretty much it.",

It's not the years; it's the mileage - personified - with Ford giving his swan song as the titular, globe-trotting archaeologist with this rousing, rip-roaring return to form for the franchise as his retiring professor is reunited with his goddaughter (flinty & feisty Waller-Bridge giving as good as it gets) facing Nazis (them again!) when an ancient artifact is sought after by an old foe of Indy's (Mikkelsen dryly perfectly cast) which may change history as we know it. Set circa 1969 with set pieces and grand chases from WWII Europe to NYC to Sicily to Morocco and clever CGI de-aging for Ford in the opening salvo as well as some touchstones from the past (hello Sallah!) Kinetically directed by James Mangold (who co-scripted with Jez Butterworth, Joh-Henery Butterworth and David Koepp) the film slam bangs with precision and verve. Ford's iconic hero is given a shot of pathos, vulnerability, gravitas and finally, reverence which is all any one could want for in the long run.",

Let by Harrison Ford and a great supporting cast, Indy takes us on one last adventure and I just loved every minute of it and it's a shame it has to end.I really enjoyed the storyline and the cameos kept coming and Phoebe was a great foil for Indy throughout.Whether your a past fan or not, you have to watch it.I'll be back again and again for this one and I now feel like watching the whole series over again.Give 'em hell Indiana Jones, we still luv ya!",

She have all the good lines (or at least that was the writers intention).At the same time they have made Indiana Jones an old, depressed man that all through the movie is patronised by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She abuses Indy by hitting him, making fun of his ideas and knowledge, and even trying to kill him. Is that fun watching? Ni it's not, it's depressing and to be honest straight out insulting to the viewer and true Indy fan.So this 300 million mess is also boring. The action scenes are just CGI and is not taken seriously and therefore only becomes distractions of the story. And the story... it's even worse with logical gaps the size of Grand Canyon. But the writers don't care, they make a 12 year old fly a plane, and land it. That's the level of realism we get.So, please save your hard earned money and see the first movie instead.

    "119": "It's been 42 years since the release of \"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\" in 1981. Our world has changed quite a lot since then, but not enough to dismiss the vitality and charm of what is likely Indiana Jone's final adventure. And it's a worthy one at that!\"Dial of Destiny\" feels very much like a Spielberg/Lucas collaboration without the aforementioned genius duo at the helm. And perhaps this is the film's most redeeming charm: It has the look and excitement of the familiar globe-trotting universe we've come to expect for Indy and his legendary exploits. Yes, Indy is older, and far more physically and emotionally vulnerable than before. Perhaps this is art imitating life. And why not? Isn't that how life actually works?Don't let the nay-sayers dissuade you from screening this film. It's worth every dollar, and perhaps more, because it is likely the last time you'll see Harrison Ford portray this hugely iconic character.No spoilers here as usual, however, after viewing Dial of Destiny, Steven Spielberg quipped to the people seated next to him: \"Damn! I thought I was the only one who knew how to make one of these!\"",
    "120": "Disney and Kathleen Kennedy do it again totally mess up our childhood heroes. They turn a wonderful character into an old grumpy man.Being let around by a very annoying woman who knows everything,\nShe's constantly snatching the thread of a conversation away from Indy, constantly imposing herself in situations, when she's not on screen, we can take a deep breath because we feel so much better. Then it turns back to a Indy film.First film we had Marion, a tough woman who had charisma and not a know it all character. She was Indy's equal.Second film we had Willie, she didn't know how to fight didn't know how to shoot guns. She was out of her element, and she was fun.This film is way too long. It gets bogged down in many places. Way too much CGI as a very milky feel to it.I felt very depressed after watching this film. Indy's character of our childhood, has been destroyed by a company, known for making childhood memories.",
    "121": "Thank you for bringing Indy back-after the last one, I thought you buried him. As long as Harrison Ford is around, you can always bring up an Indiana Jones saga. I'll never say anything bad about Ford's performance as Jones. Honestly believe he should have at least been nominated for RAIDERS. He never fails to please and does so again here. But the story is uneven. Sometimes speeding manically along and then when it slows down--it stops. Bringing in Waller Bridge was a good idea to keep the story lively although I'm not convinced so much of her conversion from thief at the end. Maybe the next will push her back to the dark side and the emergence of a new \"indy junior\" would be a good thing. Mads is a good villian-you will really want to hate him at one point. Unfortunately, Teddy is no Short-Round. He lacks the likeability and thats a hole in this story: he's not charismatic nor is he really likeable so you almost don't care what happens to him other than he is integral to saving Indy and Wombat towards the end. Indiana Jones is a character that really shouldn't die: he is the 1930s version of Luke Skywalker: to make him go away will almost be unAmerican, but we need to get to another hero and the next jones should be the bridge that this one wasn't. Still - I would rather pay money to see this flawed jones than pay money to see half the films that are also coming out this year.",
    "122": "Disney gets hold of the Indiana Jones franchise, and suddenly you have a Karine Jean-Pierre lookalike, globally round afro and all, doing double-duty as a CIA agent. However, apart from that lame attempt at political-correctness, Disney just let general silliness, plot holes, and questionable cast selections round out the rest of the movie. However, for all Disney's best efforts to ruin yet another film icon, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny turned out to be an enjoyable movie.I just saw the film this afternoon, so have had little time to reflect on it, but overall enjoyed myself. The first 20 minutes, with the de-aged Harrison Ford, were a lot of fun ... very much like old times. The middle part of the movie dragged somewhat, but it did all rise to a very nice climax. The post climax final scene was touching in a strange way ... no spoilers here though.The cast of the movie were good to merely OK. Harrison Ford was his usual brilliant self, playing a character he has owned for over 4 decades. However, I did not find Phoebe Waller-Bridge either likeable enough, nor a strong enough actor, to carry off the amount of screen time she was given. Mads Mikkelson played his usual very solid villain, a role he seems to have turned into a very nice career. Need a villain? Get Mads! However, the \"kid\" ... it seems every Indy movie has to have a kid ... played by Ethann Isidore, didn't seem to have a clue how to act in front of a camera. Maybe it was simply the fact that the role of \"the kid\" just seemed to be shoe-horned into the story line for no apparent reason whatsoever. Who was he? Where did he come from? And most of all, why did he have to be there?Overall, though, I'd give the movie the proverbial thumbs up, maybe simply because I'm a die-hard fan of the franchise, and saw the first instalment in the theatre way back in 1981. Maybe I just needed another chance to go see Indy one last time.",
    "123": "Delighted to see Indy on the big screen again and have the chance to take my kids to see such an iconic legend. It's great fun. A bit long, maybe scary for kids in places (but exactly what you want from an Indiana Jones movie!) and IMO ending pays off with a big surprise. (Go see it before someone who doesn't like it ruins it for you!)The movie starts off great. There's a bit of uncanny valley with the de-aging, but the scene itself is so much fun and classic Indy back fighting Nazi's and you know it's Harrison Ford for real, which makes it so much more powerful.Once we jump forward we see an older Indy now forced to face the new age of the moon landing and space fanatics. He's tired, grumpy and fed-up with life. What's there to live for? Well thank God there's another adventure around the corner waiting for him! Phoebe waller-bridge is the new sidekick for Indy who sets everything in motion. No one is ever going to beat Sean Connery in that role, but Phoebe does her best and you believe their relationship for the most part. It's not perfect, their banter isn't hilariously funny and emotional, but it does not ruin the movie, and Phoebe is a perfectly well equipped actor to keep up with Harrison and join in on the action. (Ignore the haters. She is not as annoying or over bearing as they make out.)The new bad guys led by Casino Royal's Mads Mikkelsen and ruthless henchman Boyd Holbrook from Logan, are ferocious brutal killers, in the most horrible sense. They shoot innocent people in cold blood too often for my liking in a family adventure movie, but are worthy foes for Indy to battle against, and you do find yourself on the edge of your seat when Indy is on the run from them or fighting them.This is where some people may have gripes with the film, which is Indy can't physically take them on, due to his age, so just runs away instead or chases them in a car, but then he's no problem jumping from cars to horses to gain the upper hand, which is fine, Harrison is magnificent, but if we're going to play the age card, I'd like to see Indy outwit the bad guys too with his book-smarts & experience, trapping the bad guys in a cave full of skeletons or spiders, if even just to slow them down, without changing the overall outcome.Nonetheless, Indy's last action adventure is a whip roaring one from start to finish. It's incredible to see Harrison donning the famous fedora again, taking on Nazi's and exploring creepy caves and getting himself in way over his head, as always! It's not Raiders or Last Crusade. Definitely not Kingdom. Just a great mad new adventure. To be enjoyed on the big screen with the amazing John William's score that's guaranteed to get you in the mood for another spine tingling adventure.",
    "124": "Disney is becoming more and more synonymous with disaster and desperation. This movie gets a 10 on both these measures. A complete and utter disaster and desperately poor on any measure.The film is a series of geriatric movie \"chase scenes\" with no originality, defined purpose or any reason to merit interest, from the viewer.Harrison Ford is his usual self, only he is now old and tired. It is just another movie where Harrison Ford is once again, Harrison Ford, but, this time, reading lines from a completely unoriginal and banal script.There is no meaningful story line, original or inspiring script to support his complete lack of the remotest semblance of any acting skills.To top it off the leading \"actress\" role is played by an equally talentless British \"comedienne\" who contributes nothing but pure ham to this movie salad.The movie is only successful in so far as, it has completely destroyed the Indiana jones franchise and any hope of a sequel.RIP Indiana Jones.",

It keeps you engaged the entire time and takes you back to the good old days when Raiders first came out. It's a definite return to form after some very average films in the series.The technology is clever and used superbly. It's wonderful to see some of the old cast members again plus a few new stars. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is wonderful with the right mix of comedy and drama. There was a great rapport between the two lead characters.They wrapped up the series beautifully. It's fascinating that the storyline has an element of truth in that the focus of the movie actually exists and is one of the great mysteries.People can be overly critical but I went along for the ride and loved it. It made me remember how much I loved the first in the series. The entire cast did a great job. It's not Citizen Kane but it's a highly entertaining, rewarding final episode.",

    "127": "I'm at a loss. I thought Indiana Jones was about an adventuring archeologist hunting ancient religious artifacts to be preserved in museums. And the first 20 minutes confirm that sentiment.And to be fair, John Williams' fantastic score reminds me that I did walk into the right showing. But instead of a rousing epic, I witnessed a strange concoction of overblown ideas, baffling casting choices, plot conveniences, bad dialogue, and some of the worst written characters I can remember. Especially Helena, who's played by a talented PWB but is written to be an insufferable, pedantic braggart.There's a strange veneer that makes everything resemble something familiar. But it all feels off. Even the deepfakery produced some chuckles in the theatre.There's some fun scenes and cameos and I enjoyed the villain. But calling this an Indiana Jones movie? Maybe Illinois Jones.",
    "128": "Modern blockbusters undoubtedly owe plenty of gratitude to Steven Spielberg's first three Indiana Jones films, particularly \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" They helped serve as a prototype for future blockbusters, blending action set pieces with a compelling lead hero, swagger, and a ton of fun. While they sometimes feel very much (often in a good way) of a product of their generation, they still are far more well-made and entertaining than the overwhelming majority of blockbuster sequels today. Unfortunately, the fourth film in the series, \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\" was rather unsatisfying. Fortunately, this final adventure for Harrison Ford mostly learns from the mistakes of that film, and while it's definitely not on the level of the first two and arguably the third film (how could it be?) it still is an incredibly fun and enjoyable adventure for fans of the series.After a riveting and action-packed prologue, this film is set in 1969 and concerns Indiana Jones' life as a professor. He's increasingly concerned that NASA is willing to hire former Nazis to advise them on aerospace matters. He partners up with his goddaughter Helena to help find a dial that has time travel powers, and prevent it from being placed into the hands of the former Nazis. The plot of \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" is not exactly the most original, but even though Spielberg did not direct this installment, the unique trademarks of his films still come out in full force. There's whip-smart pacing and editing, clever line delivery, and an earnest emotional core between Indiana Jones and the people close to him. Despite being dramatically different tonally from James Mangold's earlier blockbuster \"Logan,\" this film actually shares a common theme about what it's like to be a hero looking into a rapidly changing world and worrying about being considered past his prime. The film's action setpieces are well-choreographed, thrilling, and engaging. They provide a sense of excitement and fun, but Mangold wisely makes sure they are never overbearing in relation to establishing a compelling and clever story. This storytelling is accentuated by strong performances. Despite his age (now 80,) Harrison Ford is just as charismatic and provides just a strong performance as Indy as ever. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is also very good as Helena, and Mads Mikkelsen is a creepily effective Nazi. The blend of action, humor, and dramatic stakes is thoroughly balanced over the 2.5 hour runtime, making the film thoroughly entertaining and never feeling tedious or overlong. A great score (John Williams is truly a legend!) and splendid period design of both late-1960s New York City and international locations help make the film more impactful and engaging. While not perfect, this is a highly entertaining blockbuster for those who love this franchise, and I believe that Spielberg would generally be proud of this installment. But above all, it's a great send-off to Harrison Ford in one of his most iconic roles, and a true blast of joy for fans of him as an actor to see him play Indy one last time. Gladly recommended. 7.5/10My ranking of the franchise is: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, Last Crusade/Dial of Destiny (tie,) Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.",
    "129": "It's been a long time since I first got myself a pirate VHS copy of The kingdom of the crystal skull and sank into it. Ever since childhood Indiana Jones was one of my favorite characters, the sole reason I became interested in archeology and everything ancient and Harrison Ford was there to guide me in my passion for history. The first three movies were masterpieces of entertainment hands down, the fourth was, well, a different, almost an alien piece of work but it was driven by the energy of father and son relationship hence it was also a good fun movie.As I sat and watched The dial of destiny I felt the movie's alien nature once again only this time it was in a bad way. Don't get me wrong it's filled with action to the brim, so much so that if you blink you'll miss some fantastic eye-dropping shot but all in all it is a bland uninspired body of work written by four people and none of them was George Lucas or Steven Spielberg.The dial of destiny could have easily been a different movie if it hadn't had Indiana Jones before it and that name alone should put a stamp of high quality on it which there wasn't. The characters are dumb and have no motivation, no stamina, no nothing to hold onto; the villains are your usual goonies with half a brain and even Mads Mikkelsen wasn't able to bring life to his just another ex-Nazi character with God's syndrome.Harrison Ford himself is old and tired as his character who should have been retired many years ago; he clearly didn't want to be Indiana Jones anymore, as much as Han Solo and he shows it in every frame with his wooden acting and one facial expression.Yes, they added a tea spoon of drama to Indiana but forgot to pour tea first which in the end turned out to be a sugary sweet version of a farewell party for Jones and Co. The adventure is mind-blowing though and the scene in Syracuse is absolutely the best part of the whole movie but overall The dial of destiny is pretty forgettable and it is an unnecessary addition to the world of the greatest archeologist with a whip and a hat but I nevertheless am glad this movie happened - to prove once again that Hollywood can never make a worthy continuation of an iconic movie.",
    "130": "I've just left the cinema feeling slightly underwhelmed, and very confused.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny feels in many ways, like an old Indiana movie.It's wonderful to see Harrison Ford back in his best role, even if he does look far too old to be undertaking even half the things in the film.There's some solid nostalgia and references to the old films, with a few old characters popping up, and our new characters actually did a pretty good job. Mads Mikklesen, is an ok villain, if not very shallow, but personally the star is Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who shines throughout giving us constant jokes with a cheeky smile.The score was brilliant as to be expected, which accompanies car chases, ancient ruins, action scenes and all the rest. The humour is on point, it's never boring, and everything moves at a very steady pace.The first 3/4 of the movie are pretty great, and at this point I would have probably given it a 7/7.5 out of 10.But... the ending of the film is just confusing, and very underwhelming. I won't obviously give anything away, but my wife and I both said we'd really appreciate a 20 minute YouTube video explaining what on earth happened, and how did they get there?It's worth a trip to the cinema, and great to see Indiana back on our screens one final time, but it will leave you feeling rather empty inside. 6.5 / 10.",
    "131": "Went into this with pretty low expectations, which at least partly explains why I thought it was quite ok.Of course it had its share of problems. Started out with a digitally enhanced Indy taking on some nazis. Thought the cgi was pretty solid, although the lighting was deliberately low so it was harder to notice the flaws that were still there.The action scenes were fast paced in vintage Indiana Jones fashion. Harrison Ford weren't in most of them, which is understandable but still a shame. Speaking of Ford, at 80 he is still a forceful presence in every scene he's in. A true actor too rarely found these days.As fast paced as the action was, I still got the feeling I was watching a video game large portions of the film.Indys goddaughter sidekick was easily the worst thing about the entire movie. Totally annoying, none of the jokes landed and there was zero chemistry between her and Ford.Mads Mikkelsen was dependable as the adversary.It was good to see Jonathan Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen in a reunion of sorts. Still thought that the ending felt a bit cramped. Could have been done better, but this was ok. Maybe not price of admission ok, but a decent ride into the sunset.",
    "132": "As a die hard Indiana Jones fan, it was worth a watch and it was pretty fun and entertaining in most parts. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, sure did added a lot of action, and has heart, and also some good classic vibe moments and pretty a little bit of humor, but there are some moments that went pretty shaky and some pretty much funny looking poor CGI effects!I would prefer 3 original Indiana Jones movies along with legendary Harrison Ford who did a really great job playing his legendary Indiana Jones as always, view years later. And Steven Spielberg was an incredible filmmaker, without a doubt. And legendary John Williams with his score was beautiful well done and brings so many good score vibes with his best theme music composing skills that would reveal his music identity!Harrison Ford is at his best as Indiana Jones, and Mads Mikkelsen also did a good job playing the villain, also have to give credits to Karen Allen, Antonio Banderas, and John Rhys-Davies, they did a really good job with there performances, but Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for me on the other hand, I think she ruined the whole movie with her character and other new characters that I do not find entertaining or interesting.I gotta admit, James Mangold who made \"Logan\", \"Ford v Ferrari\", and \"the Wolverine\" did a pretty good job directing it, but Kathleen Kennedy on the other hand, I never trusted her for what she has done over the years, sense she likes to ruin Star Wars and Lucasfilm view years back ever sense! Like she ruined \"The Last Jedi\" and \"The Rise of Skywalker\" those were so incredibly bad! So I despise her for ruining Lucasfilm and I really hope she retires or get fired from Hollywood for good!But like I said, it was worth a watch. So I just wanted to say congratulations to Harrison Ford, Steven Spielberg, and John Williams for bringing the best moments that was so magical and enjoyable for me. The Adventure... never dies!6/10.",
    "133": "When the Dial of Destiny came out I read lots of negative comments also when a movie comes out I always check the box office openings and when I saw it ended up flopping I thought ok, they finally messed up a good thing too and I refused to go and see it in the movie theatre because I'm an Indiana Jones fan and I love the franchise. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a movie that I visit time to time and still enjoy watching it. Part of the reason is I didn't want to ruin the love and respect that I got for IJ franchise If the this last IJ movie did actually disrespect the franchise. Of Course, I knew I would watch it when it is on Demand. It has been a while since it came out and finally yesterday I watched it at home and I don't understand what's wrong with those people? They have been bashing the movie so hard even the fans got affected by them and for what?I think the movie is made more believable in many senses. An almost 80 years old Indiana acts like an old man who had his time and adventures in his prime. I don't see any problems in that. I would feel like cheated if Indiana moves and fights like he is in his 40s so at hos 80s he acts like he is an old man who still got spark in him. The movie also got all the classical elements of Indiana jones movies. There are always some supernatural elements blend in with good adventure and action. This is stil the case with the Dial of Destiny. Bottom line is I loved the movie I don't understand why there has been so much hate for this final IJ movie. I enjoyed watching it and I will visit it time to time in the future.",
    "134": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny didn't need to exist. There's no getting around that. There was no particular desire for another Indiana Jones sequel, and whatever desire there was died in 2008 when The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull came out.I don't think this movie even really works as a sequel. I don't really think Indiana Jones, as a character, works as a washed up old man. Conceptually, it just isn't what he was for; he was always a role for a much younger man. The only way they could have bridged that gap was to have made a few more sequels 20-30 years ago or to have hired much better writers for the movie.Beyond that, this movie is easily 30-45 minutes too long. It was also in desperate need of less CGI and more practical effects.There's no real merit to this movie. There's no reason for it to be around. It never should have been made and I regret seeing it.",
    "135": "As all of you who are reading reviews of this movie on this site, I am a fan of the character and the movie series. I grew up with them and constantly watched them while growing up making numerous memories and bonding with whoever I watched it with. I am a devoted fan as much as you are.I was scared of the fifth movie. The fourth one was bad and with Ford's age and current trends in Hollywood, I really expected a mediocre blockbuster which at best you watch for fun and forget soon after. I was ready to be disappointed due to bad to mediocre reviews and rumours. Yet, despite that, me and my brother decided to go to the cinema and watch the movie for fun and judge it ourselves.Sure, I could nitpick. I could tell you the movie is too long. I could tell you that digital de-aging used in the movie's intro (despite it's cost and technological achievement) often looks like you are watching a video game/animated movie character running around. I could tell you that some action scenes are too over the top even for the franchise itself. I could tell you that it takes too long to get used to some of the characters and so on, and so on...But I could also tell you that a big warm smile from ear to ear was on my and my brother's face when the credits rolled and legendary John William's theme started playing. I was literally overflown with emotion and could cry from the feelings movie made me feel as a fan. I personally think that, even though it's obvious, undeniable and also unquestionably natural that the movie is a big nostalgia bait/trip, it's far more than a simple try to cash in on aforementioned nostalgia. The way I see it, the movie approaches both it's main character and the actor behind it, Harrison Ford, and the whole movie franchise and it's universe and characters with a lot of respect, thought, appropriate humour and care. I do not think it's a perfect movie. But I think that it's miles and miles better than the fourth one and that it can without a problem stand shoulder to shoulder with the original trilogy. And even if you don't agree with me on this one, you have to agree it's better than the fourth one. And if it's better than a fourth one, it's at least a good enough movie to watch for fun, right?So, what are you waiting for?! Grab your mom, dad, brother, sister, grandpa, grandma, girlfriend, boyfriend, friend or anyone at all you connect this character with and go say goodbye both to legendary Harrison Ford and equally legendary archaeologist with fedora and a whip he portrayed, Dr. Henry Walton \"Indiana\" Jones, Jr.! 8/10! A warm recommendation!",
    "136": "Having grown up watching, loving and enjoying the \"Indiana Jones\" movies ever since the first movie, I have to say that it was somewhat odd to sit down and watch the 2023 movie \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\", knowing that it would be the last proper \"Indiana Jones\" movie with Harrison Ford in the iconic role. But it was a movie that had to be watched, of course, to round up the adventure that started back in 1981.The storyline in \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\", as written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, David Koepp and James Mangold, certainly looked and felt like a movie that belonged in the franchise. I found the storyline and script to be adequately entertaining and enjoyable, though it wasn't the best of storylines in the franchise. But it was entertaining for what it was. I think the script fitted nicely into the supernatural line of the previous four movies, so I had no problems with the time-travel aspect of the storyline.The acting performances in \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" was good, and it was certainly nice to see Harrison Ford back in the role for one final adventure. And the moie also brought back Karen Allen and John Rhys-Davies to reprise the roles of Marion and Sallah. In addition, then the movie brought new talents to the franchise, with the likes of Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Kretschmann, Toby Jones and Antonio Banderas, so there certainly was some familiar faces and talented actors and actresses on the cast list.Visually then \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" was good. The special effects were good. However, there were some dubious moments when Harrison Ford was on the horse, where you could see it was a different actor, and also some moments when you could see that it was blatantly a CGI rendering of Harrison Ford's face, because it looked rather rigid and fake. And then there was the whole issue of making Harrison Ford younger by the use of CGI for the part of the movie that took place back in the 1940s. I can't claim that I am by any means a fan of that kind of usage of de-aging for actors and actresses, nor of fully CGI animating dead actors and actresses for movies. But of course that is a matter of personal preference.I was genuinely entertained by director James Mangold's 2023 movie \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\", despite it being the final movie for Harrison Ford. So was it a movie that saw Indiana Jones off the screen in a fulfilling manner? I hardly think so, because I was left with a sense of 'but it wasn't really a proper way to say good bye to this iconic movie character'. But the movie was entertaining nonetheless.My rating of \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" lands on a seven out of ten stars. I could and would have wished for a more meaningful good bye to Dr. Jones, but it was what it was.",
    "137": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones film series. The film stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, who races against time to retrieve a legendary dial that can change the course of history. Accompanied by his goddaughter, he soon finds himself squaring off against Jürgen Voller, a former Nazi who works for NASA.The film has a number of problems, but the biggest one is the time travel narrative. It just doesn't fit with the Indiana Jones universe. The Indiana Jones films are all about historical adventure, and time travel is a very different genre. It feels like the filmmakers were trying to be too clever, and it ultimately undermines the film.Another problem with the film is that the Nazi narrative is getting old. We've seen Indiana Jones fight Nazis in three of the previous films, and it's starting to feel repetitive. It would have been more compelling if Indiana had done a completely new adventure in the 1960s, instead of repeating the same Nazi narrative of world conquest.Overall, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a disappointing film. It has some good action sequences, but the time travel narrative and the Nazi narrative hold it back. I would not recommend this film to fans of the Indiana Jones series.Here are some specific examples of how the time travel narrative and the Nazi narrative undermine the film:The time travel narrative breaks the rules of the Indiana Jones universe. In previous films, Indiana has always been a man of his time. He's used his knowledge of history to solve puzzles and defeat his enemies. But in this film, he's able to travel through time and change the course of history. This is a major departure from the established rules of the series, and it doesn't make sense.The Nazi narrative is getting old. We've seen Indiana Jones fight Nazis in three of the previous films. It's starting to feel like the filmmakers are running out of ideas. In this film, the Nazis are trying to use the Dial of Destiny to conquer the world. This is the same basic plot as Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It's not very original.I would have liked to see Indiana Jones do a completely new adventure in the 1960s. This would have given the filmmakers a chance to do something different. They could have explored the Cold War, or they could have had Indiana face off against a new enemy. It would have been a fresh start for the series.Unfortunately, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is a missed opportunity. It's a disappointing film that doesn't live up to the standards of the Indiana Jones series.",
    "138": "Modern blockbusters undoubtedly owe plenty of gratitude to Steven Spielberg's first three Indiana Jones films, particularly \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" They helped serve as a prototype for future blockbusters, blending action set pieces with a compelling lead hero, swagger, and a ton of fun. While they sometimes feel very much (often in a good way) of a product of their generation, they still are far more well-made and entertaining than the overwhelming majority of blockbuster sequels today. Unfortunately, the fourth film in the series, \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\" was rather unsatisfying. Fortunately, this final adventure for Harrison Ford mostly learns from the mistakes of that film, and while it's definitely not on the level of the first two and arguably the third film (how could it be?) it still is an incredibly fun and enjoyable adventure for fans of the series.After a riveting and action-packed prologue, this film is set in 1969 and concerns Indiana Jones' life as a professor. He's increasingly concerned that NASA is willing to hire former Nazis to advise them on aerospace matters. He partners up with his goddaughter Helena to help find a dial that has time travel powers, and prevent it from being placed into the hands of the former Nazis. The plot of \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" is not exactly the most original, but even though Spielberg did not direct this installment, the unique trademarks of his films still come out in full force. There's whip-smart pacing and editing, clever line delivery, and an earnest emotional core between Indiana Jones and the people close to him. Despite being dramatically different tonally from James Mangold's earlier blockbuster \"Logan,\" this film actually shares a common theme about what it's like to be a hero looking into a rapidly changing world and worrying about being considered past his prime. The film's action setpieces are well-choreographed, thrilling, and engaging. They provide a sense of excitement and fun, but Mangold wisely makes sure they are never overbearing in relation to establishing a compelling and clever story. This storytelling is accentuated by strong performances. Despite his age (now 80,) Harrison Ford is just as charismatic and provides just a strong performance as Indy as ever. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is also very good as Helena, and Mads Mikkelsen is a creepily effective Nazi. The blend of action, humor, and dramatic stakes is thoroughly balanced over the 2.5 hour runtime, making the film thoroughly entertaining and never feeling tedious or overlong. A great score (John Williams is truly a legend!) and splendid period design of both late-1960s New York City and international locations help make the film more impactful and engaging. While not perfect, this is a highly entertaining blockbuster for those who love this franchise, and I believe that Spielberg would generally be proud of this installment. But above all, it's a great send-off to Harrison Ford in one of his most iconic roles, and a true blast of joy for fans of him as an actor to see him play Indy one last time. Gladly recommended. 7.5/10My ranking of the franchise is: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, Last Crusade/Dial of Destiny (tie,) Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.",
    "139": "It's been a long time since I first got myself a pirate VHS copy of The kingdom of the crystal skull and sank into it. Ever since childhood Indiana Jones was one of my favorite characters, the sole reason I became interested in archeology and everything ancient and Harrison Ford was there to guide me in my passion for history. The first three movies were masterpieces of entertainment hands down, the fourth was, well, a different, almost an alien piece of work but it was driven by the energy of father and son relationship hence it was also a good fun movie.As I sat and watched The dial of destiny I felt the movie's alien nature once again only this time it was in a bad way. Don't get me wrong it's filled with action to the brim, so much so that if you blink you'll miss some fantastic eye-dropping shot but all in all it is a bland uninspired body of work written by four people and none of them was George Lucas or Steven Spielberg.The dial of destiny could have easily been a different movie if it hadn't had Indiana Jones before it and that name alone should put a stamp of high quality on it which there wasn't. The characters are dumb and have no motivation, no stamina, no nothing to hold onto; the villains are your usual goonies with half a brain and even Mads Mikkelsen wasn't able to bring life to his just another ex-Nazi character with God's syndrome.Harrison Ford himself is old and tired as his character who should have been retired many years ago; he clearly didn't want to be Indiana Jones anymore, as much as Han Solo and he shows it in every frame with his wooden acting and one facial expression.Yes, they added a tea spoon of drama to Indiana but forgot to pour tea first which in the end turned out to be a sugary sweet version of a farewell party for Jones and Co. The adventure is mind-blowing though and the scene in Syracuse is absolutely the best part of the whole movie but overall The dial of destiny is pretty forgettable and it is an unnecessary addition to the world of the greatest archeologist with a whip and a hat but I nevertheless am glad this movie happened - to prove once again that Hollywood can never make a worthy continuation of an iconic movie.",
    "140": "I've just left the cinema feeling slightly underwhelmed, and very confused.Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny feels in many ways, like an old Indiana movie.It's wonderful to see Harrison Ford back in his best role, even if he does look far too old to be undertaking even half the things in the film.There's some solid nostalgia and references to the old films, with a few old characters popping up, and our new characters actually did a pretty good job. Mads Mikklesen, is an ok villain, if not very shallow, but personally the star is Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who shines throughout giving us constant jokes with a cheeky smile.The score was brilliant as to be expected, which accompanies car chases, ancient ruins, action scenes and all the rest. The humour is on point, it's never boring, and everything moves at a very steady pace.The first 3/4 of the movie are pretty great, and at this point I would have probably given it a 7/7.5 out of 10.But... the ending of the film is just confusing, and very underwhelming. I won't obviously give anything away, but my wife and I both said we'd really appreciate a 20 minute YouTube video explaining what on earth happened, and how did they get there?It's worth a trip to the cinema, and great to see Indiana back on our screens one final time, but it will leave you feeling rather empty inside. 6.5 / 10.",
    "141": "Went into this with pretty low expectations, which at least partly explains why I thought it was quite ok.Of course it had its share of problems. Started out with a digitally enhanced Indy taking on some nazis. Thought the cgi was pretty solid, although the lighting was deliberately low so it was harder to notice the flaws that were still there.The action scenes were fast paced in vintage Indiana Jones fashion. Harrison Ford weren't in most of them, which is understandable but still a shame. Speaking of Ford, at 80 he is still a forceful presence in every scene he's in. A true actor too rarely found these days.As fast paced as the action was, I still got the feeling I was watching a video game large portions of the film.Indys goddaughter sidekick was easily the worst thing about the entire movie. Totally annoying, none of the jokes landed and there was zero chemistry between her and Ford.Mads Mikkelsen was dependable as the adversary.It was good to see Jonathan Rhys-Davies and Karen Allen in a reunion of sorts.
