    "0": "The production of not only the show alone, but the entire film together was so well done. The messages of the album came across very well on screen and I was surprised by how well the documentary-style of the behind the curtain aspect was done. A very interesting watch regardless of if you are a fan or not, and overall paced very well if you might be concerned for the running time of the film. I was never bored. The talent working in hand with production as well as her attention to detail has made an excellent film and I will be seeing this again in theaters. Anyone that hasn't experienced the Renaissance are truly in for a treat. The longevity of her career and talent is undeniable both in-person and as a director.",
    "1": "\"I have nothing to prove to anyone at this point,\" Beyonc√© declares in her new tour documentary, Renaissance. Charting her record-breaking 2023 tour, this film offers an inside-look (written, directed and produced by Beyonc√©) at the hive required to build something as extraordinary as those live performances. Because Beyonc√© doesn't just put on a show. She puts on the show.It was blamed for the surprise rise in inflation in Sweden back in June. Combined with the equally dominating force of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, the Renaissance shows sent the US economy temporarily surging out of its pandemic slump. Around 2.7 million concertgoers attended Renaissance over the course of five months, while the tour is estimated to have grossed close to half a billion dollars. She's that girl.Beyonc√© is supported by all manner of celebrity guests, including fellow pop titan Taylor Swift, who arrives in a sheath of silver. Inside, phones are stowed away in lockbags, while audience members are handed champagne, salted popcorn and Smarties (British chocolate, nice touch). Then, gasps as the woman of the moment (of the year, of the decade!) walks onstage and thanks those who followed her \"formal opulence\" dress code to the letter.\"Thank you for coming, thank you for dressing up,\" she says, adding how proud she feels that the film is released on World Aids Day, in honour of her late uncle Jonny. \"Feel free to dance, sing, cry... thank you.\"For anyone who doubts the neccessity of a concert film, well, prepare to stand corrected. This isn't just a highlights reel. It's a rare and remarkable look at the staggering, Spielberg-style production that goes into putting on a show like Renaissance.Each two-and-a-half hour event involves myriad costume and set changes, a full troupe of dances, and a setlist spanning the 41-year-old's career to date, from her Destiny's Child days to her surprise 2013 album, Beyonc√©, which celebrates its 10-year anniversary in two weeks. Renaissance the album, released last year, pays dazzling homage to the Black and queer pioneers of post-Seventies house and disco while also celebrating her own sexual liberation. Songs such as \"I'm That Girl\" and \"Cuff It\" are delivered in a luxurious murmur, like a big cat stretching its limbs out after a good meal. \"You hate me,\" she purrs on \"Cozy\"... \"because you want me.\"\"When I am performing, I am nothing but free,\" she says in the Renaissance film. \"The goal for this tour is to create a place where everyone is free, and no one is judged. Unique.\" Regardless of this, it is impossible to deny that Beyonc√© has harnessed a level of perfectionism we rarely see in any art form. Not since Prince has a musician wielded such control over their live show. Whether she's exhibiting vocal gymnastics on \"Dangerously in Love\" or rising into the air on a silver horse while wearing a diamond-encrusted harness (Lady Godiva meets Studio 54), everything appears flawless.To achieve this, production has to be handled with the utmost precision. Beyonc√© spent four years working with choreographers, designers, crew, sound engineers, medics, security and caterers in the build-up to the tour's launch in Stockholm, Sweden, on 10 May. \"In order to perform as many times as we perform, we have three stages,\" she explains at one point in the film. \"As one is getting set up, the other two stages are travelling to the next city and getting built.\" Watching women and men dangle from harnesses, assembling giant installations and working out complex floor plans, is like watching an entirely new city being built in real time.Beyonc√© allows no room for error. Far from painting her as the benevolent queen, Renaissance shows her in all her business and creative glory. She grills her camera crew: why can't they find a wider lense? Even when there are mistakes, she turns them into new triumphs. The sound cuts out: she seizes the opportunity for yet another dramatic outfit change.Once the concert begins, for the audience it's a case of blink-and-you'll-miss-it. Dancers whirl around the stage; a disco ball descends from the rafters; Beyonc√© rides in on a lunar rover while her 11-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, dances in front. The tempo and sheer spectacle of it all leaves you breathless. No one compares.",
    "2": "I have loved Beyonce ever since I was a child! She is a part of my childhood! To see the behind the scenes of her tour is amazing! To see her peformaces up close is mesmerizing!!! She will always be my favorite artist! I think if you love Beyonce then you should definitely watch it! I love real and raw she was in this movie and how she opened up some of her personal life to her fans and the world to see! She has made a mark on this world and will forever have a lasting impact on this world and especially women everywhere! Her talent is like no other! I love her so much!!! This concert will always have a special place in my heart!",
    "3": "The ABSOLUTE BEST DOCUMENTARY/CONCERT FILM. I doubted it could top \"homecoming a film by Beyonc√©\" but IT DID! She's so vulnerable in this film and even though she is a perfectionist she shows that hard work and being dedicated to her craft is what allowed her to be portrayed that way. I left the theater feeling inspired and even having a deeper admiration for her because she is juggling being a mom, wife, friend, daughter, sister and being the GREATEST LIVING ENTERTAINER ALIVE with so much grace and poise.I also enjoyed her family moments in the film, after all Beyonc√© is human lol she's very much relatable. Blue Ivy Carter will be a force to reckon with, I was disheartened to hear that she knew of the nasty comments written about her performance BUT I was so proud she decided to rehearse everyday and get better to prove her haters wrong. She reminded me of a young Beyonc√© just eager to learn and get better.",
    "4": "It was better than the concert only because you got to experience every city without breaking the bank. I would have loved to see the tryout for the dancers. I can't wait to see what she does next. I honestly don't know how it can be topped! Me and my theater mates were singing and dancing ! Such a great experience!Also, good for Blue! She really worked hard to become better at her set. What was suppose to be one performance turned into a whole tour thing. She was so good.Extra shoutout to the editors. The cuts to other cities with different outfit was amazing! Next concert I will be buying tickets to be front row and centered. There is absolutely no reason for anything below 10 stars. It was mind blowing ! I foresee awards won for this movie!",
    "5": "The Beyonc√© Renaissance film is an absolute masterpiece! üåüüé• Beyonc√©'s talent shines bright as she takes us on a journey through her incredible career and artistic evolution. The visuals are stunning, the music is empowering, and the storytelling is captivating. It's a must-watch for any Beyonc√© fan or anyone who appreciates artistry and creativity. Prepare to be blown away! She's not just a talented singer, but also an amazing performer and an inspiration to so many people. Her powerful voice, mesmerizing stage presence, and meaningful lyrics make her music truly unforgettable. Beyonc√©'s music has a way of resonating with people on a deep level. She's a true queen in the music industry!",
    "6": "The 'Renaissance' film is an absolute vibe. Seeing Beyonc√©'s concert live was already a spiritual experience, but this movie takes it to another level. Feeling more inspired and liberated than ever, it's like Queen Bey reached through the screen and ignited a fire of self-acceptance in my soul. The way she champions gay pride in the film makes me feel seen and included, turning the concert into a personal celebration of identity. And can we talk about her work ethic? It's not just inspiring; it's a whole mood. Beyonc√© is not just an icon; she's a beacon of empowerment and fierce self-love, and this film captures every fabulous moment. üåà‚ú®",
    "7": "This concert/documentary is one of the best live action-documentary movies I have ever seen. I feel like Beyonce has finally come into her own in regards to directing. Her other project were varying degrees of good but this is well thought out, cohesive piece of work. I love how she interwove so many different aspects of into the movie: Working Mother, Wife, Performer, Woman, Black, LGBTQ+ ally, Injuries, Business owner, Musician, Creative, Leader, etc. It just felt good through and through. She has come a long way from a directorial perspective and it is very nice to see. I hope she continues in this vein. Brava Beyonce!",
    "8": "So many moments made me teary-eyed starting from 5 minutes in. There are so many joyful, sexy, reflective, and celebratory moments coupled with an entire world of lights, colors, fashion, diamonds, bass, and beauty. I felt like a total boss, a diva, a visionary, and a nurturer all in one. The entire movie audience was interactive throughout, which made us feel like we were at the concert. People around me sang, danced, cheered, and even swayed their fans. It was definitely a memorable moment! Do yourself a favor and watch if you are a fan of Beyonce or even just a fan of great music. By the time I left, I felt even more inspired to follow my passion.",
    "9": "Beyonc√©'s 'Renaissance' is an extraordinary cinematic journey, blending stunning visuals with her signature sound in a way that only she can. The film is a dazzling expression of art, music, and storytelling, redefining the boundaries of contemporary cinema. Beyonc√©'s powerful performance captures the essence of her album, bringing each song to life with an energy that's both electrifying and deeply emotive. The cinematography is breathtaking, each frame a masterpiece, showcasing a vibrant spectrum of colors and textures. This movie doesn't just entertain; it inspires and uplifts, leaving an indelible mark on the heart and soul of its audience. Beyonc√© proves once again that she's not just a musical icon, but a visionary artist whose talents know no bounds. 'Renaissance' is a must-see for anyone who appreciates the art of storytelling through music and film. It's a celebration of creativity, passion, and the enduring power of art to transform and transcend.",
    "10": "Beyonc√© is a visionary in every sense of the word. If you are a creative/artist there's so much you can learn from her. Her work ethic and determination to make her visions come to life is admirable and inspiring. The show itself was so beautiful, so bold, so creative. In a world where everyone wants to play it safe, Beyonc√© chooses to go the extra mile with her creativity. She's a very talented individual, from her God sent beautiful vocals, she can really SING, she has an amazing voice, to her precise dance moves. The songs on Renaissance embody joy and escapism, which is something the world really needs right now. Go watch the film if you haven't already, you won't regret it!",
    "11": "I'm pretty open minded when it comes to music so went into this with no expectations. I do know some of Beyonce's older music with Destiny's Child and the likes of her big hits Halo and Single Ladies.The first 10 minutes seemed fine. It is pretty much the start of one of Beyonce's concerts and her excellent vocals are on form. I thought I will enjoy this if the entire near 3 hour film is like this. The only thing I noticed what I thought was weird was the different takes of the same songs edited together, this is clear from the changing of day to night time setting but above all Beyonce's constant wardrobe changes. Fine, I could up with that niggle but it definitely became irritating later on.However then the haphazardness starts. We constantly switch between 10 or so minutes of concert footage and either backstage rehearsal footage or Beyonce reflecting on where she is in her private life (even whilst flying on a private jet - ugh) etc. It does not interest me anywhere near as much as watching what an artist can do best. Maybe as some extra footage on a Blu Ray or a separate documentary this would have been great but intertwining this with concert footage, I'm not sure is a good idea. It didn't work for me. Seeing Beyonce's backstage stuff could be interesting. Maybe as a 10-15 minute intro and after that just present an entire single concertI wanted to get back to the concert every time the backstage / private footage parts were shown...However, that turned out to be disappointing as well. The music became exceptionally monotonous, as if you are in a club all evening. Almost every song appeared to be about sex / I'm a strong female, included twerking and had no live band (I think I saw them on stage for about 5 songs). So we are reduced to listening to samples, many voice intro tracks and I guess a tape for music. I recognised two songs: Partition (not exactly a good song) and probably her biggest early solo hit: Crazy in Love. This is astonishing considering Beyonce's large early back catalogue. But I guess it has been left in the past. Which is a shame.There is also some time spent on a concert power malfunction. Maybe interesting to some but I'm not sure it's relevant.Bringing her 11 year old daughter on stage I think is bizarre considering the quite adult subject matter of Beyonce's music during most of the show. But it's up to her. Just weird seeing her daughter's mother near naked riding (both literally and figurative speaking) a tank like vehicle in the background.Maybe Beyonce feels the need to stay relevant with only doing modern club music and pushing sexual boundaries that she has done for over 20 years. It seems somewhat tiring to me to watch for so long.Now some of the visuals and props are excellent, there is no denying. There is a spectacular show there somewhere. However if it is not firstly and mostly about good music, I simply lose interest and I don't care what spectacle you bring to the table.The music is pretty drab and lacks different textures to say the least.Like where Beyonce is currently at, I had little knowledge of Taylor Swift's recent music as well a few months ago, but I thought her Eras concert film was far more digestible for an average music enthusiast and in fact I ended up watching it several times at the cinema. I also added some of Swift's songs to my music playlists. It says enough. Thus when Beyonce's film came around I thought I'd give it a shot too. But it's very, very different, and not in a good way.I doubt I could sit through Renaissance again. Even the first time felt like too much.I thus cannot recommend this film at all but to the die hard Beyonce fans who like her recent music. They will probably like this a lot, sure.",
    "12": "An Unforgettable Delight!Oh, where do I even begin? Beyonc√© is a tour de force that has left me utterly captivated, enchanted, and spellbound. Every moment of this cinematic marvel was nothing short of pure excellence, deserving nothing less than a perfect 10 out of 10 rating!It is more than a concert movie, it's a mini\ndocumentary about her struggles and travails, her journey, her dedication to her craft and to being a mum and wife; the dedication of her team to being all her dreams to life. The work that goes into having a spectacular one of a kind show. This is historicalWelldone Beyonc√©.",
    "13": "What a absolutely fun concert movie! Beyonce works hard and this film does not shy away from that. The cinematography is outstanding and it really immerses you into the movie. What I really loved about this movie was the behind the scenes footage. When going to a concert you never think about how many people are actually involved. It was also great to see Beyonce's personal side. We got to see a different side to one of the biggest artists in the world. Her love for her family and fans is admirable and there are just so many great messages to take away from the movie. This film truly is unique.",
    "14": "She IS Queen Bey for a reason. Her music and stage production are unmatched. The blood sweat and tears she puts into her career have resulted in her world wide fame and massive fortune. Beyonce Gisselle Knowles-Carter started performing at 7 years old. 35 years after stepping onto the stage for the first time she is bigger than ever. The proof is in the pudding. The couture outfits and jewelry are gorgeous. The artistry is phenomenal. Her vulnerability with her family and in her own mind are a treasure to behold. A once in a generation talent who shares the spotlight with everyone around her from her dance team to her stage assemblers to her daughter Blue Ivy Carter. From hemorrhaging vocal chords to knee surgery you cannot help but be awestruck and inspired by Beyonc√©'s spartan like will to take herself and her art further. A freedom call to all who will hear it: Renaissance is a revolution.",
    "15": "Beyonce is more open, very different from what we saw in \"Beyonc√©: Life Is But A Dream\".We see her being a mother, a boss, coming back from a difficult surgery and always wanting to improve herself, even though she says she doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, she proves that she's the best.As a director, her look became more refined, as we had already observed in Lemonade, Homecoming and Black is King, here she became more critical and always placing black people as protagonists, something that is difficult to see in the industry.Blue has been following Beyonc√© since she was very young, I remember the 2014 Grammys where she interrupted the rehearsal to call her mother, it was predictable that she would go on stage at any time and she did brilliantly.",
    "16": "This movie, was insanely well executed, it was entertaining, never once was boring! Not only do we see the immeasurable talent, we see the work ethic of Beyonc√© and her team. The cinematics, the music was astounding. I will definitely be rewatching! Seeing the hard work it takes to create a concert, the meticulous attention to detail in action is something I will never forget! This film makes you want to go back in time and attend the renaissance world tour in every country on everyday, so you can experience in greater detail what you experience in this film. The celebration of the lgtbtq+ was beautiful to see!",
    "17": "OKG I LEFT THAT AMC, KNOWING IM ALIVE BUT CAME NOT SO SURE UGH... ITS ALWAYS BEYONCE FOR ME She's so clingy she has to follow me around and be there for every new chapter in my life and I love that for us two love you Queen OMG I LEFT THAT AMC, KNOWING IM ALIVE BUT CAME NOT SO SURE UGH...

ITS ALWAYS BEYONCE FOR ME She's so clingy she has to follow me around and be there for every new chapter in my life and I love that for us two love you Queen.",
    "18": "I CANT SPEAK FOR ANYONE ELSE BUT SHE IS SUCH A QUEEN AND WARRIOR. A DEVOTED MOM AND WIFE AS WELL AS THE STANDARD FOR HIGH INTENSITY PERFORMANCES. SHE IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE YOUNGEST LIVING LEGEND IN THE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS. SHE IS EVERYTHING AND IF YOU DON'T SAY OTHER WISE YOU'RE TRULY A HATER BABY. SHE HAS NOTHING TO PROVE TO ANYONE BECAUSE SHE'S THE PACKAGE. THIS WAS MOST MONUMENTAL EXPERIENCE OF 2023 WHERE THE COMMUNITY FELT HEARD AND LIBERATED THROUGH SOMEONE WITH SUCH A HUGE VOICE AND PLATFORM. THEE BEYONC√â, FABULOUS, FEARLESS, GROUNDBREAKING AND TALENTED. HOW CAN WE NOT APPRECIATE THIS WOMAN THANK YOU!!",
    "19": "This film can be named as the best concert-film EVER, which is true. Best 3hrs of my entire life. It was directed beautifully and even though, some songs/performances didn't make it to the film, it wasnt even noticeable. PERFORMANCES were 10/10, but why am i so happy & proud of that movie? Because it shows more personal, human side of her. It shows that bey is a real human just like us. She is mother, she is wife and daughter. I ADORE THAT FILM so, if u havent watched it yet, go see it RIGHT NOW!The visuals, the aesthetics, dancers, vocals... everyone who worked on that tour & movie deserves a BIG SHOUTOUT! LOVE IT SO MUCH! CHANGED MY LIFE IN COUNTLESS WAYS. There won't be another beyonce-level singer. She is #1. Ty for attention!",
    "20": "LOVED IT! This film made me relive the amazing show I had the privilege to witness in real life! I really enjoyed the behind-the-scenes footage too, it feels great seeing Beyonc√© putting it all together, as the superior artist she is, while praising all the crew that worked so hard for this tour. They truly created a supermachine. It never stops to amaze me how she always comes up with new stuff and manages to top everything she has done before. ''RENAISSANCE: A Film by Beyonc√©'' is definitely the best gift she could give to us, her Beyhive, as this amazing year comes to an end! 1 of 1. Number 1. The only 1.Thank you, Beyonc√©!",
    "21": "I cried. I saw such a deeper level from a brilliant artist. She let us in into her pain and struggles. She created magic. It was reliving the aura/mood/feeling of being at the concert all over again. To see her hard work to entertain everyone was magical. She's a living legend. I appreciate her so much for everything she does and how she lets us in finally. The live album needs to be released. Her voice on tour is like an angel. The runs and notes she hits. Even while not feeling her best she gives her best every night of every performance. I hope she releases this digitally or physically. I will purchase in a heartbeat! Brava Beyonc√©.",
    "22": "Of course, I've always heard Beyonc√©'s music. We're of similar ages. Admittedly, her hits in the era of Single Ladies were not my cup of tea. After watching the trailer for this latest concert film of hers, I was gagged. The music had such a house vibe, which had me hooked 'cause I was a club kid. And after listening to snippets of her past albums since seeing this movie, what a dummy I was for missing out on her catalog. Now I know all the easter eggs. All the fans...it all makes sense. Uncle Johnny made my dress...dive in and you'll never wanna come up.I'm a mom, so the family dynamics behind the scenes were touching to me. Honestly, i'm very sensitive, so the trailer made me tear up. I know, i'm sappy. It's hard to fathom how she balances the immensity of this tour with her personal life. I have been to countless concerts in my life, various genres. Never have I seen a production like this. Every song was a completely different set. I really hope that she tours again so I can be one of the first to buy a ticket.I left this movie in awe, and feeling like I need to do more with my life. I will have a new respect for production when going to concerts; although none will compare to this one.If you're not a fan of house music, female power, equality, LGBTQ, this may not be the movie for you.",
    "23": "This woman is a living legend. It's hard to believe that she's human. In this movie we see how invested she is in her art and how she has a say on everything that is being shown to her audience. A mastermind. Not only that but she shares private moments of hardships and injuries she has dealt with. The audience in the movie theater was very much in the experience. We danced, cried, sang our hearts out and learned about work ethic. If you have an affection towards pop music this is very much the golden standard for creativity, performance, fashion, branding, music and so much more. Also spoke about queer culture, ballroom culture and subject of important value.Highly recommend.",
    "24": "Beyonce really is larger than life even if the film wants to portray her as no longer striving for perfection in the intimate scenes. She is an entertainer in her peak and this is definetely her best concert yet. The film isn't just a concert highlight like Taylor Swift's Era but the concert is interwoven with intimate behind the scenes and interviews with Beyonce's close circle. The film is surprisingly very emotional as well, I found myself in tears on multiple occasions. Overall, it was such a joyful experience that I can only wish I was able to see live. 10/10 recommend seeing on a big screen.",
    "25": "Beyonc√© gives us yet another look into her life and expands into what it truly means to be an ARTIST. Renaissance gives us a deeper look into the adjacent album and show's an icon's fearlessness to venture into, and nearly create a new genre of music. The film showcases ballroom music in a pop/electronic aspect, provides an in-depth look into the behind the scenes action of the film, but most notably a glimpse into a sentimental part of the life of Beyonc√© - honoring her Uncle Johnny who was an important part of her early life and stardom. The well-rounded performances are only a fraction of what the star has to offer to the entertainment industry.",
    "26": "Seriously she's still a thing she's so boring and almost average shes so basic I don't get why people are so obsessed with this below average singer I mean come on we have so many better options why is everyone such a fan for one Adele she's like 100 times better don't get me wrong beyoncay has a good voice but that's where it stops I really don't think she needs to be so popularized because she very much just pretends to be a supporter of the gay community but she's so not she's just an ugly money hungry monster liek the rest she's just got all you fools fooled haha but that ok I guess she has her way of making money and that's having a weird cult.",
    "27": "I didn't know it was possible but after experiencing this film, it made me respect and admire the hardest working woman in showbiz even more. Beyonc√© let us into her world where she wears many different hats: Business woman, Boss, Director, Performer, Singer, and most importantly Motherhood! Her vulnerability with the obstacles she faced putting together this show such as knee surgery just a month before the 1st show just blew my mind! I love the balance of concert footage and documentary where we dive deep into her thought process and intentions in every move she makes. I couldn't get enough of the moments where she showed us her interactions with her family, after each show it was back to mommy mode. Beyonc√© highlighted and celebrated everyone in this film from the crew, dancers, band, queer pioneers that never received their flowers and her Uncle Johnny. I cried, hard laughed, danced in my chair, and sung my heart out reliving one of my summer highlights of 2023! Renaissance was more just a concert, it's a culture! Thank you Beyonc√© for this amazing masterpiece.",
    "28": "The movie is for those who could not attend the concert ir wished they had experienced it up close and in detail.Nothing to comment on the performances and the work it stayed behind. As they were spectacular, visually and audibly. Yet for movie (and the price) I expected more of behind-the-scenes access, as well as for the context and cultural significance that went on the album, more interviews and commentary (with experts, other artists, etc.).Considering it is a 3-hour movie I believe it should've focused more on how the album was created, as well as all the choreography and artistry behind. And only highlight the key performances from the tour.",
    "29": "What an absolute treat for Beyonce fans! It was so much fun to re-live her concert and learn more about how the tour is put together and run behind the scenes. It is nice to see her being a mom and a business woman. Learning her history and the reasons behind Renaissance made everything even more meaningful.This was shot over the span of the entire tour. It was so much fun seeing all of her costume changes and alternate sets/songs.Obviously, if you are not a Beyonce fan there is no point in watching or even hate-rating this. I will be watching this a few more times. Honestly, I think I may have enjoyed this even more than the actual concert.",
    "30": "Beyonc√©'s 'Renaissance' is not just a concert film; it's a masterclass in performance art. Building on the formidable foundation set by 'Homecoming,' this film elevates every aspect: cinematography, sound design, and insightful documentary footage. Personally, having experienced the Renaissance World Tour live, I can attest that the film authentically captures, and at times, surpasses the concert's brilliance.The sound design is a revelation. Witnessed in IMAX, it's an auditory spectacle. The bass reverberates through your body, while Beyonc√©'s vocals are a perfect blend of power and warmth. I don't think I've ever head Beyonc√© sound better, even in a live setting.What surprised me was the emotional depth in the documentary segments. Unlike previous works, 'Renaissance' delves deep into Beyonc√©'s familial bonds, the album's inspiration, and the particularly arduous planning and rehearsal phases. It's more than just a behind-the-scenes look; it's a journey into the soul of the project, sharing the spotlight with those who inspired and contributed to this monumental experience.The concert footage is simply breathtaking. Regardless of personal opinions about Beyonc√©, her ability to deliver an unmatched live performance is undeniable. The film magnifies this brilliance with its stellar camera work, editing, and sound design. The film rips through concert dates, in Everything Everywhere All At Once style editing, and the fashion explodes onto the screen. So many colours and expert concert lighting, it all just looks and sounds so incredible. It's impossible not to be sucked into this experience.'Renaissance' is a testament to the evolution of concert films, much like Beyonc√© has redefined live performance throughout her career. This film is a transformative experience, leaving me as exhilarated as when I attended in person. It's a must-see, not just for fans of Beyonc√©, but for anyone who appreciates groundbreaking artistry in music and film.",

    "32": "Just Got out of a Renaissance Dolby Cinema Screening.I've Now Come to Realise that Beyonce is a One off.I can see why she has won so Many Awards.She's one of those things in Life that is never going to happen again. We will never ever see a Performer like this again.Now of course, there's a lot of Up and Coming Singers/Performers out there and still ones yet to be born. But honestly, I can't see anyone at the very least matching Beyonce in Sheer Routine Skill, Bodily Movement & Ability, Coupled with Singing Ability.Renaissance by Beyonce -1.ü¶Ñ At 42 years old, she still looks good.2. üé• The Cinematography of the Songs was Good and in Certain Moments, it was Shocking. Her movements at multiple times within the film were just outstanding.2a.

There were other Eye popping Body movements she pulls off with Such skill. One of those was the Robot Movements with her Backup Dancers along side her, if you blink, you would literally miss the Snappy Movements.3.üíñ The film had good Edits during the Songs and also it was good to see the backstage segments of what she was going through in preparation and her sheer drive in her Mentality to help produce the best possible show she could deliver.4. üå† Beyonce was always so Skillful in her Dancing Routines and Singing, but Man, after seeing it loud and direct in Dolby Cinema, what a Performer she is! At this point, she really is a Living Legend.5.üíç She Had Beautiful Costumes throughout the film6. üíé The different Stage Screen Themes and Layout was Great to See.Overall, one of the Top films of 2023, one of those Films I will Remember, it was an Energetic, Insightful and Beautiful Watch.üí´",
    "33": "LIKES:The Sound Quality\n-Let's get the obvious out of the way and talk about how the theater really maximizes the sound quality in this experience.-A concert requires this be on point, and Beyonce's guidance did not fail to deliver room shaking bass, engaging beats, and q musical storm that shakes the clothes.-Fantastic editing to make sure every sound stays balanced and heard, beautiful support of her vocals, and these background effects kept me ingrained, illustrating a great use of the art of sound making to the highest quality yet.-To even use a trick about a concert snafu and ingraining that...stellar design and clever tricks that really impressed me.The Camera Angles:\n-You want to feel like you are in the concert and experiencing it from every angle? Then again, props to the editing and film crew of this piece.-Renaissance does great things with the guidance of the camera work, constantly moving around to give you the whole stage timed beautifully to help enhance musical number\n-Shots of Beyonce's props, key dancing moments and instrument playing, a balance of wide and focused angles, and even crowd views, all achieve a goal of integration that takes this movie to higher levels of concert conversion.-Alongside good filters, high quality imaging, with ingraining a camera phone filming perspective , the movie accomplished for me, an experience that felt like \"I'm there\".The Songs: -I have not been on the tour, nor do I know most of her work outside local radio the last few years, but the concert has a lot of her new edge that other audience members were dancing to.-It's got great power, a live presence that matched the studio recording with clear vocals, and killer stage presence that helps somehow enhance the musical presence of the movie.-So, for fans of her music, you are going to really enjoy what the Queen and her cast, especially her sound engineers, really accomplished much in this regards.The Choreography:\n-You may not like the music, you may not like the dancers, but it's going to be hard to not give them props for some insane dance numbers they put on in this show.-The control these people have in their bodies with this strength to pull off these taxing movies was impressive to me A few members had my favorite moves, doing so much with stamina and movement really brought something to the stage just past her singing.-Hip hop and Pop and Lock reign the dominant style for me, but the way they keep the coordination and mood, adjust for the angles, and integrate so much into the performance... quite awesome in helping add that concert atmosphere.The Special Effects:\n-While certainly more impressive in person, Beyonce has brought a stellar show of her stage effects to the silver screen\n-Laser light show are just the base of this piece, a really cool light effect that does some wicked tricks with the computer screen and the air that would be stellar to see.-Pyrotechnics accomplish much in the way of a contained firework show, helping to give contrast and framing to the impressive props she rides around the stage.-And of course, the massive screen behind her holds character, albeit weird for me, that transitions into some of the coolest stage designs I've seen in a long time. A fine fit of technology with real life effects accomplished much for this reviewer and may be one of the best aspects for theater viewing.The Costumes:\n-I can't' say most of the outfits were my cup of tea in terms of sexual prowess. But fI was impressed at the designs holding up to the demanding performances.-Color's are bold, alongside a lot of texture based designs with shiny rhinestones, very silky material, and unique prints that are original, matching the energy of the performance and eye catching.-They hold up well to the demanding moves of the wearers, look great in a lot of the lighting, and match the leader's unique outfit with coordination that I find amazing by the design team.-And as this is a concert film, the editing gives you plenty of time with all styles, transitioning the moment on the show to essentially swap the costumes rapidly as if paper dolls were their canvas.The Editing:\n-Another nod from me, the editing accomplishes a lot with the effects to take all the things above and bring them together in a very engaging piece.-The costume tricks alone were impressive, but there was so much more to the film, a logical presentation of shots and elements to make me feel like VIP concert member.-Alongside picking key moments, there was a great combination of the tour, and parts of the nonconcert material, it helps give you this documentary/concert that has personality and tries to give one the \"full\" experience. Only tripping a few points.The Behind The Scenes:\n-Perhaps my favorite part of this piece, the behind the scenes was perfect for a geek like me to see how it all comes together to make this giant spectacle.-Construction of the show, the costumes, and the planning took my favorite spot, just seeing so many people coordinating with Beyonce to make this show.-For those who are big on the current movements, you have plenty of praise and representation in this film and even have messages that the queen wants to share that hold the vibes of the concert.-And for those who put the artist on Olympian Goddess level, you'll get more than enough time with her struggles and attitude to the artistry. Some of these, were inspiring for me, primarily seeing the hard work in planning the show and her family history that explains a lot.DISLIKES:Less Editing On Numbers:\n-Going to a concert, I like to see the whole song like some artists have done, and this movie cut a fair number of songs midway through their performance.-While some of these were brilliant cuts, some of my favorite songs were interrupted too soon for me and I really wanted to se them to closure and what she could cap them with her magical touch.-If this is a concert movie, I kind of wanted a bit more focus on that, including more time with the band shots that sometimes got lost to the other angles.-In addition, I don't need to see about a fourth of the movie flashing to the fans at the concerts. I get it's about unity, and there is a message, but again, I'm here for the concert numbers, where my audience involvement is my fellow theater attendants.The Beyonce Glorification:\n-My favorite behind the scenes stuff is seeing the hard work of this woman and the planning of the show, seeing the strength to balance work and family to A levels.-But past that point, the movie's portrayal of her personal life and pride did little for a regular person like me.The film felt very edited/social media like, highlights, fake phrasing, and very dramatic messaging that does not do much for me, that it took away from the things I was enjoying seeing.-That effect carried over into the background dancers' tales as well, and though the cultural feel is there, the doctoring and dramatic telling just feel a bit too pushed for me.-And of course, if you aren't a fan of the attitude, you aren't going to like some of the aggressive lines used at times, as it's a very big focus on her new persona which is just not what I like about Beyonce.Too Sexualized:\n-My concerts of choice are about the music, the dancing, and perhaps not fully on sexual imagery and attitude.-This was not the song list for me, nor the show, with Beyonce's new direction being very aggressive, very big on inviting poses, and lyrics that beat this drum to death.-No shame to anyone who likes this. It's just not the concert experience I particularly like, preferring her previous shows and albums to this show where body, anger, and attitude lyrics are the primary focus.-The message she says is important about loving yourself and pride, but I just felt this movie did not take the best approach to presenting it, going again more PSA than performance.-As the shots showed, the movie was who love her new work and agree whole heartedly with the message, you won't find this a dislike at all, but approaching from a general point, this is again going to be a warning and limitation.The VERDICT:\nAnother win in the concert experience, Beyonce's Renaissance accomplishes much in the way of documentary with musical concert experience. Sensational effects are the thing that won me over to stay in this long movie, seeing so many great shots of wonderful stage effects that really make a theater the optimum way. To build alongside the performance really was impressive to me, and the constant angle changes and editing really optimize the viewing experience. Throw in a wonderful sound editing to help make sure you get everything, alongside creative choices, and well, it's hard not to give props to the work at hand. Alongside an experience of the behind the scenes, including glimpses into her life, well, the Beyonce fan is easily going to give this a 9 or a 10. For me though, the movie doesn't have the song variety of other concerts, focusing more on aggressive sexualization and other political topics that do little for a reviewer like me. When the glimpses are doctored of her life to sometimes fuel that fire, the concert escapism is lost and a regular Joe like me loses the enjoyment despite the message trying to be conveyed. From all of this, my score is difficult to put, but as I'm going for movie overall vs. Concert personification, the scores are going to vary based on how different the media are:Music/Concert/Documentary: 8.0-8.5\nMovie Overall: 5.0.",
    "34": "Renaissance: A film by Beyonc√© is a spellbinding blend of concert magic and behind-the-scenes documentary charm.

    "35": "My wife and I attended Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc√© (2023) in theaters last night. The film delves into the meaning of Renaissance, the intricacies of assembling the tour, influences from Beyonc√©'s past evident in the concert, aspects of her life (past and present), and, naturally, the tour itself.Written and directed by Beyonc√© Knowles herself, the film features cameos by Jay Z, Kelly Rowland, Diana Ross, Kendrick Lamar, Blue Ivy Carter, Michelle Williams, Megan Thee Stallion, Tina Knowles, and Matthew Knowles.This film is a meticulous exploration of details, emphasizing the effort behind a world tour, the impact of family on her artistry, the complexities of her current family life, and her evolving state of mind. Beyonc√© effectively highlights various tour outfits, performance venues, and audience reactions, incorporating concert segments, docuseries elements, and almost music video-like scenes. Notably, there's a potential new song to wrap things up. üëÄ. Everything about this movie is perfect.In conclusion, Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc√© is a captivating and elite concert film, offering a unique viewing experience. I would give it a perfect score of 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",
    "36": "Having attended the Renaissance World Tour in May, I wasn't sure whether I would watch Renaissance: A Film By Beyonce but then I remember how much I enjoyed the Homecoming documentary on Netflix. Not only did I watch it in the end, but I saw it from the balcony of Cineworld's Superscreen which boasts an incredible wall to wall screen, immersive Dolby Atmos sound and two floors which made feel like I was in the a stadium all over again but a little closer and with better sound. This was the perfect screen to soak up a 2 hour and 48 minute spectacle.Firstly, reliving the performances on the big screen was amazing. Viewers feel Beyonce's energy up close and personal as well as that of her dancers, many of whom have become recognisable names and faces over the years. We also see close shots of fan reactions and sometimes see the performance from their vantage point which drives home how mesmeric Beyonce's on screen presence has become. The Renaissance 'tourdrobe' is on full display as we flash between difference performances of the same song which allows the audience to revel in the Beyonce's outstanding wardrobe (Uncle Johnny made it). One of the best things about the 'tourdrobe', is that it's easy to recognise the location you attended based on the outfit Beyonce was wearing, if not the stadium architecture. London was easy to spot! Those who didn't attend live will recognise several outfits from viral clips.Whilst the performances are stunning and worth the admission price, it's the behind the scenes content and commentary from Beyonce that adds the cherry on top without ever feeling that they were taking away from the show. As per usual, Beyonce sweats over each miniscule detail of the show. She praises everybody from the stage crew to the backing dancers, highlighting how important their role is. The is an emotional segment where we witness Blue Ivy's first performance and its aftermath. This is one of many moments that we get to witness between Beyonce and a family member, friend or tour family. Importantly, Beyonce speaks of the motivation and inspiration for the album. A Renaissance, a new beginning where everybody can and should be comfortable in their own skin.This was an entertaining, energetic and insight look into the Renaissance tour.",
    "37": "First of all...10, 10, 10! IT was perfection!Bro.... Beyonc√© is BUILT DIFFERENT! NO ONE is in her league! She is a once in a lifetime artist. She is like SCARY GOOD!She has so much on her plate and how she juggles her life personal and professional is awe inspiring. No one works as hard as her. Watching this film is like being inside of a body and seeing how everything works. Beyonc√© and her team are amazing the way they work together, but Beyonc√© being the one the centers it all. I do not envy being the boss of all those of people. She makes it work though. All the behind the scenes with her family is beautiful!The transitions gagged me. Idk if documentaries are eligible for the editing Oscar... if they are, this definitely deserves at least a nomination.The theater cried, cheered and danced the night away!A job well done Beyonc√©!",

    "40": "Beyonc√© is an interesting singer as while I am not a big fan of hers, I have enjoyed a couple of her songs in the past and some of her movie roles she had done. This documentary explores her Renaissance World Tour and the behind the scenes moments and there are some pretty good camerawork and discussions about the event. Including some gorgeous color presentations and uses of the music and soundtrack that helps to build the narrative and setting. But because I am not emotionally invested with her previous work \"Homecoming\" or \"Black Is King\" and her musical works, I felt both interested and bored watching this.I mentioned there are good discussions explored about the creation of her album and the tour but there are discussions that dragged quite a bit or felt like they went nowhere. With the interviews and guests featured, there are some guests that were interesting but some guests that didn't really impacted the discussions and felt a bit awkward since their discussions and interviews felt a bit cringeworthy and slightly got on my nerves. With the movie being the runtime of 168 minutes, the pacing is pretty uneven and certain scenes felt unnecessary. I understand the heart and passion of what Beyonc√© is trying to communicate but I just wasn't emotionally connected with it. I gave this one a watch since I like to give all kinds of movies a chance but just like Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, it's not for me.Overall, Beyonc√© is one talented singer and actress/filmmaker but I didn't emotionally connect with the documentary. I do recommend it for Beyonc√© fans tho.",
    "41": "It was absolutely supreme! She is the best artist and genius woman of the time!Beyonc√©, it's a name to be remember for the eternity, she is a piece of art, a legendary figure of our generation.Her legacy is something unique and it will be always alive, so, this film is something to be always in our screen!Renaissance, remember us that we don't have to prove anything to anyone, we can create our in future! To see all the production and understanding that with love and hard work everything is possible!It's about family, it's about us!I'm blessed to be alive and be able to live in the same age as Beyonc√©. üáßüá∑",
    "42": "I have seen a couple of good movies this year, but this one is perhaps the best I've seen.What I am about to say next will have many critics and movie snobs throwing up and crying themselves to sleep, but it is true. Oppenheimer is definitely up there as one of the best movies of the year, but quite honestly, it pales in comparison to Renaissance: A Film By Beyonc√© as it relates to the sheer audaciousness and meticulousness of the editing, costume design, stage design, production, and direction. No doubt, Beyonc√© will not get a tenth as much credit as Christopher Nolan despite writing, producing, and directing her movie. But oh boy, does she deserve to. Both movies are similar length, but where Renaissance's runtime feels much less than it is, Oppenheimer's felt longer.Now, I am no Beyonc√© fan (I was dragged along by someone that is) and I was frankly filled with much trepidation going to see it, but I am glad I did. There is no way you can watch this movie and not leave feeling at least somewhat inspired and awed by Beyonc√©'s talent and the overall experience.It is a truly thrilling experience and it gave me a newfound respect for Beyonc√© and her work ethic. I left feeling inspired and feeling as though I had possibly just seen the greatest to ever do it, something which I could not have envisioned saying before the movie.If you have sons and daughters, please take them to see this movie. Not only is it a concert, but it infuses itself with backstage footage and the preparation that went into the Renaissance tour. You get to see how someone at the top of their craft navigates the obstacles and challenges of putting on a project of this magnitude by being blunt and direct when needed, and yet still doing so with exemplary grace. You have to respect the way Beyonc√© handles herself, considering she is one of the most famous and powerful women in the world. What a fantastic role model.Ultimately, I highly recommend this movie to anyone. I can honestly say I have not had more fun at a movie theatre in a long time.10/10.",
    "43": "Somehow, this movie made me respect Beyonc√© even more. Her work ethic and attention to detail showcased throughout the WHOLE FILM was inspiring.This movie has everything; I laughed, was in awe, and even teared up at parts. The montage about UNCLE JOHNNY was so heartfelt and touching; the fact that he isn't on this earth to see what Beyonc√© has created in his honor is heartbreaking.Seeing this with my Mom, who I went to see Beyonc√© with as well, was so important. The message about being a mom and being there for your children was so beautiful and made me so thankful that I got to experience this whole thing with my Mom.The editing and soundscape for this film was on a whole new level. The constant cuts to different outfits, the loud bass, and the hundreds of different camera angles made it a whole different experience compared to the concert.It is obvious to me that Beyonc√© is the greatest living entertainer of our time and that NO ONE is on her level. The fact that she was so involved in every single aspect of this tour and movie is so impressive. She truly created a film and tour that uplifts everybody and did it in a way that looks BREATHTAKING on screen and in person.So long story short, this movie is fantastic, and EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT ON THE LARGEST SCREEN POSSIBLEüëëüêù",
    "44": "Full of life, inspiration, tears, etc. Beyonce, what a job well done on this movie. The movie was such an innovative work of art to say the least. The transitions, the realness, the quality, oh my gosh what a work of art. The Beyonc√© Renaissance film marked a transformative moment in the intersection of music, art, and cultural expression. Released as a visual album, it seamlessly blended storytelling with Beyonc√©'s musical prowess, creating a cinematic experience that transcended conventional boundaries. This groundbreaking work, often referred to as a film due to its narrative structure, is a testament to Beyonc√©'s ability to redefine artistic mediums. One of the film's strengths lies in its visual storytelling. Each song serves as a chapter, weaving a cohesive narrative that explores themes of identity and empowerment. The visual aesthetics are a feast for the eyes, with stunning cinematography that captures the essence of each track. From intimate moments to grandiose set pieces, the film is a visual spectacle that enhances the emotional impact of the music. Beyonc√©'s commitment to celebrating LGBTQ+ and heritage is a central theme throughout the film. The use of rich symbolism, vibrant colors, and diverse landscapes pays homage to the groups diverse culture. It goes beyond mere aesthetic choices, becoming a powerful statement on the importance of pride and unity. This celebration resonates globally, fostering a sense of inclusivity and appreciation for the richness of LGBT greatness. Moreover, the film is a showcase of Beyonc√©'s artistic evolution. Her ability to experiment with genres while maintaining a cohesive narrative is commendable. From soulful ballads to energetic anthems, each song contributes to the film's emotional depth. It reflects not only her musical versatility but also her growth as an artist unafraid to push boundaries and challenge the status quo. The incorporation of social commentary adds another layer of complexity to the Beyonc√© Renaissance film. It addresses issues such as racial injustice, gender inequality, and the power dynamics inherent in the entertainment industry. By intertwining these themes with her personal narrative, Beyonc√© transforms the film into a platform for meaningful discourse, encouraging viewers to reflect on societal challenges while celebrating resilience and triumph. In essence, the Beyonc√© Renaissance film is a masterful convergence of music, storytelling, and visual artistry. Its impact extends beyond the realm of traditional albums or films, solidifying Beyonc√©'s status as a cultural icon. By pushing artistic boundaries and addressing relevant social issues, she has created a work that resonates with audiences on a profound level. This film not only cements Beyonc√©'s place in the pantheon of musical legends but also sets a new standard for the potential of visual storytelling in the modern era."
