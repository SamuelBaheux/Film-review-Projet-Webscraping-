    "0": "In my opinion, there are two major issues with The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. First of all, the timing and momentum of the movie are too slow, and the acting is not on par with that of the original series' cast. While the original movies had a lot of fine acting and characters that I cared deeply about, I did not relate to any of the characters in The Ballad. The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is not a total disaster, but it is mediocre at best, with some parts being too lengthy and others too short. Having read the original books and being mostly satisfied with both the books and the movie adaptations (despite their flaws), I cannot say whether the mess in storytelling is due to the book or just the movie's script, as I have not read The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes. Also Songbirds & Snakes reminds me of that bad last Star Wars trilogy - they copied everything from the original source but failed to catch the soul, charm and grandeur entirely, everything just felt formulaic, even dead.",
    "1": "Funny people in the comments not expecting songs from a movie that starts with the name THE BALLAD OF.The whole point of the movie was to show how Snow starting rising to power and also how the Capitol started being manipulated into start liking and watching the games.It was a great adaptation, the most faithful one since Catching Fire. Rachel Zegler is a great singer and a great actress. The songs are very important to the story, every song contains an important part of the movie ESPECIALLY the one she sings laying down by the lake.People need to actually pay attention to what they're watching.",
    "2": "I'm staggered by the stupidity of the script, the characters, story arcs, motive, plot. It's mindless and random most of the times, seemed like an AI wrote it based on a templates of generic films. Good guy turns bad just because story needs him to be, two characters fall in love just for the sake of it. The dialogue between friends is constant plot point and a script note where main dude always highlights how he is poor and his friend has a rich dad, it can become a fun game because whenever these two are in the scene together you start to expect it to be mentioned, and it always does lol. Very bad, maybe writers strike affected it, but it's based on a book and I don't know maybe it's the source, I doubt I'll read it after this anyway.",
    "3": "Once you notice how they feel the need to say « Lucy Gray » all the time, you won't be able to unhear it, it's painful. Lucy Gray this, Lucy Gray that...\nViola Davis is excellent, atmosphere and setting are ok, but all in all it feels like you're watching 3 different movies in one, scenario is - again - the main issue. Main actor lacks charisma and just isn't good enough to be a lead. The singing is really annoying, I don't care if it's like that in the book, they could have integrated it in a much better way. The guitar thing at the tribute presentation... is it X-Factor? And I really wanted to like this movie...",
    "4": "As someone who has read the book, seeing it come to life on screen was incredible. It's always interesting to see how certain things from the book were adapted on screen, adding a new experience to the story I've read.The production value, scene locations, and overall ambiance were simply amazing, capturing the essence and aesthetics of the book properly.The music, especially \"The Hanging Tree\", that Katniss sang in the original trilogy, was a highlight, linking this prequel to the original trilogy nicely. Also, the song that Olivia Rodrigo did for this movie \"Can't Catch Me Now\" fit the film's mood and themes well.",
    "5": "This movie isn't really \"bad\" as much as ot is bland and souless.I don't exactly what to blame here. The characters have similar dialogues to the ones found in the books. The actors do good acting. The scenes have the right pacing. Yet, the movie is boring and you end up not caring about anything that happened.I guess reading the story from the point of view of cunning Snow helps us understand better his feeling and motivations, here we don't have that and the actor have next to no chemistry! Their actions don't seem like a natural progression of their love and feel more like \"this happens next cause the book said so\".I was really looking forward to watching it. This movie was such a let down for me.",
    "6": "Initially I didn't like the ending. I didn't like how they just made her 'disappear'. I was voicing my frustration to my sister the entire way home; No chase? No fighting? No crying, no betrayal, no epilogue, no letter? Nothing??? It was so anti-climactic! Like she never even existed!But then Highbotton's words rang clear: mystery has a way of driving people mad. If we the audience were this frustrated, imagine just how delirious it must've made Snow. She could've outed him, betrayed him, stood up to him, maybe even messaged him- he must've searched for her if just to get rid of the last loose end (before he became too powerful to even bother with this anymore, of course), but he found absolutely nothing! Nothing to chase, nothing to hate, nothing to even confirm that it was real other than his fading memories, white roses and a ghost of her who with the same spirit sings that damn song under the hanging tree.I can't help but think that what if she'd stayed? He'd lied, and he had violence, and all those other bad things in his being already, but the only thing that was keeping him from going through that door was Lucy gray. It doesn't excuse nor explain his action (not even by the slightest) but I can't help but wonder if she'd stayed, would he still turn out that way? Not necessarily the whole tyrannical dictator coming into power stuff- but fundamentally could he have become a better human being? Could he have changed? And was her departure his sign to finally cave in, or was he going to turn out like that anyway?Also the hunger games were freaking crazy I loved every second of it, favorite part of the movie. Jason Schwartzman was perfect.",
    "7": "I like the other hunger games movies, with their high and lows they were enjoyable. They were a good transposition of the books.With this one I was waiting impatiently for the end.Performances felt a little bit off, as off felt the dialogues. However the main problem to me is the lack of a central idea. It is not clear if they wanted to show a specific edition of the hunger games, if they wanted to explore Lucy and the other tributes, if they wanted to tell the story from Snow's perspective or if they wanted to explain how the modern hunger game came to life. The film it's all over the places, characters are not explored nor do they make an effort to allow the viewer to empathize with them, they're so empty and unlikable.If this is not enough they even sing. Lucy Grey straight out from the arena, after seeing the death of 24plus people is on a stage singing like a mermaid. And the singing goes on and on to the point where I can confidently sai that the last 30 minutes the film become a musical.The only likable character is portrayed by Dinklage and he dies.",
    "8": "Loved the first 4 movies, so I was very curious about this one. Honestly, I haven't seen anything this bad in a long time. The whole thing felt like a mess, was boring. Didn't even understand the singing scenes. The worst part was Rachel's acting. I don't think she was ready for this movie. She didn't do a great job in my opinion, at all. The only thing I was thinking about the hole time is her bad acting skills. She was way too much in this. I'm just disappointed. Could've been much much better movie.It's always a big risk to recreate a big hit or even follow the storyline, but man oh man.....",
    "9": "As someone who has read the book multiple times, this is an awful adaption of an incredibly well written book. The entire movie is rushed to the point where it should have been split into two. Important characters are barely involved or completely cut out. How do you show Clemencia get bitten by the snakes then nothing of her afterwards????! No Pluribus Bell, Satiria or interactions with the Plinths... Viola Davis is a remarkable job with what she was given, but come one!!! No Hippity hoppity, not once? So much of the fear of her character comes from her craziness and it was missing.There was absolutely no chemistry between Snow and Lucy Gray. Their relationship is completely left out of the movie and that is due to the rush through of the story. Rachel Ziegler was a terrible choice for this role. She may be able to sing, but cannot act at all. Her entire portrayal of Lucy Gray was off and disappointing.The book it full of character development for Coriolanus Snow that isn't depicted in the film. You don't see the struggle he has within himself, let alone the final blow to his goodness by loosing the trust and love of Lucy Gray. This change is what makes Snow who he is later in life and why, I believe, he hates Katniss. There are many similarities between these two women and Katniss reminds him of a past weakness and betrayal. This is shown by subtle foreshadowing. Unfortunately we don't see these changes of character in the movie and that is the entire point of the book. To find out why Snow became an evil and spineless person without feeling.So many important moments were left off or changed that it was frustrating and took every ounce of self control not to walk out of the theater. Poorly done...",
    "10": "Moves at an unnaturally fast pace and had visibly been condensed, nay, tortured, into a 3 hour film, leaving no time to convey any kind of emotional complexity to any of the characters nor connect with them. As a result, a relatively boring movie. It felt as though there was so much context to provide there was no time to make it enjoyable. Some exciting parts but this was only attributable to Suzanne Collins' writing; I believe the directors heavily relied on the plot already written for them. Rachel exaggerated jaw acting made this not only a boring watch but a difficult one. Lucy Gray was a textbook manic pixie dream girl - I thought cinema would be more self aware by now.",
    "11": "I came out of the cinema with my friend and we both wondered what we had actually just seen.Is this a villain origin story?Because if so, then why is there NO character arc for Snow at all?From the moment you meet Coriolanus Snow (despite the lacking story still wonderfully played by Tom Blyth), he is selfish, overly ambitious and mean. For this reason, I don't buy into his romance with Lucy for a minute, and I actually think they didn't want you to. But if the romance isn't real, that means there is no catalyst for Snow's character to make him evil, because as I said, he was already selfish, manipulative and mean to begin with. It makes you wonder why we needed this film in the first place.Next to this, I didn't understand Lucy's character. She wears colorful clothes, lots of make-up and sings musical songs which all feels off for someone living in district 12.On top of this, I also didn't understand her motives and emotions. Is she angry she has to fight for her life in the hunger games? She didn't really seem to be to me, as she quickly trusts Snow and eats his food and even tries to kiss him. And then when she wins the fight you would expect her to be traumatized and bitter, but no, she just picks up her guitar again and dances around in her not-so-Gray clothes.Finally, as the romance isn't real, why did she invite Snow to escape with her to the North and then on the way there tries to get rid of him?! It just didn't make sense to me AT ALL.Still gave this three stars because I liked Tom Blyth's performance and the visuals were nice, I guess.",
    "12": "Weak story line and awfuly slow burn.There does not appear to be and structure to the movie, the story line jumps and clearly the writers are just hoping the previous movies popularity is going to sell tickets and bring people to watch this.The acting is barely on par with B movie and this has been so openly advertised as something it is not!Do not waste your time, go watch the original movies and appreciate good acting, writing and directing along with the excellent casting... who are all these unknown actors? Is it too hard or costly to get someone worthwhile to star in a movie in the 22st century!",
    "13": "I had very high hopes for this film. The book was great, but the movie was horrible. Only Tom Blyth does a good job acting in this film, the rest of the cast... not so much. Rachel Ziegler just isn't a great actress, granted she is a very talented singer and has a great voice, which is put on display in this movie. However, she just isn't a great actress. The film has the worst cast I have ever seen for a spin off of such a successful original series. I put blame on the casting director for that. The movie also came in a bit longer than most of the other movies and kind of felt a little dragged out. Overall, I'm very disappointed.",
    "14": "I really wanted to like this movie, I rewatched all the originals right before and it only made this movie look so much paler in comparison. The actual \"Hunger Game\" in the movie at its most basic state in the timeline was entertaining while it lasted and the lead playing a young Snow along with Viola Davis chewing the scenery as a maniacal villain are the highlights, but too many musical numbers (there was all of one instance of singing in the original series) along with the stiff acting of the female lead and the tired length, made this seem like a Hunger Games if it was made by Disney. A bit too cheesy and long in the tooth, and a disappointment when held in regards of what came before.",
    "15": "One of the worse movies i have ever seen and ive seen some bad ones. This seems to be a terrible trend with reboots of a successful franchise, simply put the name in the title and any old garbage in the scrtpt and hope it will sell. This fails on every aspect from acting to directing to cinematography. Rachel zegler is badly miscast and really lame, at least jennifer lawrence was believable as a badass but zegler just dosnt cut it. Its about time holywood stopped piggybacking off successful franchises and started to come up with more original concepts before irreparable damage is done to the movie industry.",
    "16": "I am appalled by this movie!! There was no plot, no suspension, no character development OR depth. How can they call this a Hunger Games prequel?? It gave no insight into the world of the Hunger Games and instead left me feeling confused, annoyed and quite frankly sad. This was some kind of Taylor Swift love story musical set in the world of the Hunger Games but with no real connection to the characters we have previously come to love and admire. As we were watching the movie people actually started walking out of the theater ....THAT's how bad it was. AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON THE SINGING AND SCRIPT. In conclusion, do not see this movie.",
    "17": "It had so many things in. Yes it's a flashback film,it contained metaphors. But these were a bit complicated to understand. If you cannot carch the details in the sentences you cannot understand it. Also there wa so many things happening. I think the idea had too many thing in it. It was giving the vibe :Lets add this,oh! This too. We can't skip this, let's add this too! There were so many thing. It could be done as part 1 and part 2. Since there's so many things happening, it became boring and boring. And the ending was(for me) very missing and a bit silly and unnecessary. It could be much better. For me the performance of the film was equal with the Thor-Love and Thunder.",
    "18": "It's been a while since I didn't saw a movie I couldn't finish. I was so excited to watch it since I'm a huge fan of hunger game but it was disappointing. The characters are blend, you don't get attached to them, the pace of the movie is weird it's rushed but at the same time nothing happens. The relationship between Snow and Lucy gray was rushed too and so cringe, like girl you don't fall in love after the 2nd time seeing the person that get pay if you don't die.You know the feeling when you wait for the movie to really start but it never really start? I was able to watch half of the movie out of curiosity but couldn't reach the end, it was too hard to watch.I think I'll just read the book at this point after reading some reviews that say that the movie didn't do justice to the book.",
    "19": "This fifth film in the Hunger Games cinematic universe is insightfully written by Michael Lesslie and Michael Arndt, based on the novel of the same name by Suzanne Collins, and efficiently directed by Francis Lawrence.Tom Blyth excels in his role as young Coriolanus Snow and Rachel Zegler's luminous presence radiates through the screen as Lucy Gray Baird.\"There's a natural goodness built into us all. No. Really. We can either cross that line into evil, or not. And it's our last work to stay on the right side of that line.\" - Lucy\"I am going to get you out of here. But if I'm going to risk everything, tell me, is this real?\" - CoriolanusTheir love story is as intense as it is brief and as hopeful as it is revealing of what human beings become when civilization disappears.",
    "20": "I don't know why this girl or young lady was cast. Having JL as the main female lead in the last one. In my opinion she RZ can't hold a candle to her previous female counter part. She is so mono tone and her facial expressions are very lacking. She just was not near ready for this type of role. Her past roles she could get by just being somewhat pretty and that's about it. I think the movie industry has never recovered since covid. And trying to reboot everything isn't helping. PD and VD do an amazing job. The main male character does well. However the two have zero chemistry it's like AH acting next to JD.",
    "21": "I was completely uninterested in the film because of the terrible performance and the uninteresting plot. The movie seemed to go on forever, and I found myself fidgeting with my phone multiple times since I was bored with all the dull scenes.Much as in the literature, the characters speak in a similar manner. The acting is top-notch. The scenes are paced appropriately. Still, you don't care about a single plot point since the film is so dull.In comparison to the previous Hunger Games films, this one was terrible. My excitement at the announcement of a new Hunger Games film was palpable because I adored the first four films in the series. There was just too much graphic and pointless violence in this film.",
    "22": "We felt cheated. Love the book's author, loved the entire original Hunger Games books and movies, and my husband and I really looked forward to this movie. As dark as the original stories were, they were bright and colorful compared to this movie. The world in Snow's youth seemed even more dangerous and uglier than when Katniss came into the story, which made me wonder why were supposed to be so worried about her. The acting wasn't very good, the screenplay was awful, and the sense of doom and ugliness made me want to take a shower when we got home. Frankly, we wouldn't encourage anyone to see it. I wish we'd gotten our money back.",
    "23": "So, having seen the previous 4 films, I did hear not long after there would be prequels to follow. Of course, time went on & there was little to no word if a prequel was coming until I saw a trailer pop up a few month prior to me seeing this & to be honest, I didn't feel bought by it, but still, being a fan of the Hunger Games, I went to see this nonetheless.Years before he becomes the tyrannical president of Panem, 18-year-old Coriolanus Snow remains the last hope for his fading lineage. With the 10th annual Hunger Games fast approaching, the young Snow becomes alarmed when he's assigned to mentor Lucy Gray Baird from District 12. Uniting their instincts for showmanship & political savvy, they race against time to ultimately reveal who's a songbird & who's a snake.I found the film to be surprisingly good & better than what I thought. I mean, it wasn't as upbeat or vibrant as the first 2 Hunger Games Films, but still was action packed enough & watchable despite dragging near the end & in other places too. The films runtime is 2 hours & 27 minutes in length & could've 20-25 minutes shorter.The characters were good & memorable enough & the games were exciting enough & enjoyable when the action did kick into gear. The music & visuals were good as with the effects that were used. Though I do feel the film could've benefited from being livened up a bit & again, be faster paced & shorter. It lacks the feel of the original films, but of course I did expect as much with this film being a prequel to the first 4 films.Overall, it was actually pretty good for a prequel. While it drags & is a whopping 147 minutes, it's a good film that's worth a watch. It's got good enough action in it along with some great characters, visuals & effects. But could've been shorter, faster paced & more vibrant.7/10.",
    "24": "Stale character development coupled with unauthentic facial expressions and acting make this movie flop. The first 10 minutes of the movie didn't have a strong hook and left viewers uninterested. The acting from the freshmen cast was not believable or compelling. I felt no connection to any of the characters, and felt that the character development could have been better. Ziegler's performance was not up to par and they weren't able to convey a story in a genuine manner. This movie lacked balance in art, action, and attraction. I had higher hopes for this film because I loved the original trilogy.",
    "25": "Was this a worthy prequel? No. How many times did I check the time throughout? Around 20. Unbelievably slow and boring. Lack of chemistry between 'Lucy Gray' and Snow, was genuinely quite confusing watching their relationship. Why did Snow turn evil? Actually unsure. So many plot holes. The hunger games were extremely hard to watch, so gory and unnecessary. Could not stand Lucy Gray as a character, she weirdly kept breaking into song. NO comedic relief whatsoever. All characters were poorly developed, and for the most part unlikeable. Costume design felt really poorly executed, all of the costumes for the 'poor' felt very inaccurate, looked like they had gone to a fancy dress shop and asked for Aladdin clothing. Also why was Lucy Gray playing what looked like a very expensive guitar. Extremely inconsistent as some parts felt modern and some felt extremely old- fashioned. The 3 parts to the movie were poorly split and it honestly was so long for really nothing much to happen, was very choppy. Only good part was Snow being extremely hot.",
    "26": "I came into this movie with low expectations hoping to have my socks knocked off. But they are still very much on. Ziegler's acting and accent was bad no other way to put it just plain bad. The story was hard to buy into. The chapters almost felt like loosely connected but widely under developed stories that to do properly could have each been a movie on their own. It's a very basic see it once and say you have seen it. Several parts of the movie felt like they wanted to be rated R but were dumbed down to make a pg13 movie I'd also give a parent warning my daughter wanted to see it which is why we went and it was VERY dark for PG13.",
    "27": "After hearing everybody saying how much they enjoyed this movie, it makes me like it that much less. Regardless of how not into the hunger games I am, I can still recognize a well put together movie, and this movie just wasn't well put together. Aside from me not knowing much about Snows background and how that leads to the other hunger games movies, the movie is just extremely boring and honestly I think it's really bad acting as well. The characters seem to try to over exaggerate their emotions and I think again that has a lot to do with the bad acting as well as the actual action in the movie is just boring.",
    "28": "What confused me the most about this movie is how they spend millions of dollars on scenes, cast and costumes but they give Snow the most horrible, poorly made wig that looks like it was bought at Walmart for Halloween.The performance of the main actress was terrible, overacted and not very credible. Yes she sings well but we return to the same thing,\nWith that budget couldn't they get someone to act like a real actress and also sing?The movie was unnecessarily long, with too many characters. The character of de Columbia Gaul\nShe was ridiculous, like a caricatured villain, meaner than Gargamel, she just needed to laugh out loud while she caressed a cat and told her evil plans to a lackey.",
    "29": "I read a review of this before I went to see it and it began with the line 'too much singing' I thought - what an odd thing to write - then I went to see it and guess what ? Too much singing - thought it was gonna be a musical once she sang up at the reaping - so disappointing - cheapens the film - also - film never seem to be able to chart the ruse from young person to murderous dictator well at all - the Annakin Conundrum almost - Snow is just too inconsistent - angry one scene And full of compassion in the next one - I don't buy the journey to the Snow we know from the films or the books - let down.",
    "30": "This movie genuinely bored me to tears. I love The Hunger Games series so I was pretty excited to see this movie. I was aware that this film was going to be a more dialogue heavy kind of thing but it was just unbearable. The pacing was awful and it just went on for so long. I'm fine with movies on the longer side but not when you're forced to sit there and watch paint dry for 60% of the movie. I also did not care about any of the characters or their well being. I had no reason to feel emotionally attached to any of them. By all means do what you want and check it out but for me it was a huge yawn. I wanted to walk out of the theater but I sat through it all unfortunately.",
    "31": "Watching 2h 38min was as long as it sounds. The beginning looked promising: the yet undeveloped execution of the Hunger Games, the whole scenery or the introducing of Snow as the anti-hero who never actually despises the idea of the Hunger Games but still is human, empathetic and caring. There was some sort of character shift towards turning evil (like the scene he admits killing this one tribune felt powerful), but it never really got to a breaking point. Nevertheless Tom Blyth was the perfect choice who did a great job at what the writers gave him - which was way more than what they did to build a proper love story. Lucy's and Snow's romance felt forced, rushed and unconvincing.Which brings me to the biggest problem the film has: Rachel Zegler. Her acting was so poor I couldn't grasp any personality traits of Lucy Gray who should have been the strong woman on the outside but scared woman on the inside. Instead, her whole presence drowned in arrogance which didn't stop even after Lucy just experienced the most horrific days in her life in the Hunger Games Arena (like shouldn't she suffer from PTSD?)\nZegler has absolutely zero charisma that watching her felt exhausting. She definitely is a gifted singer - as the movie shows us several times - but that doesn't compensate her complete lack of acting skills. On the contrary, the more she sings the more the movie turns into these unnecessary and irritating musical episodes of any CW show.So if you are a fan of the original Hunger Games movies, you will definitely found enjoyable moments - if you already dislike Rachel Zegler before watching this movie, I would skip it.",
    "32": "Hollywood has become addicted to sequels and sequels and sequels. Hunger Games. Star Wars. Twilight. Harry Potter, ad nauseum.There was no good reason to make this movie, except for the money. And sure it will bring in enough money that the makes will call themselves justified.The only decent sequels came from Tolkien's LOTR. The script was good, the acting was good, the sets were good, the cinematography was good. Though Peter Jackson went overboard on the script at times but what he produced was worth watching.They should have stopped with the first film. Hunger Games was somewhat watchable, though I think Jennifer Lawrence was overrated as an actress. One movie was fine, the rest of them were merely indulgence.",
    "33": "I genuinely don't understand why people rate this as a masterpiece. I'm a big hunger games fan, and granted I haven't read the book, the movie was really dull. I don't know whether the book was depicting the same thing or not but I thought that Rachel's perfomance carried no emotion at all. She didn't make me care for the character at all. She's also surprinsingly close to Katniss with mannerisms, which ended up looking like a cheap cosplay rather than anything. Also, having her breaking into songs every 20mins, which imo didn't add anything to the movie half the time just made this even duller.The small arena part felt somewhat useless, almost like it wasn't part of the movie, few kills, then just hiding away defenceless and winning solely by breaking into song? Lmao.Also, it might just be me but having \"Lucy grey\" shouted every 5mins, without any alterations like just \"Lucy\" or \"miss Grey\" I don't know, it just got on my nerves a little bit, especially in the last scene with the trees.I have a hard time understanding why a film with quite a good cast felt so numb. It didn't feel useful at all. It felt like a fan made rendition of the hunger games with a high budget. It felt rushed, unfinished, unpolished. I had such big expectations for this movie as I wanted it to be of the same standard as the other films but it just wasn't, at all.",
    "34": "First, I want to emphasize that I have read the trilogy and watched all the movies.The books, although written, perhaps excessively, in simple language, are easy to read and provide decent entertainment, standing out like a lighthouse amid the vast sea of worthless fiction. On the other hand, the movies based on the trilogy are so powerful and energetic that they have turned Katniss into a symbol.And now, a few words about this movie:\nMy expectations were, rightly so, enormous-at least 7, maybe even 8 stars. After just half an hour, it became clear to me that this film is simply a waste of time-nothing substantial! Boring, slow, and overacted. Those interested in the series should watch and stick to the movies based on the trilogy, and skip this one. I definitely recommend the books as well (I haven't read this one yet, and probably won't after the movie).",
    "35": "Because of the good reviews, I thought I'd take a chance on this. It was surprisingly entertaining except it seemed they couldn't find a way to turn the young Snow into a villain without an idiot plot point.Everything made sense until he was sent into the ring to save his friend. He asked his superior to send in the \"peacekeepers\" but was told that the cameras were on and the public didn't want to see them in there. Then the young Snow was told that the cameras would be off when he went in to retrieve his friend so there would be no record of his entering the ring. After he went in, he killed one of the contestants out of seeming rage though, at that moment, he had more relief at safely retrieving his friend than anger so powerful that he could kill someone.Those 2 idiot plot points allowed him to lie to his girlfriend and ultimately lead her to not trust him and leave him. Had he never killed that contestant, he would have not had an opportunity to lie to his girlfriend and they would have escaped to the north, free. There would never have been a grown up mean Snow, thus no future Hunger Games movies featuring Snow.The other troublesome part was how, when the young lovers stumbled upon a cabin, how was it that the guns made it in there before they got there? And how did she know the guns were in there?So, there were a few things that, i think had they cleaned them up, would have made for a really great movie. As it was, what they ended up with was a movie that was a better than expected sequel (that is a prequel.). So i gave it a rating of 6.",
    "36": "I enjoyed the original Hunger Games movies and especially since I thought President Snow was one of the most interesting characters. I didn't read any of the books, so I didn't compare the movies to them. But I hope that the book this movie is based on was better than what was presented. My major beef is that the characterization of Snow gave us zero insight into what made him what he was in the future. The acting is good, but the characters are mostly unlikeable. Things are just thrown in without any thought to cohesiveness. Yes, the actress who plays Lucy Gray can sing and the atmosphere was definitely reflective of the capital and the districts, but for the most part the story and Snow were hollow. Just average to bad entertainment.",
    "37": "The Lucy Gray character is so thin... one second she's singing like it's Broadway, one second she's talking empty words about life, one second she's being emotional for no reason. Also, that best friend of Snow? There is not much logic behind his moves except just trying to be dramatic.In terms of the hunger game itself, WAYYY TOO WEAK! I know they are trying to show that Snow made hunger game the way they are in 1 and 2. But man it was weak back then! In my opinion they've written Lucy to be too good. Can you run just a little faster?!It's a long movie and I can barely seat through. To sum it up, way worse than 1 & 2.",
    "38": "I don't even know where to start. I was so excited that there was a new Hunger Games only to be surprised by how horrible it was. All the singing made it super cheesy like it was Disney movie, and it started to feel like a musical. The acting was horrible, the storyline was not engaging at all, which led to boredom throughout the movie. It dragged out forever and there were many times that I looked at my phone and was irritated that there was so much time left in the movie and nothing interesting had happened. The original Hunger Games was intense and had you hooked within the first five minutes of the movie. This movie was dry and I had no real direction that made sense. It was a total flop and I wouldn't waste your money.",
    "39": "No of course Katniss isn't in it. The singing is integral to the story, how can you complain about it? It seems many criticisms people are writing about this movie are simply due to individuals not understanding/processing the plot of the film and making judgments based on a lack of comprehension.This movie is a worthy addition to the Hunger Games franchise, satisfying the one question I had coming into it: Why is Snow such a psychopath?Additionally, we get to see another (old fashioned) Hunger Games which we've been waiting for, for nearly a decade!Having not read the book before seeing this film, it really enlightened me to information surrounding the society of Panem that I was previously unaware of / ignorant to.Not a perfect film, but a very good one nonetheless. 8.5/10 at least! I pray there's more to come from Suzanne Collins' mind.",
    "40": "Wow!!! I have been looking forward to this since the book came out, hoping it would be turned into a movie! They truly knew what to keep in the movie, what to adapt and what to leave in the book. Absolutely fantastic! I'm so happy and I loved every second of it. The actors did an amazing portrayal of the characters and the movie had great pacing and flow. As soon as it finished I would have happily stayed in my seat for a second viewing. You could watch this as a standalone but you do get more out of it if you have seen the other movies. You can see all the ground work and you get insight into many characters as well as the creation of the system and how it grew to be what we see in The Hunger Games.",
    "41": "I was a bit mislead when i thought The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is gonna be about the early days look of the game, but instead it's actually about Snow and how his 'innocence' ends. Although I enjoy how brutal and violence this film is, it lacks of thrill, little to no action, and have a weird amount of singing scene.... and for what reason?Blyth did a good job portraying Snow and his characters is well written, while Zegler's character lacks of charm and borderline cringe. But i guess kudos to her for trying. The third act pace dropped dramatically, while feel rushed at the same time with some unclear plot point and abrupt end.7/10.Lackluster, but i still enjoyed it.",
    "42": "I'm not a fan of \"The Hunger Games\" series. I watched the entire series just because I love Jennifer Lawrence. I haven't read the books either. In terms of content, it had an intriguing subject. I did not care when I learned that a new film was in the works and that it would be a prequel. But I still wanted to see it in a movie theater. I had no expectations for this film, but I believe it is not a bad film. It was even better. I like it. In comparison to the original films, I believe this one is the best. The plot was intriguing, and the acting was excellent. I do not particularly like Rachel Zegler; I do not think this role suits her, but she was not bad either. Her voice is very nice, I agree. Overall, I liked the movie.",
    "43": "As a dedicated fan of dystopian narratives, it pains me to say that the much-anticipated recent Hunger Games adaptation is nothing short of a letdown. Despite high expectations, the film fails to capture the essence of Suzanne Collins' gripping trilogy, leaving audiences yearning for the intensity and emotional depth that defined the source material.From the moment the opening credits begin, it becomes painfully evident that Rachel Zegler's Hunger Games is marred by a sea of cringe-worthy performances that even the most forgiving viewer will struggle to overlook. The cast, including Zegler herself, delivers a collective display of wooden acting that undermines the gravity of the dystopian world they're supposed to inhabit.",
    "44": "While some of it can be tied to the book, they very much rush through the film just to get it out while the book is hot. They skip key details, rush through the district, and change the ending to many key factors such as how she wins the games. The acting is also subpar except for Coryo, the actor did a great job. Overall this movie was boring and not true to the source material. The aesthetic also did not fit the timeline (set in future) making it seem so far into the past. Some tributes are dressed like they were on the cast of Newsies. Do yourself a favor and skip the theater and just stream it later. Not worth the hype.",
    "45": "Really sad that we've waited all this time for another hunger games movie and this is what they put out. The movie had great promise with the idea of a backstory of Snow but the need up turning into some corny Disney musical.I get they tried to show the betrayal that turned Snow into what we was but forcing a quick love story just made it that much harder to watch. The only time me and the family woudk get remotely excited was when they would reference something from the other films.Had so much promise in the beginning but I truly do feel like it ended with the singing. The acting was horrible as well. We couldn't stand watching Zegler for some reason would just get under our skin. It tuned us into critics instead of trying to enjoy this movie (which we couldn't).",
    "46": "I watched Catching Fire right after seeing the newest Hunger Games movie and it made me realise what I was missing in it. The emotions. The OG cast gave stellar performances, eveybody was cast perfectly and conveyed what their characters were going through. The Ballad felt somewhat empty. None of the characters were compelling enough. I found Lucy Gray to be too perfect, her relationship with Snow was rushed and lacked depth. The supporting performances were also mediocre, nowhere near as good as Haymitch, Effie or even tributes like Rue. In a minute of watching Catching Fire I felt more emotions than in the whole Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. It's unfortunate since that's where the strength of this movie should have lied. It is obvious that the games themselves aren't that entertaining to the audience anymore after watching the trilogy. Therefore, Ballad had a lot of potential for character development and conveying the story, the relationships between characters and the chemistry between them in the end...just wasn't there.",
    "47": "Having read the book less than two months ago it was more or less fresh in my mind. And to be fair it was a pretty faithful adaptation. There was some stiff left out but what was left out I didn't care too much for. There were a lot of positives. Great preformances on all front, especially from viola Davis who was the show stealer in my opinion. Corlionas and Lucy grays dynamic was just as good In the book and sejanus is portrayed just as much of an annoying twat as in the books. The soundtrack was really good too and Rachel zegler has an amazing voice. Jason schwartzman is great as lucky flickerman but he's no ceaser flickerman. My biggest issue is the pacing. It could have been a lot better. I wouldn't have been annoyed if it was split into two parts. The first two parts had pretty minimal issues but the last part felt really rushed. Still, snow lands on top is honestly one of the best ending lines ever. 8.7/10.",

They have changed a few things, but i can see why and the movie is still a very good adaptation. Suprisingly, my boyfriend, who was so annoyed that he must go with me to the cinema for this one, ended up liking the movie ( rated it 8.5 ). I think the start od the movie was the worst part and the best one was part III. I also didnt like Rachel singing, but besides that she was a good performer as Lucy. Also kinda hoped for more Tigris. I think the movie is important (the same with the book), because there are some things we dont think that much about in day to day life. Such us war, violence, betreyal, power and importance of trust.",
    "49": "\"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes\" is a good film that, as a prequel, managed to interest me in its story without having first seen the other films or read the \"The Hunger Games\" novels. The production is of a spectacular level, the script divided into three acts is effective, the first is dramatic and manages to generate sympathy with the main characters, the second act has good action scenes and manages to have good tension that makes you worry about the characters, but the third and last act is weak, slow but has well-directed dramatic moments. The performances are good, highlighting Rachel Zegler who also shows off her voice in several songs, and Viola Davis brings to life a unique character. The cinematography is not excellent but it does its job. The music composed for the film is its greatest success, highlighting the dramatic, action and suspense scenes.

Rachel Zegler is a good singer and did a phenomenal job bringing Lucy Gray to life. Tom Blyth was an excellent choice for Snow. You're able to see every emotion cross his face as he endures so much throughout the story. I'm very happy with the film overall and I highly recommend taking the time to watch it.",

Honestly, that is a big factor of the book that is missing. The love for the character. Personally, I really feel as Rachel's current controversies and backlash going on in the world. She should step back for a moment. She needs to think on her choice of words and understand where the fans are coming from. We are the ones that consume, so shouldn't that be a factor.",

The inner turmoil and conflict that the two leads feel throughout the film is very powerful, as well as the outer turmoil and conflict that is happening throughout the events of the film\n3) The production of the film was really high class. The cinematography, score etc clearly had a lot of budget and effort put into themNEGATIVES:1) I did find the film a bit too cringey at times.

Also Snow's classmates were all just cliché bullies which felt cringey and predictable\n2) The end felt very rushed to me, despite the film being over two and a half hours it still felt like it needed more time to wrap things up properly. Snow and Lucy Gray becoming enemies felt out of nowhere and the film leaves more questions than it answers. What happened to Lucy Gray? What are the after effects of Highbottom dying? What happens with the seeming conflict between Snow and Tigriss?3) There were too many references to the original series that felt far too on the nose.

Dramatic elements are heavy, intrigue abounds, politics play their part, and the action sequence provides a hefty dose of tension.Actors/Actresses were the highlight of the film for me, with captivating believability, emotion, and expression. Directing was a close second. CGI was obvious but not as off-putting as earlier 2000s films. A few questionable events at the end were head-scratchers and overall think the film would've been better finished at the climax rather than the downward slope. Still, a very enjoyable movie.",

    "66": "The movie was pretty good overall - and much better than any expectations for a prequel given the recent history of movie franchises trying to milk more money out of a successful trilogy. The cast is well-done and the story overall isn't like Hunger Games 2 where it was just more or less a replay of Hunger Games 1. I like how the background is constructed in a way that gives information without going through endless boring plots and side plots of characters that aren't memorable.I would have given it a 9/10 (tying my rating for the original) if the ending was better linked to the first Hunger Games. While, a lot is implied by how the movie ends. I would have liked more linkage on Snow's health issues in the Mockingjay movies where he had poisoned himself in order to poison and kill all his enemies. Whether it be by the way he did in this movie or some other method, there should have been more hints that he was willing to hurt himself to wipe out all his enemies. Unless they are planning to make a sequel to the prequel, I think they could have added about 5 minutes of screen time to explain how exactly he became President Snow.",
    "67": "Despite the haters, I will recommend this film to everyone who wants to see a complex mystery story with a unique narrative line. I haven't seen a movie in a while that stays with me outside the cinema and makes me think about the events in it.It's unpredictable, and the ending is genius because it excludes the basic happy ending and immerses you in the life and feelings of the main character. There are many ways to debate the decisions made by the protagonist and the reasons for his actions, exploring his motivations and emotions.Genius acting, performance, and filming as well.Have a great day/night!",
    "68": "I saw The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes, starring Tom Blyth-Billy the Kid_tv, Robin Hood_2010; Rachel Zegler-Shazam! Fury of the Gods, West Side Story_2021; Viola Davis-The Woman King, Law Abiding Citizen and Peter Dinklage-Cyrano, Game of Thrones_tv.This is the origin story of Coriolanus Snow-Donald Sutherland's character in the original movies-so it is a prequel that covers how he came into power. Tom plays Coriolanus, a student rising in the ranks in the Capital. Viola is the President of Panem, with Peter as her next in command. The 10th annual Hunger Games are starting a new season and Tom has Rachel as his volunteer-the Capital calls them tributes. Tom is her mentor in the games but begins to have feelings for Rachel and wants her to actually win, which is not what Viola wants, so they tend to butt heads over protocol. FYI: In case you are wondering about the sub title in the name, Rachel likes to sing-hence the nickname Songbird-and Viola has a 20 foot tank of snakes that she has been experimenting with and uses them on occasions, when necessary. It's a little slow in parts but overall, it's a good origin story.It's rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing material and has a running time of 2 hours & 37 minutes.I would probably buy it on DVD.",
    "69": "The portrayal of Snow's rise to power was intriguing, unraveling the influences that shaped him into an evil dictator. However, the absence of exploration into Lucy Grey's character, possibly related to Katniss Everdeen, felt like a missed opportunity. Initially thinking Snow was her father added to the confusion. The focus solely on Snow's story left Lucy Grey's role largely unexplored, and her country-like singing style seemed out of place, disrupting the movie's flow. The film's pacing felt extended, making it dull and failing to engage with some characters that should have received more attention. This ambiguity made it challenging to define whether the movie leaned towards drama or adventure.",
    "70": "First off- the initially mixed reviews on this shock me. I am admittedly a large fan of the first four movies, which is why I was equally as excited and scared to see this film. It did not disappoint. Excellent plot throughout, and it did an amazing job translating the book into a movie. If there was anything negative to say it would be I wanted a little more backstory, but I still thought every character was great and well acted. From start to finish it doesn't have any weak moments, and each scene feels like it has a purpose. This installment connects well with the other four movies, and honestly I just hope we might get a another at some point in the future.",
    "71": "This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. Tom Blythe absolutely slayed young Snow. This will definitely get him a lot more major movie roles. The acting, the plot, the twists, everything was spectacular. The writing was odd in some places but it's so few that it doesn't affect much. The cast was good. Peter Dinklage did good as always. The was actually one of the better prequels to an already established franchise. I did not have high hopes for this because I didn't want to come away from the movie disappointed. If you are a fan of the original Hunger Games movies than you will enjoy this. Don't listen to the bad reviews. You can please everyone and some people are extremely hard to please.",
    "72": "Absolutely the weakest instalment in the series and mostly that's down to Rachel Zegler's rigid staring-into-the-mid-distance acting and incessant singing. The story is ok, I mean it's Snow's origin story mixed in with what seems to be unremarkable filler. There are some good moments, few and far between, I was feeling pretty bored half way in and was hoping it would end, but no, it goes on... and on. Overall the dialogue is pretty rigid and unnatural, the plot is a bit of a mess, the acting is pretty bad from most - Rachel Zeglar especially cannot act. It might have been passable if they'd replaced her with someone who didn't do a Zoey Deschanel staring gurn all the damn time. Poor and missable, if you have over two hours of spare time my advice is watch something else.",
    "73": "I had heard many mixed reviews about this film, but since I am a fan of the series, and reading the book when it came out, I decided to give it a shot and I was not disappointed.The film is very faithful to the book, although the first part felt a bit off the side to me, I thought the film as a whole flowed well. The acting felt rather irritating at first, but I got used to it within the first part. Another con I found was that I also thought it would've worked better if it was a TV Series. There would've been more of an opportunity to actually go into depth about each character, because it didn't feel like we actually bonded with any of the characters, apart from Sejanus but even then in the end he turned about to be a bit of a jerk.Although I found it enjoyable, definitely too violent for a 12A, but the screenplay was entertaining, the cinematography was good. Worth a watch if you're a longtime fan.",
    "74": "Even for those unfamiliar with THE HUNGER GAMES, this film is often engaging. Knowledge of the series adds depth to the film. The titular games provide plot momentum ans suspense. Once the games end, the film's forward trajectory meanders. The performances are outstanding.The story of Coriolanus Snow, years before he would become the tyrannical President of Panem. He is handsome and charming, and though the Snow family has fallen on hard times, Coriolanus sees a chance for a change in his fortunes when he is chosen to be a mentor for the 10th Hunger Games only to have his elation dashed when he is assigned to mentor a girl tribute named Lucy Gray Baird from the impoverished District 12.",
    "75": "Where to begin. It felt like torture, nothing makes sense, because nothing has any meaning of any sort. The scenes, the cinematography and the dialogue feel like a 10 year old made the script and put it together overnight. The actors tried their best, but its not their fault the movie is absolute garbage. It was sad to see Peter Dinklage's talent get wasted on this movie. I think the worst part of the movie is how slow and un-interesting everything was.There was so much potential, and after 11 years from the original 2012 movie, this is absolutely pathetic sequel or prequel.Don't recommend to watch even if your life depends on it.",
    "76": "I couldn't wait to see this. I read the book & loved it. But It was honestly the worst movie I've seen in a while. It was so choppy, didn't explain why anything was happening really (everyone with me who hadn't read the book, was so lost - esp towards the end). I was so frustrated. I knew what was going on because I read the book. But I still got confused watching this movie. There was NO chemistry between Snow & Lucy - they didn't spend enough time on developing their relationship. The ending was a rushed mess. Truly Very disappointing. The Only bright spot was Tom Blyth as Snow - he was excellent.",
    "77": "I read the book a few months ago and I absolutely loved it. With a certain image in mind, I expected some kind of visualization of my own thoughts in the movie, which is kinda dumb to expect, but man oh man I didn't get disappointed. It felt like the book all over again. They let out some minor details, but it feels right and complete and easy to understand for everyone who hasn't read the book yet. Rachel Zegler and her incredible voice made her look and sound like Lucy Gray from the book, which is really hard, and she sang it all live on set. Can't recommend the movie and the book enough, go see it in the cinemas.",
    "78": "Wow! I'm so impressed by everything about this movie, the acting, the camera work and of course amazing costume and makeup. It's a perfect adaption from the film, doesn't really leave out any characters or important details. Some characters are gone from the book but you don't think about it at all and nothing is missing.In the beginning I admit it's a little quick with everything that's happening but I think that's a choice and I agree with it for most part. A really great detail is also that it is divided in parts and that's really cool according to me.All actors are amazingly cast and they do a really good job. The one person that totally steals the show is of course Viola Davis, terrifying and amazing in every scene.Tom is stunning as a leading man and he really embodies Snow in all that he is.I want to recommend this movie to everybody and I can't explain my love for it.",
    "79": "I have seen the movies with Katniss and I liked them. This one not so much. I did not like the female main actress. Her acting was not loveable and I just did not believe it. Why did she have to sing?The writers have been up and down in every corner to make links between this movie and the movies before, but the links could easily be forgotten as well.There were so many flaws and ideas that made no sense at all, like the birds who could copy human voices with a device. What was up at the end of the movie? Since this is a prequel, what kind of effect did it have for the other movies? Was Katniss Snow's child?The only plus was the male actor. But he could not carry the whole movie on his shoulders. This movie is just a waste of my time. It was better if I wasted on Napoleon, but can't go back can I?",
    "80": "I was pleased by this movie. This movie was probably the darkest Hunger Games yet, likely due to its more archaic technology used relative to the previous films. The acting was goods. Say what you want about Zelger, but her acting in this film was definitely a highlight. This film also gives us a better look at the function and reasoning behind this autocratic government, which is build under the principle that \"humans are inherently violent, and we need to be reminded of who we are.\" This movie is not flawless though. There are 2 major flaws with this movie: 1) An overly confusing plot, and 2) Subpar story arcs. The plot was a lot like Oppenheimer, where it is a 3 act structure, yet the most action happens in the second act, and the third act is the aftermath. With Oppenheimer though, it at least remained grounded through the entire movie with its philosophical and ethical questions. In this Hunger Games movie, the third act seems to diverge into something really weird with not much direction, and it really only makes sense when it is over. Now to Snow's story arc; it is completely lopsided. This movie is supposed to be a villain origin story, yet we see him as a protagonist all the way until the very end, with not much really much leading up to it, other than maybe a few warning signs. Lucy Grey's story arc is dull too. Why does she just all the sudden leave and try to kill Snow? Her purpose really was as a prop to Snow's already flawed story arc. There doesn't seem to be that character that you can really follow. Overall though, it is a good movie that is definitely worth a watch. The story is gripping, the villain is absolutely crazy (the scientist), and the dystopian themes are very convincing where you almost find yourself rationalizing the tyrannical government.",
    "81": "No matter how faithful a movie is to the book, it can't save itself from the fact that it's unneeded. Backstory to snow is fine if it adds something new to the universe, however nothing new is added here, we get taught everything we knew about the world and get tiny little snips of backstory of the origins of the Hunger Games. For the movies insane long run time, the final act of this film seems like a race to get to the end of the story. The slow paced world building it creates in the first two acts is immediately thrown out for the purpose of reaching that finish line. Unlike the last Hunger Games movies being split into two, this is the Hunger Games movie that should have been split into two. We don't get to the motivations and reasonings behind characters other than a line or two then we arrive at them. Another hour and a half of story telling could have fleshed these characters out and made the ending more meaningful. However we're left with a film that doesn't seem to ever end, masked with good acting, set design and great cinematography. But a film that is messy, long and drawn out only to be shot into a moc 10 speed at the end. Leaving this movie feel completely unnecessary.",
    "82": "I don't know where to start this review as I am just exhausted. Watching this movie felt like a Hunger Games trial.I guess I'll start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of this series. In fact, I didn't even watch all of the films until just a couple of years ago during the COVID shutdown, and I never thought any of these films went past slightly above average to above average. I'm sure the diehard fans would greatly disagree, but it is what it is.So The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, is it the epic that this film seems to be shooting for? Well, to that question, I answer with a resounding no.As the credits rolled and I was looking up scores and reviews for this film, all I could think was, \"What am I missing?\" The positive scores and reviews just puzzle me. Now I didn't think this film was trash because there is some good content here but dear oh dear for a film that is close to three hours but damn near felt like four they didn't take time to do anything.At it's core we are expected to truly love and care for the two central characters Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth) and Lucy Gray (Rachel Zegler). Despite both Tom Blyth and Rachel Zegler's efforts, I just couldn't care. Blyth and Zegler gave really good performances in their respected roles but their relationship just felt so rushed, and while I may not care for her person I cannot deny that Rachel Zegler is a talented actress and she does have a beautiful singing voice. She gave a great singing performance as she did in the remake of West Side Story, though not all her songs were that good, and some were just out of place. Her singing, in my opinion, felt more in place during the third act.But that's genuinely what I think holds up this film, the cast. The supporting cast in particular, with Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis being the absolute standouts in their supporting roles, and that's probably because those two characters were more interesting to me than the others. While the rest of the supporting cast gave solid performances, the characters themselves were just either poorly written or didn't have enough screen time to become important. Now I understand, for the most part, these characters are to serve as canon fodder in the arena, but for a film this long, you could at least try to make me care for a character or two.Now for The Hunger Games itself, the titular event. I don't think there has been a more boring Hunger Games. Soo much was going on, but nothing was happening. You'd think the event that is the films namesake would carry more thrill, tension, or drama, but none of that was here. Mostly due to the fact that I just didn't care for any of the tributes, and that's because they bullet trained to this event. Granted, there were certain moments leading up to this sequence that were interesting, particularly the scene in what looked like a courtroom or meeting room where they discussed The Hunger Games and how to make them better. But none of this worked in making me connect to the other characters.Also, this film is more about Snow and his relationship with Lucy than the Hunger Games itself, which would be fine if that relationship was executed properly. I mean, you have the time. You literally gave yourselves the time, so just use it.By the conclusion of the second act, all I could think was, \"There's more?\" The third act, fortunately for me, did garner most of my interest. That's just because I loved the idea of seeing Snow getting back what he lost. It was like watching a dollar store House of Cards, which is a shame because it could've been great, but once more, they didn't take their time. Instead, they really rushed through Snows character arch and cheapened it. I was actually enjoying the whole third act as I genuinely loved the concept that they had here, but it was botched in execution.Finally, after all this, is there at least a satisfying conclusion? No. If this film is supposed to connect in some way to the first Hunger Games, then that ending was terrible. Now I haven't seen the first movie in a long time but I don't see the connection if there is one. This will lead me to say that this is the films biggest problem. They are clearly wanting to tell a prequel story that I feel they want to span into a prequel trilogy but with no guarantees of being able to do that they try to fit everything in one film and it just doesn't work. Because of this, it made me feel like I was watching multiple movies in one when I'd rather watch one movie that sets up a trilogy than watch a single movie that's trying to be a trilogy.Well, I'm going to wrap this up and say that while I didn't hate this film, I definitely didn't love it, and as I mentioned before, there is some good content here. Perhaps with better direction and maybe some better writing, this film could have truly been something special. I will, at the very least, say this was a pretty movie, and it did look good on the big screen.PS. If I had a nickel every time Snow shouted Lucy Gray!IMDb: 4/10\nLetterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.",
    "83": "My wife and I watched The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (2023) in theaters last night. The hunger games are struggling to maintain viewer interest so they decide to undergo rule changes, challenging mentors to guide their tributes to success. Young Coriolanus Snow believes he has a winning plot with a talented singer from the 12th district...Directed by Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) and featuring Rachel Zegler (West Side Story), Tom Blyth (Billy the Kid), Viola Davis (The Help), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and Peter Dinklage (Game of Thrones).Regrettably, this installment is the weakest in the series and a significant letdown. Despite potential in the writing, Viola Davis delivers a stellar performance, while Rachel Zegler's acting feels rigid and unnatural, lacking authenticity. The writing falls short with average songs, dragging scenes, and a reliance on CGI, particularly in the water bottle and building collapse scenes, which appear cheesy and ridiculous. On the positive side, the villain shines, and the unpredictable evolution of Snow is outstanding. The final scene in the woods, however, disappoints after a brilliantly set-up sequence. The absolute final scene almost redeems the film by closing the premise perfectly.In conclusion, it's best not to continue with any more Hunger Games films. This one falls flat. I would give it a 5/10 and only recommend it to diehard fans unafraid of potential disappointment.",
    "84": "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a prequel to the Hunger Games film series. This film is directed by Francis Lawrence, who also directed the last three Hunger Games films.Young Coriolanus (Tom Blyth) is assigned as the mentor of tribute Lucy Gray Beard (Rachel Zegler) from the poor district 12. Coriolanus must prepare her for the popular Hunger Games.During these training sessions, Coriolanus learns about the dark side of the Capitol and what kind of danger the tributes actually face during the Hunger Games. He tries to help Lucy Gray as much as possible, but this can sometimes get him into trouble.This prequel could be entertaining for fans of the Hunger Games film series. Through this film they can learn more about the history of the world and the younger life of President Snow. They show so well how this older world worked and what the technologies looked like and worked at the time.In addition, the prequel seems a bit unnecessary, because in addition to the extra lessons you can learn as a fan, the film offers little new or special. The film also remains on a familiar side and brings little new with it, except for some light history lessons. As a result, the film can seem a bit long-winded at times. Especially due to the unnecessary, long running time of the film.The visual effects also seem less realistic compared to the better films in the film series. Later in the film it is more noticeable that the actors are acting in front of a green screen, which can sometimes take you out of the film. The CGI can also be seen somewhat. Furthermore, most of the weapons in the film do not always seem believable. This way they bring out less tension when the characters fight each other with these.Tom Blyth comes across well as a younger President Snow, but is still a bit at the beginning end of his acting career. Compared to Donald Sutherland, he tries to appear a bit lighter and friendlier as this character. Unfortunately, knowing how this character ultimately became this way does not provide much interesting information. Unfortunately, Rachel Zegler also delivers more standard acting. Especially when you start comparing her to Jennifer Lawrence. Jennifer Lawrence really managed to break through as an actress thanks to her acting in the old Hunger Game films.Supporting actors Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis provide the best acting. Viola Davis also shows that she had fun acting in this film. In the third, lesser chapter of the film, Burn Gorman provides the better performance as an army commander of district 12.",
    "85": "\"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\" is about as overlong as its title might suggest. It's a prequel origin story about the tenth Hunger Games and the character of President Snow of Panem; also known as Coriolanus Snow, played here to rousing effect by actor Tom Blyth.Another standout performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Casca Highbottom, whose character helps to explain how the games came into their early fruition.The film's story, based on the author Suzanne Collins' source material, pursues the humanising angle of exploring a younger and less hardened Snow as an empathetic figure - it's sort of like his Anakin Skywalker phase, pre-Vader.He partakes as a \"mentor\" to games contestant Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler). She's essentially an itinerant member of the Covey people who make their living travelling around and playing music; now settled in District 12 after the war.The story centres around Snow's fraught decision as to whether to pursue power, status, or love based on his connection to the Hunger Games, his strained social standing in the capitol, and his relation to Lucy Gray as her mentor.The film goes wrong when we hear far too much of Lucy Gray's singing. It feels like Hunger Games feat. MTV.She's a free-spirited character but this persona is driven home far too intensely for it to come off as natural. Her music is supposed to give her a spellbinding aura, but it's way overdone. Her jarring southern accent tries too hard to show her as that archetypal practical country belle filled with the warmth of her folkloric aphorisms. So, while she does have a certain warm charisma to her character, this heroine scarcely could hold a candle to Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.In other key plot points we encounter plot armour and plot holes. The plot moves along too easily because Coriolanus conveniently pulls off a cunning move or trick on more than several occasions. These are oftentimes things that would never slide in reality.The world itself is flush with sepia and monochrome. It feels like a good amount of retro, whilst keeping some technologies in the mix too. Sadly, the tenth Hunger Games themselves were an incredibly bland watch without anywhere near the suspense of the sequels.5/10.",
    "86": "It's been some years since the franchise have us Mockingjay Part 2, my interest peaked at Catching Fire, but slowly diminished as it went on, I thought this looked recent from that trailer, for me though this was a bit of a damp squib, it wasn't bad, it just didn't hold my attention, a film I just couldn't get into.I had a feeling the film would struggle without Jennifer Lawrence, and it really did, I had no issues with Rachel Zegler's acting, indeed I thought the was rather good, but I couldn't attach to hers, or any of the characters, I just found them all a little anonymous, and almost impossible to empathise with.A mixed bag in terms of production, I thought some of the visuals were great, some terrific special effects, but all of that music, it just wasn't for me, I didn't quite see the appeal.Do yourself a favour, go and see Saltburn instead, an infinitely better film, I did thr double, that captivated me, this one sent me to sleep.5/10.",
    "87": "I started the book but did not get far. And now after watching the movie I realize that I would have liked it probably even less if I had read the entire book. Probably the biggest problem is that none of the main characters seem likable or realistic enough in the world for me to root for them or have the emotional down-spiral of the characters to be a good tragic drama.There is sort of this 1950s steampunk aesthetic that also made no sense to me given that this is supposed to take place in our distance future rather than the somewhat recent past. How/why would TVs in the future start to become anything like TV screens from the 50s? Are they also going to reinvent laserdiscs?The way the hunger games unfolds makes it feel completely absurd that the winner would win even with all of the cheating. Also the 2 big dramatic scenes after the games just seems confusing. Especially intermixed with some of the other scenes around them. Maybe he works better with all of the perspectives and time that an author is given in a book. But it certainly didn't make a lot of sense to me.Stumbling across the guns later in the film seemed way too coincidental too. And the motivations of the main characters was so inconsistent from one moment to the next near the end that he started to seem bipolar and phycho. I don't think they sufficiently developed his character so one could understand why/how he would work so hard for power and control. The beginning had him challenged that power and control so much that it was a wonder why he would even want any power and control over a society that he just barely seemed to care about.All in all. It's a mess, but interesting to try to follow because it seems to be such a mess.The actors seemed alright. The music was good. The cinematography was fine. But the story and characters didn't seem well developed to me. And I was frequently wondering why these characters and this timeline was being presented given that it didn't seem to answer many questions compare to all the questions and problems it raised.",
    "88": "I have connected faster to characters in 40 minute tv show episodes than any of the characters in this 2 hour and 38 minute feature film. None of the characters are likeable, none of the characters have clear motivations - except Snow's friend, who constantly tells us that something is rotten in the state of Panem, in case the audience fail to connect the dots themselves.When the movie reached its conclusion, I had no idea what journey it was supposed to convey. If not for the pompous soundtrack (a dissapointing score by the otherwise great James Newton Howard - I think he struggled finding an emotional core in the screenplay) I wouldn't have known that the movie had reached the end, and our main characters journey towards evil was complete.And what the hell is it with all those music acts?! I know they are part of the book, but in the movie they are just annoying, mainly because the lead actress performing them sings like some cocky, pitch perfect dixie chick with overly theatrical facial expressions - resembling Jack Black at his most exaggerated.Katniss in the original movies felt grounded, real, vulnerable. Lucy in this one has no sense of purpose. She is just perfect, powerful and righteous from the get go, leaving no trace of dubiousness, no space for development, and thereby, no reason for the audience to connect with her. She feels like a plot device on Snow's journey towards darkness, with absolutely no chemisty between her and our antagonist to be.What a waste of my time.",
    "89": "I will start by saying I don't think it's an 8, maybe a 7.5-7.7 so I rounded up.However, I went in with low expectations, expecting a big budget movie with a poor storyline but otherwise reasonably watchable. Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself hooked! And I daresay it was one of the better Hunger Games movies.The bad reviews I've read seem to miss the point. This is not a story about the origin of the games, it is not a story about 'Lucy Gray\" (even though her name is said about 1000 times)... It is a story about Snow and why he became the psychopath we know from the original stories. I found the not-so-happy ending refreshing and if you enjoy and understand social economic/philosophical dilemmas in terms of human psychology then it adds a notch of appreciation.Viola, Tom and Peter were excellent in their portrayals. Zegler was fine, a little theatrical but given her background I suppose understandable.I don't understand the hate. Especially the 1-3* reviews. Like, what were you watching!?",
    "90": "Rating: 4.7\nOverall, a poorly executed movie as the direction and writing fail to build Snow up to be a bad guy to the point that they have to force this by the time the movie ends (making the first two acts of the movie feel pointless), but the movie is entertaining in the second act because they convey The Hunger Games well.Pretty Bad Direction (The direction on a macroscale is good as the director uses the large sets, VFX, and cinematography to help paint these grand scenes in both the capital and the arena of The Hunger Games (while at the same time showing its grime and dark side), the direction of The Hunger Games was good and kept the movie engaging in the middle part; the direction on a microscale was bad as the interpersonal scenes did not feel fluid at all and were not well executed; the direction of actors was bad as none of of the performances felt like they were elevated by direction; storytelling was poor as there doesn't feel like a sense of where the movie is going as builds to one thing and drastically disposes of it in favor of a something else), Decent Acting (Pretty Good from Tom Blyth (Shows some range of emotion and shows both the good and the bad side of Snow decently well), Pretty Bad from Rachel Zegler (Her accent kept on slipping and she kinda feels out of place with the rest of the cast (and the chemistry between her and Blyth is not the best); her musical moments (while forced) were carried out well as she shows off how good of a singer she is), Pretty Good from Peter Dinklage (Really just feels like he is playing many of the characters he has played in the past (the drunk character who has a lot to say) so he kinda just goes on his own), Good from Jason Schwartzman (The best performance of the movie as he plays the comedic relief character well), Pretty Bad from Hunter Schafer (Very emotionless and doesn't have any emotion with Blyth), Decent from Josh Andrés Rivera (Has moments where he shines and some moments where it feels like he's overacting), Decent from Viola Davis (Not really her best performance as it is a lot of overacting (but it doesn't feel like it is a bad performance, just not the best direction)), Decent from the rest of the cast (Hard to comment as most of the cast is child actors who feel like they weren't given the best direction)), Bad Story (The concept was pretty good as it was interesting to see the early Hunger Games and the origins of President Snow (though the carrying out of this concept was very bad); the story contruction was terrible as first act drags so much that its boring and the third act is completely out of place as it felt like they forgot to make Snow the bad guy (the second act is pretty good as its just The Hunger Games and plays to the strengths of the franchise); storytelling/flow between sequences was bad as every scene just felt forced and nothing felt like it flowed between each other (and this is especially seen in the final act as the movie has to make up for making Snow be the good guy when hes supposed to be the bad guy; character writing was very bad (Snow is terribly written as they put so much emphasis on sympathiszing him and making him be the good guy that they run out of time in making him be the bad guy and rush/force this part of the character in the end, Lucy Gray Baird is not written either as you really don't cate about her as her singing just gets really annoying towards the end), Pretty Bad Screenplay (The dialogue did not flow and was kinda forced; the tension build was good and carried out well in The Hunger Games act; the symbolism was very shallow as it does not do a good job in building Snow's journey for power; the foreshadowing was none-existent as the movie forces the ending because they forgot to make Snow the bad guy in the first two acts), Good Score (Carries different motifs from the original franchise), Good Cinematography (Helped show how grand the capital was and helped build the world (especially in The Hunger Games)), Good Sound (Helped in the action scenes), Good Editing, Good Visual Effects (Helped make the movie feel like it was a part of the franchise and did not feel over-the-top in any way), Good Production Design (Helped with building the world), Plot Structure was the biggest issue for the movie as 2 out of the three acts were pointless (the first act builds Snow to be a good guy and really drags, the second act is pretty good as it is just The Hunger Games, and the third act is just so forced as it clearly shows that they forgot to make Snow the bad guys so they rush to give him moments that show how he's not a good person); The movie could've been split into two movies to help with runtime (with the entire third act being spun off to show how bad of a person Snow is as there are some moments in the second act that could allude to him being a bad guy, something a second movie could take and build on), Pacing was slow in the first and third act (especially in the third) but pretty good in the second act as the fast pace helped build tension in The Hunger Games, Climax was so underwhelming it was more laughable than entertaining, Tone was very similar to other Hunger Games movies.",
    "91": "We watched this at Imax last night, and it was just terrible.I don't know what I was expecting, (because I really don't like Rachel Zegler or her acting), but it certainly wasn't this.Although Zegler was unsurprisingly cheezy and awful, and although for some odd reason they made this film into a semi-musical which made everything feel awkward, I was still somewhat hopeful that the film would eventually improve..but it never did.It remained boring the entire time.Look, I genuinely like the Hunger Games over-all, but the prequel was so uninteresting, and the characters had so little chemistry or depth, or explanation, that we were truthfully almost bored to tears...and I'm actually surprised we were able to finish the film without walking out.🤷‍♂️ 🙄",
    "92": "The Hunger Games return and I'm not sure whySure, I was exited as any to return to this universe and have some fun. While I'm not the biggest fan of the original movies, I still see them as very entertaining. The problem here is the lack of focus and missing some really easy focus points. This movie is really easy to save by simply focusing on one of the storylines more, but it derails itself by being more or less 2 movies in one, and I would have preferred this to be split so we really got a situation where we could dive deep into the world and it's characters instead of a surface level look.Coriolanus Snow is a young man training to become leader of the capital. He and his fellow classmates are assigned to make the 10th Hunger Game more interesting by making the contestants famous before fighting.The biggest issues with the movie to me is the aforementioned lack of focus. The movie is very easy to fixed by focusing on some of its elements more, since they are actually interesting. Making a movie about the first fame Hunger Game is such a good idea. What went right and wrong, how would they turn the people and the ideas, and some of these elements are here, but are never in the forefront. The same could be said about the journey of Snow. He has to turn into something, but that journey is not clear or well-made. The first half of the movie his barely in focus, and by the end, the journey he makes in the second half doesn't match the first. It's a mes. Even the romance aspect is rushed. The movie wanted to do too many things at once, and the result makes a movie that is barely about the things it's about.The characters also lack depth and story to really make us care and root for them. Snow's character is poorly explained, since everybody goes along with his idea, even people in power! Why? He's a kid! The lack of emotions and attachments really got to me, and it bored me.Because the movie becomes boring. It got to a point where I simply didn't care anymore. It goes from one thing and derails into its own sequel, and without the focus it feels uneventful, and it becomes too long, split this movie into 2 with more focus, and you have 2 decent movies.There are some good performances and shots though and some really gripping scenes, some involving guns, some with mockingbirds, it's interesting that the movie feels this well-made while the script doesn't, I think the grandness despaired for me. The Hunger Games isn't big yet, and it can be felt. It seems more boring and lifeless, and that's the point, the problem is that we, the audience, also fell that.I also need to question the Katniss moment from the first Hunger Games. It bothers me that she started a rebellion when she did. In this movie, there is even a Katniss type character doing a similar event to hers. Why didn't that start a riot? Who knows.While some of the performances are good, the dialogue is terrible and the actors don't have a lot to work with, sadly. It makes them look bad, but it's easy to distinguish that it's not the actor but their material.This movie with a way too long title is a mess. I really wanted to like it and while there are elements I did like, the story told just simply didn't grip me at all. It was a boring and too long experience, and the problem for me is that I can see the easy fixes, which means the team missed it somehow.",
    "93": "If there's one popular franchise that I can't seem to like, it's the Hunger Games franchise. None of the films gave me something wonderful and so special that it left such an impression on me. This new release doesn't deviate much from that. It is again a very weak film that fails to develop a story in a captivating way. This actually occurs during the middle of the film, where most of the action scenes take place. The film as a whole always seems to drag on, but part 2 is much better than the rest precisely because it escapes this tiring pace that doesn't go anywhere. Part 3 is where it gets even more tiring. The film always seems to be coming to an end, but it never ends. The beginning and middle seem not to be connected with the end. It feels like you're watching two movies and it ends up being even more unbearable. There are many problems in the development of the story as a whole, especially those of some important characters. It's a mediocre film that doesn't deviate from the franchise's standards. It's not the worst, it's not the best. It is a film that becomes forgettable.",
    "94": "7.6/10This is my first time being introduced to the world of \"The Hunger Games\" and I will say that I was pleasantly entertained. I don't know what to expect from here on out, but I hope to be as entertained, if not more, by the original movies of the series.The story was engaging and separated into three parts that made it enjoyable. Everything from the introduction of the Games to evasions to conclusions were well executed. Despite the film being violent prone it still comes across as tense and deadly without showing anything too gruesome to maintain its PG rating.The acting was strong. The actors were well suited for their roles, and only based on trailers, I found the young Snow builds well for the original movies, but unknown for certain. I loved the chemistry between Rachel Zegler and Tom Blyth.The music was terrific. Zegler has an amazing voice, and her songs obviously work well into the film. The visuals are mostly incredible. There's a few spots where it's very obviously screen acting. Part of me hopes they did have physical sets cause there were portions that felt genuine.Overall, you don't need to have seen the previous films to understand what's going on, but it may help to better understand who the characters are. Acting is strong, music is great, and the story is amazing enough to make me want to see the rest of \"The Hunger Games\".That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",
    "95": "This movie was so disappointing, there was just something missing across the board. Acting was okay but none of the actors had chemistry, the stakes didn't feel very high at any point, and the singing was both excessive and borderline comical in timing. The movie preached many times that viewers need someone to root for and someone to hate, whilst simultaneously doing the exact opposite by giving us neither.What made the original Hunger Games great was that you believed in the characters backstories, and you could get drawn into it. Snow and Casca felt real, but everyone else somehow felt like a caricature of a person. Kudos to both of these actors who did a phenomenal job, it just somehow wasn't cohesive with the other characters who felt somewhat 2-dimensional.Lucy in particular felt over-acted and I struggled to root for her - the chemistry with Snow falling particularly flat. Did I mention the singing was insanely overdone? In contrast, the brief screen time that Clemensia and Snow shared felt far more genuine and intriguing, and I would've liked to understand her and Snow's friendship more.Overall the movie felt messy and lacking in heart. I had been so excited for this movie for so long and was disappointed at how disconnected it felt. Whilst I understand that singing is woven throughout the book, this felt like one of those things that in a movie felt out of place. Perhaps it was the way it was acted, I'm not sure, but even as low budget as the 1st Hunger Games movie was.... I felt connected to the characters and their journey, which was not the case here.",
    "96": "I guess this is just what Hollywood has come to. I always expect more, but no. The audience still get treated for what we are to them; cold cash.It's hard to say where this movie went wrong, because not much went right, really.The movie is set in the amazing dystopian universe created by Suzanne Collins, that the first 2 Hunger Games movies could, to a fairly high degree, do justice.Unfortunately, this movie does everything but. The storyline is scattered all over the place, none of the characters are remotely interesting and the writing is just... oh man. Stop singing!!!The only two good things to say about this movie, are:\n1. The production value is high (kudos to the people trying to do their job, even when the state they work in is way below their standard).2. Some of the actors do a good job, considering the scripts they've been given. Tom Blyth and Viola Davis are the two main names here.Unfortunately, the singing Rachel is also in the movie, so you kind of forget that some of the actors actually try to do a good job.Needless to say, I won't be wishing for any snow this winter.",
    "97": "\"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes\" attempts to explore the origins of a notorious villain, President Snow, but ultimately falls short in its execution. While the concept of delving into the past of such a complex character is intriguing, the narrative feels sluggish and fails to deliver the depth and intensity expected from the Hunger Games universe.The portrayal of a young Coriolanus Snow lacks the compelling depth needed to justify his transformation into the iconic antagonist of the original trilogy. The pacing struggles to maintain engagement, with stretches of the story feeling drawn out and disconnected. Additionally, the dynamic between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray Baird, the tribute he mentors, lacks the emotional resonance required to truly invest the audience in their relationship. Rachel Zeigler acting sucks as well.Moreover, the exploration of the early Hunger Games lacks the gripping tension and moral complexity that made the original trilogy so captivating. Instead, it feels more like a diluted version, missing the edge-of-your-seat excitement and the thought-provoking commentary on society and power dynamics.Overall, \"The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes\" fails to live up to the standards set by the previous Hunger Games installments, offering a lackluster portrayal of a compelling villain's origins and missing the mark in terms of both storytelling and character development.",
    "98": "\"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes left me feeling like I was stuck in a bizarre dystopian version of American Idol. The story wanders around like it's on a quest for purpose, centering vaguely on two characters who seem as lost as I was trying to follow the plot. And then there's Rachel Zegler, popping up like a musical fairy godmother every 5 minutes. I half-expected her to break into 'Hunger Games: The Musical' , anyone?The film's attempt to weave a compelling narrative feels more like attempting to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded - confusing and with no clear resolution in sight. The decision to turn it into a pseudo-musical only adds to the bewilderment, leaving me wondering if I accidentally stumbled into a Capitol-sponsored talent show.Rachel Zegler's constant musical interludes make you question if she has a secret contract to ensure a song every 300 seconds. It's like the filmmakers discovered a 'Sing for Survival' clause in the Hunger Games rulebook. I can't decide if it's a desperate attempt to inject life into the story or an unintentional audition tape for 'America's Got Talent.'The storyline is as elusive, full of plot holes. It's like they dropped a bag of breadcrumbs in the woods, and we're left wandering in circles, trying to make sense of the narrative maze. The movie's plot is more twisted than the Capitol's fashion choices, leaving me with a sense of confusion.In the end, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes feels like a failed attempt to remix a dystopian classic. It's not a symphony of storytelling; it's a cacophony of confusion with a side of unwanted musical numbers. If the Hunger Games were a competition for viewer endurance, this movie would win hands down. May the odds be ever in your favor if you decide to give it a watch - you might need it.\"",
    "99": "I saw this movie on opening night. I have not been able to stop thinking about it since... I read the original trilogy but never got around to reading the prequel but decided to just see the movie. Rachel Zegler receives hate because of a comment she made about a completely different movie (Snow White), and it's completely irrelevant to this movie. She performed more than beautifully in this role. She is a classically trained soprano, and was singing beautifully in her chest voice and with a really good twangy accent (which is more of a mezzo/alto type of singing in this case). From one classically-trained singer with a degree in music who performs for a living to everyone out there afraid to give this movie a chance because of all of this biases against this young woman- SHE IS GOOD! This girl is talented, and the hate is stupid.This movie was by no means perfect, but it was really good. I would have thought it was a perfect 10 if the action was better paced. It was nothing on her part. Definitely not as good as Catching Fire (the peak of the series to me), but better than both of the Mockingjays! Give it a shot without a bias of this young women in your mind and you just might find yourself enjoying it ;)",
    "100": "Incredibly disappointing, and here's why:\nToo much content and story forced into the movie, making it rushed and, at times, quite messy.Hardly any likable characters; didn't get to know any of them particularly well and certainly didn't sympathize with them.Too much singing.Some props, costumes, and elements threw me off, making me forget this was part of the Hunger Games universe. It felt more like a drama romance from the present time, especially in the second half of the movie. Some characters seemed oddly 2023-like, despite being set hundreds of years into the future. Rachel Zegler, in particular, just \"looks\" Gen Z.Viola Davis, the queen, in a cheap costume and with an even cheaper manuscript.The other Hunger Games movies were like an emotional rollercoaster, whereas this movie left me uninterested and little invested. I was really not looking forward to feeling \"nothing\".",
    "101": "This film is the definition of a split personality. It's called Hunger Games but you only see something like that in it's first half hour, since the filmmakers had the bright idea to escalate the film in it's first act, putting the first act as the second act and then the third act as the second. Are you confused? Well, look at them! The result is that you think the movie is ending but it eventually takes a \"break\" and resumes in about five minutes. I am addressing to you Hollywood movie makers: beginning?, middle?, end?, world building?, exposition?, protagonist testing?, twist?, climax? Don't they remind you of anything? The movie ends and you don't know what you've seen, you are confused. Where is the catharsis? Who is good and who is bad in this movie? I didn't know whose side to take and when the viewer doesn't know whose side to take he's lost.But yes the movie has some positives (thankfully). The soundtrack, cgi and color grading are very good but it's such a shame that these were wasted in a festival of bad script and direction. It's hard to believe that Francis Lawrence has directed this film. Oh and if you're going to turn it into a musical halfway through you'd better tell us from the start.It's unbelievable and sad what is happening in modern Hollywood. They're just trying to make money based on strong and beloved franchises by changing them and throwing in minimal work. The only instances of them coming up with anything worthwhile yet are those of the known greats in the game like Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, Cameron, Villeneuve, Tom Cruz, etc.",

I really wanted to leave the cinema, and would have if I hadn't come for once with my daughters.Once half way you start hoping: \"ah finally the last plot twist, now the movie can stop... \" and then a new story starts, totally new, out of the blue, little to do with what happened before, they could have gone in 50 directions, and just picked one, for fun of spending money on making movies or so? What a waste of my time and money...\nThe main actress even sings up to 3 or 5 times the same song, you'd think it has become a musical, but no no, that was just another plot twist.After a while your only hope is to see some nice fighting scenes, but even there the movie disappoints...\nI try to find one positive aspect... well, maybe the fashion, the clothes...

    "103": "Despite the disappointing ending to the saga in Mockingjay Part 2, that did not prevent us from continuing to explore the universe of The Hunger Games further. This prequel focuses on Snow's beginnings as a humble young man who questions the methods that the Capitol uses to discipline the rebels, but throughout the film he discovers the truth about what human beings are capable of. All through his relationship with Lucy Gray hoping to regulate the methods of the Capitol. Unlike the previous films, this is a longer and more dramatic story that does not focus solely on the Hunger Games, but mostly on Snow's transmission. It is a worthy installment that serves as a prologue to the saga, even without the presence of Katniss Everdeen. It has that metaphorical characteristic that has always defined the saga with respect to capitalism, social inequality and what human beings are capable of doing by instinct. Rachel Zegler gives a spectacular performance in many ways, including her musical numbers. There is no doubt that The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a great film that revives the saga again and is a good option for those who do not know the saga to begin to enter this apocalyptic universe created by Suzanne Collins. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.",
    "104": "There's more substance in a vacuum than in this movie. The writers are clearly unmotivated and decrepit. Their work stinks, and the director put the final nail in the coffin.This is the sort of movie one would expect from one's teenage son after gifting him his first camcorder and clapperboard combo. Little Jimmy went off to play with his friends and came back with this rubbish.The actors should seek alternative employment, and the producers should just move to Florida and forget all about life. As for the audio people, they seem a lost cause entirely. The audio quality of this movie was terrible. Don't studios that invest millions of dollars in movies check for basics such as the sound quality?This is another movie that puts me off new movies. I'm just going to watch old black and white flicks for a while, and I'll check back on the new stuff after the bad memory of this rot has faded a bit, and in the hope that Hollywood has past its dead years and has started making movies worth watching again. What a horrible experience.",
    "105": "How can a movie from a great franchise like hunger games be this bad!!I mean they could just copy paste the previous ones and make a better movie than this trash.1- acting was so bad, i felt nauseous watching them. The worst was zegler and the rest would follow her on the list\n2- hunger games used to be fought in visually pleasing environments, this one was in a dark theatre?? I mean how lazy they were that couldn't come up with a better location.3- lighting was so bad, i thought i was watching Batman2022, i had to put the brightness on max just to see their shadows moving around\n4- characters development sucked big time, didn't feel a thing for anyone of them\n5- too slow, too dull , too directionless, too pointless\nI could name at least 10 more negative points but i feel this movie doesn't deserve more of my time.Do not watch it if you respect yourself.",
    "106": "I am not the biggest fan of the Hunger Games franchise. I don't hate it, but I've never found anything all that likeable about it. It was, and still is my opinion that the Hunger Games are the weakest execution of the battle royale concept in all of film and television. So naturally, I didn't really have high hopes going into this movie.The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is split into 3 parts: the first, an introduction to Coriolanus Snow and his friendship with Lucy Gray; the second, the actual Hunger Games; and the third, the aftermath. I have to admit that I did find the first two parts somewhat enjoyable, albeit the obvious lack of any serious character development. It still had some charm and some wit about it to keep me interested, despite it feeling like the writers didn't really put in the effort to lay the foundations to make these characters live up to their full potentials.But all of that was nothing compared to how unbelievably disappointing the final part was. If you thought the character development in the first two parts were rushed, you're not ready for what the third has done. Characters are going through serious mental and philosophical transformations within periods that make it almost comical to watch, and through actions that just make no sense given the context of what has already been established. It was jarring and felt like it needed its own movie to flesh the action out to be consistent.This movie does nothing to change my opinion on the franchise. Maybe makes it slightly worse, but I could ignore it on a good day. For the fans of the Hunger Games and for those who care a lot about the series however, this movie could be a fun 150 minutes.",
    "107": "This one was seriously poor movie. Everything is either poorly done or then very overacted, over dramatic and pompous. Starting from acting, to costumes, to special effect, writing, everything, it was either poor or mediocre. It felt like I was watching an over length episode of a lousy stream series which is cancelled after the first season due to poor view ratings. Then some extra things like musical style singing to reflect the story with dramatic fashion was totally overacting and way too overdramatic. Just an example of weird decision to add extra drama into the movie. Everything felt so out of the place.Other reviews have also mentioned that the scenes were loosely connected. I also felt it was like that. Not to mention that it was very difficult to follow what really this movie is about. The story is so confusing. I had no idea after the movie that what the districts are there fore, what is the Capitol, what are these mean looking soldiers and how they fit into the concept of Capitol, what these hungergames are really for and so on. The amount of open questions was like vast. Then the sheer amount of talking with completely meaningless dialogue. Oh my God.After the second part, the movie is split into parts by the way, I was completely lost that what the story in the movie is actually all about. Then some story lines are concluded with super lame fashion. Just suddenly something is happening just for some reason to kill the characters so that the storyline can be concluded.This kind of movie makes me really think that how the movie industry is going so wrong with big budget movies. Somehow I believe that at 80s or 90s with this budget, people at the industry would had made something way much better. In this movie, there is virtually nothing spectacular, nothing to see explicitly at the cinema. This movie is a total filler into stream service catalog what you may watch into some point at home and then just close the movie because it's so lousy. Maybe stream services are killing the cinema industry inside out. Who knows...",
    "108": "'' The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes '' is a prequel to the '' Hunger Games '' series, following the events taking place before the main story, and explaining how the Hunger Games became the spectacul they ended up being. It is also based on the book by the same name, and, more or less, was a faithful adaption.As a whole, the movie is okay and has its moments. Though the costumes and the settings were just okay, the pace was nicely handled and the games exciting enough. The action scenes well also impressive. In addition, the songs were really good and Lucy Gray was spectacular.However, the story was rushed and the character development of Snow rocky and the few hints here and there left out for the viewer to determent Snow's character were not clear enough amongst the chaos of the games.Finally, the performances were enjoyable, but the leading lady was impressive.",
    "109": "As someone who read the book days before seeing this film, I can tell you it should've been in two parts. I did thoroughly enjoy it! However, there are so many things that they left out that I felt were integral to the story. In order to properly see Snow for who he is-a spineless boy who only does things that look good to others-I think they needed to spend more time with the character. I'm not usually a fan of two parters, but this one really should've been. The characters fell flat to me because we didn't get great looks into them.My boyfriend, who didn't read the book, really liked it and said he felt he understood the characters well enough though. So maybe it's just a me problem.Because so much of the book is Snow's internal monologue, I know it would've been hard to capture that properly on film, but I think they could've. Also, it's SO much darker in the book, and I think that was necessary for the audience to see.",
    "110": "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes lacks any subtlety in what the Hunger Games are truly about, allowing it to go further with those core ideas than ever before. The class divide has never been bigger and the desperation that makes people abandon all morals to ensure their success is such a clear through line in this story, even after the games are over.Whilst the film remains engaging throughout, the structure is a little weird. It's nicely divided into 3 chapters with two focusing on the games and one after which means the final third has to speed run Snow's growing villainy. The decision to keep it as one film was greatly appreciated however, either a slightly longer run time or splitting in two might have actually helped for once.Tom Blyth makes the role of Coriolanus Snow his own and is the only reason the complete change of character in the third act works, laying hints throughout that this side of him might have been there all along. Similarly, Rachel Zegler as Lucy Gray creates a character who's the complete opposite of Katniss (extroverted, loves performing) and her singing is incredible.Josh Andrés Rivera is the moral centre and real tragedy of the film, a character too pure for the world he's born into. Viola Davis gives such a cartoonish performance in a way only an actor of her calibre could pull off and Jason Schwartzman is the best. He's the only one allowed to have fun with it, delivering the only jokes and continuing what Stanley Tucci started.When it comes to franchise reboots it's usually not a good idea to bring back the same guy who did the last ones but returning director Francis Lawrence does a great job. The practical and CG elements are blended together really well and it's helped massively by Uli Hanisch's production design which crafts a more analogue world with a stripped down Hunger Games.Similarly, returning composer James Newton Howard does another wonderful job. Callbacks are kept to a minimum and replaced with some epic tragedy that compliments the doomed romance whilst once again communicating the brutality of the games in a way the PG-13 rating still can't.",
    "111": "The latest Hunger Games installment introduced a captivating concept, but its execution left much to be desired. Unexpectedly, certain scenes carried a whimsical Disney musical vibe, a stark departure from the series' gritty tone. The depiction of arena deaths fell disappointingly flat, lacking the visceral impact that defined the franchise. Moreover, the CGI work was subpar, failing to immerse the audience effectively.However, the film wasn't without its merits. A standout feature was the commendable ensemble cast, with each actor bringing a nuanced performance. Yet, some talents were sadly underutilized, leaving viewers wanting more from characters who had the potential for greater depth and development.One major flaw that overshadowed the positives was the rushed pacing of the narrative. The movie struggled to explore the intricacies of its intriguing concept thoroughly. A more deliberate approach, possibly as a two-part installment, could have allowed for a more immersive and satisfying exploration of the dystopian world.Despite its shortcomings, the film managed to maintain a semblance of the franchise's essence. The core themes of rebellion, survival, and sacrifice were present, but the execution failed to capture the intensity that fans expected. In essence, the latest Hunger Games installment had all the ingredients for success, but its hasty execution prevented it from reaching the heights of its predecessors.",
    "112": "Okay hear me out, I am a hardcore hunger games fan. I love the gritty, pure and raw four movies, especially the first two.This movie feels more like a cheap rom-com that happens to be set in Panem. Zegler is an insufferable pick-me girl that sings like the popular girl at your high school play. I know it says ballad in the title but that does not justify the commercial musical songs that are thrown in there to distract from plotholes.Blythe gets way too much screen time and nevertheless the character development from nice guy to evil Snow falls down from the sky like a dead mockingbird.It's a painful watch that made audience sitting around me cringe at their kissing scenes, because it all seems forced and chemistry is lacking.And why did the make up department decide to give Zegler a YouTuber 2014 Glam Up ? A girl from District 12, come you all can do better.This is nowhere near the previous movies. The extras did well though, a better performance than most actors.",

It plods along at a snails pace, and nothing ever happens.The acting is shocking even in it's best moments, you would think it's a cast of child actors with how hammy and fake their reactions are. The lead woman is just shockingly bad, almost like she is loading emotions when needed and you can see the loading times. Her random bursting into auto tuned song was so weird too. It never made sense, she just randomly sings and for some reason that saves the day every time.The leading male does an ok job but again not enough to say it's good enough.And eesh the story is just nothing at all. It's a movie where start to finish, absolutely nothing happens or has impact other than the 3 heavily focused maguffins which might as well have big neon signs pointing at them that they will shortly be used to move the glacial plot forwards.This feels like they googled a few key words from the originals and just crowbarred them into this abysmal movie. You can happily live your life as a hunger games fan having never seen this tripe.",
    "116": "A reoccurring thought throughout the movie for me was It felt like a movie plot that was so easy to sell. If they had to convince studio executives to green light the movie, or convince the actors to take the role. Describing the plot to someone makes it more interesting than the movie actually was. It somehow just doesn't culminate into something special.I was, in the slightest sense, excited for this because I'm a sucker for dystopian films. Starts off very dark and gloomy, depicting a war torn landscape and giving off an aura similar to that of the original hunger games movies. However we get to see this from a different perspective from those, we get to see it from inside the Capitol. I think it's good that it's made by the same people, so it felt consistent with the franchise. World building was great visually speaking, you still get the same classism and hierarchy and politics, but now from the inside. Not from the victims eyes but oppressors.Feels more more of an introduction to this world than I expected it to be, because we already knew the premise of these movies. I think it could've been better showing us the inaugural hunger games, not the 10th.I think it could've worked better if it didn't have a lead role, instead of it being Snow's background/origin story, (which I don't think was necessary) it could've been the hunger games themself's origin story. They were already a thing at this point. Loved seeing the origin of the \"hanging tree\" song though.They could've given Rachel Zeglar more to do, it felt like all they wrote her to do was sing. Oh she sings here, she sings there, she sings everywhere. Felt more repetitive than impactful (maybe it's because I'm not the biggest musical lover lol). Viola Davis was great, you can put her character up there with Amanda Wallis, just insane cold hearted characters. I wonder what happens with her Dr Volumnia Gaul character in the future. Peter Dinklage didn't have as much time as I expected but he made the most of it. Acting was great throughout the cast. Burn Gorman shows up in the last act, seems like he's made for such type of roles also. Type casting.I wish they didn't shy away from the gore and violence, but it was pg13 and action was still decent. It's not as quick paced but it's okay. Never had me at the edge of my seat as I expected. The one thing that actually annoyed me was there were so many moments when I was literally screaming \"run\" at the characters and they took so long to react.It is pretty long, but a lot happens to fill up the time. I liked that they divided it. The crappy thing is knowing that Snow survives, removes some thrill from it.I think it should've been better and more captivating. They had enough material to work with but it's just not as exciting. The characters weren't as easy to root for, I thought Rachel zeglar was great and did the most she could've done; but I just didn't feel taken in by her the way Jennifer Lawrence made katniss. She wasn't someone to root for and felt forgettable. It felt like they could've given her more to work with.Tom Blyth's portrayal of Snow was excellent, yet knowing the eventual transformation of the character into a tyrant in the future might have impacted the viewing experience. The attempt by the writers to hint at this evolution felt inconsistent with the character's present age and personality. It might have been more effective if they depicted him as a villainous, power-hungry individual masquerading as good, or just straight up good and thrown all their eggs in that basket. Instead, the portrayal fluctuated between moments of genuine goodness, power-hungry actions, and conflicting motivations. At times, he prioritized his family, while at others, he pursued power or seemed invested in his affection for Lucy Gray. The character's motivations seemed muddled, making it challenging for the narrative to balance these conflicting traits effectively.It wasn't the rise of snow, it was just his childhood, but they still wanted us to see the Snow we knew, if this was a trilogy I'd assume they couldve shown us the evil side of him in the sequel. That could've better and more easily shown good character development and arc, while it felt too squeezed in here.The movie is broken up into three parts and you'd expect them to be building up to something, but the last third is dull. Doesn't get better the more you watch it. And how it was separated made it feel like i was binge watching a series, which I think would've been a better adaptation than a movie. Someone said it felt like two movies in one because they were unsure of a sequel could happen.I think it's an okay entry to the hunger games franchise, it's a decent foundation for sequels but it just feels like it wasn't made the best it could've. It feels like an unnecessary reboot. It's not too bad but it's pretty far from being anything special, just lingers around being little better than mediocre for me. However I am still excited of what they can do from here with the sequels.",
    "117": "I was not a huge fan of the original trilogy. I'd rate this slightly below the others, but not too much.It's the curse of sequels and prequels I suppose, and with that in mind it actually wasn't too bad. Most of the cast does a decent job - With the big names (& small person) carrying most of the weight.Rachel Zegler, however, has ruined all movies she will ever play in.One cannot unsee the arrogant, snide and nasty person she revealed herself to be. It's embedded into everything she does now.She has massive reputational damage, along with Disney.It will take a long time and lots of effort to undo.",
    "118": "In the near future \"Big Brother\" has evolved into \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\" is the first prequel, set 64 years prior to \"The Hunger Games\" in a city being rebuilt after a civil war destroyed the Capitol of Panem and obliterated District13.It too is based on a novel written by Suzanne Collins, who also wrote for the Hunger Games trilogy.The director in charge of \"The Hunger Games\" franchise since 2013 is back, and Francis Lawrence has pulled heavily from the novel.As President Snow (Donald Sutherland) reminded us in the series many times before and again in this telling, \"It's the things we love most that destroy us\" and this will make even more sense in the movie.The legend that changed the game Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth as a bleached blonde) is a mentor and we watch his change from a person of integrity who steps across that line into evil.At one point in the movie his curly locks are shaved GI Joe style and he's a dead ringer for Eminem.It's only fitting because in this period of his life he loses himself (pardon the pun)...at least his old decent self.Snow has plenty of evil role models including \"Dr Casca Highbottom\".An ironic name considering he's played by Peter Dinklage...one of the finest actors of my generation.And the other antagonist Viola Davis as snake breeding \"Dr Volumnia Gaul\" is pure evil...both inspired casting.\"Tigris Snow\" (Hunter Schafer) is Mr Snows only surviving cousin from the Dark Days and there are hints at her fashion designer flair in this movie, of course in the last part of the trilogy Snow tires of his relative and forces her to be tattooed like a Tiger, but she gets her revenge.Every tribute has a story and the main Tribute is Rachel Zegler as \"Lucy Gray Baird\".In fact, she is the same age that Jennifer Lawrence was when she portrayed \"Katniss Everdeen\" when the first Hunger Games movie was released.There are a few nods to the Games original heroine \"Katniss\" in this prequel including her curtsy and a wild flower bearing her name.Lucy loves a singalong...hence \"The Ballad of Songbirds\" subtitle and at times I though I was watching an episode of \"Glee\" (just shoot me now).Every saga has a beginning\nIn this Games there's so many clues this is decades before the original Games movies were set with older technology in TV Monitors, cameras, architecture and even Peace Keepers uniforms (they don't look like Storm Troopers yet).It's got a 50's America vibe, which will tap in nicely to the current retro trend of everything old is new again in 2023.Jason Schwartzman plays the first ever host of The Hunger Games as \"Lucky Flickerman\" (Weatherman & Magician) is a scene stealer with some of the best lines.He is of course part of a media family dynasty that includes Caesar Flickerman (Stan Tucci) in the original four part trilogy.While not as polished as his Grandson he reminds everyone to \"smile..that's why you have teeth\" something Caesar took to heart with his cheesy Hollywood smile.Yet again the drones play a part in distributing water and other much needed supplies to the tributes, but it's new technology and they need to iron out a few bugs in these deadly drones.Every movie lately is divided into chapters with titles superimposed on the big screen.I blame the rise of Audiobooks, but I shouldn't complain because I've narrated a few.Listen out for: \"Can't Catch Me Now\" by Olivia Rodrigo in the closing credits.If you want to know how quickly civilisation disappears you've come to the right movie.Everything is about winning in The Hunger Games saga and this origins movie is no different.Enjoy the show...all 2 hrs 37 Minutes of epic Hunger Games action, adventure and drama.This will be one of the smash hits of Summer 2023!You are invited to return to the Games which have been a welcome addition to our movie universe for over a decade.You just know Snow will land on top, but it's also good to see Snow fall.",
    "119": "At a little after two hours (out of 2 hours and 37 minutes of run time), I couldn't stand it anymore and with no end in sight, I left the theater before I fell into a coma. The 10th Hunger Games was the shortest, least interesting and unchallenging of all. I don't think the actual \"game\" even lasted 20 minutes. Gone was all the CGI, the different effects and terrains and all the out-of-nowhere things to challenge the players in addition to the tributes trying to kill each other. I found Rachel Zegler's character, Lucy Gray, annoying at every turn, shallow, not particularly clever, with no real depth or even a back story.

I normally applaud a film that has the balls to kill a kid. It's usually unexpected, and when done well, it creates incredible tension. In this movie, you're expecting kids to die, which somehow just adds to how distasteful the actual violence is. It's completely unearned. We've had random singing, terrible dramatic acting, scenes that feel like TikTok fan fiction, and everyone in the capital is twirling their moustache like a Bond villain. Whether the writers like it or not, this movie is WAY too campy to allow for this kind of brutal violence and social metaphor.I don't even really want to get into the last 45 minutes, or whatever it was. The main guy acts like a sociopath the entire film, and we know who he becomes, so I don't feel I'm spoiling anything by saying that he continues to be a sociopath, and everyone acts accordingly.

    "123": "I did not expect to enjoy this film.I am a fan of the hunger games franchise, I read the original trilogy of books and really enjoyed the first two movies, however since the realise of mockingjay part 1 and 2 movies, which were extremely lacklustre, I have completely lost all interest in the franchise and never paid any attention since.Therefore upon hearing about this new addition to the franchise earlier this year, I wasn't too bothered and forgot about it. Then I saw it was released, and just decided to go see because why not. I hadn't seen any trailers and knew nothing about it, just that it was based on a new book by Suzanne Collins.I had absolutely zero expectations, although the cynical part of me thought I might be wasting my time, especially after seeing the runtime on the movie. However, 3 hours later I can admit I left the cinema feeling rather impressed. I genuinely enjoyed it.While the hunger games trilogy we know with Katniss Everdeen strike me as a fun, rewatchable teen-fantasy, in the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, we see a much darker and grittier side of the world of Panem, which I felt resulted in experiencing a much more horrifying reality of the games themselves. It felt more real, and grounded, and loved seeing how everything operated with far more inferior technology and fewer established rules.Since watching the movie I've seen criticism of the characters and acting, and while I am usually quite strict on that kind of thing too, I genuinely see their points here. I understand Rachel Zegler is an actress of controversy for a lot of people, I myself have seen a lot of debatable interviews with her, but I believe she shows of her talent here with a great performance. The standout performance is definitely Tom Blyth and a young president Snow however, an actor who I have not seen in anything else before. I found myself genuinely caring about the fate of the two characters and their relationship, which is a hard thing to achieve, and i feel is the core element of this movie, therefore really enjoyed because of it. The supporting characters were also well performed, such as Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis.The movie is split into three chapters, like a book. Chapters 1 and 2 are certainly the stronger of the three, which I very much enjoyed for reasons already stated. Despite still enjoying chapter 3, and completely recognising it's importance, I feel as though it was slightly rushed, and therefore perhaps would be understood more by people who have read the book and have pre-existing knowledge of the hunger games.Although certainly not a flawless movie, I am pleasantly surprised by it and had a fun time watching. I would recommend if you fancy a movie night. 7.5/10.",
    "124": "This prequel presents a remarkable first part that successfully revives the compelling elements of \"The Hunger Games\" saga, evoking excitement through the portrayal of tributes, the inhumane Capitol management, and poignant metaphors. The smaller arena contributes to an intense atmosphere, maintaining a delicate balance between avoiding explicit deaths and ensuring a family-friendly rating. The contextualization of the early games adds an intriguing layer, highlighting the evolution from the initial to the final games in the original saga.The protagonists, notably Lucy and the nuanced portrayal of the young President Snow, add depth and memorability to the narrative. Despite limited development, secondary characters establish a connection with the audience, eliciting a range of emotions. The film introduces a darker atmosphere not present in the original saga, with memorable scenes like the eerie mockingjays repeating the last words before public executions.However, the second part, while interesting for narrative development, feels rushed, leaving room for a more thorough exploration of characters and consequences. This critique suggests that splitting the narrative into two films could have enhanced the depth of the second part, allowing for additional scenes to intensify the storyline. The justifications for President Snow's personality change, although present, are portrayed quickly and lack convincing depth. Despite these shortcomings, the film stands out for its impactful first part, rivaling or even surpassing key scenes from the original two films.",
    "125": "Snow - I know it is supposed to be Ice ... but as I am going to say no pun intended, I hope and believe you understand where I am going with that. That means you have to have seen the other movies too. This being a prequel - I assume you have seen the other Hunger Games movies, but this is the extent of me mentioning them - well going into details.Let me add that there are a few things in this (not just characters) that carry over. Some are connected to people in the new (old) movies and we also get to see origin stuff (how did that came to be and so forth). The acting is really good, the story is tight and the Games are just one small part of the whole thing. Actually you may be surprised about how much other stuff is being done and talked about. Winter may not be coming yet, but Snow is here ... and he is here to stay (well and go ... and come back ... and stuff like that! As always no pun intended here either).If you liked the other movies you will find something in this one too. I am not sure if this is based on a novel too (not just the characters, but the story overall), so as you can tell, I can not give you any scoop on how accurate it is to the writers vision ... maybe it's better to watch without any preconception of things anyway (?)",
    "126": "I've read the Hunger Games trilogy several times, including the audiobooks in anticipation of this film. I purposefully did not read the book for this movie, because I like to read the books after. While the rating seems good, I'm not understanding the large number of negative reviews.The Hunger Games is YA - it seems a lot of people are expecting something different. The school setting of the trainers and Viola Davis's character felt very appropriate for the genre, and so did the immature characters. The melodrama between them, and the general focus was exactly as expected. The movie has a PG-13 rating, so while it is a dark story, the violence is toned down. This is not Game of Thrones, despite Peter Dinklage being there. I suspect the lack of intensity might have been an issue in expectations for some. In addition, the games themselves are only one part, rather than the main focus of the film. This is not a sequel meant to relive the original trilogy. Those books and movies stand alone. That saga is complete.However, if you focus on the message and themes, much of the story is actually very striking. Snow is a realistic villain, which is exactly the point. It also occurs in the time of his life when these character developments really occur. He is never a completely sympathetic character because that would not be believable. From the beginning, we can see that he is strategizing more than caring, in contrast to many of his classmates, especially his friend, Plinth. In fact, he is a star mentor right away, attracting the attention of the head game maker, played by Viola Davis. The story is well crafted, and I'm so excited to now fill in the blanks by reading the book. There are indeed hints at unanswered questions.",
    "127": "It's hard not to compare this to the original but when I do it falls flat .I don't think Jennifer Laurence will be crying with jealousy .First off the singing .What was that all about ?It was totally unnecessary and very annoying .Speaking of annoying Rachael Zegler is very unlikable in this role .The singing and prancing around at the start of the film put me off.The story is very much all over the place and we're never sure what we are supposed to concentrating on.If you watch to see a hunger games movie you will be very disappointed.The ending makes no sense at all.I was very confused.The Snow character totally changes his personality for the final act .I was really looking forward to this movie and I was totally let down .I won't be rushing to watch the follow up .It could have been a masterpiece but what we got was a mess.I see people giving it a 10 or 9 on here which also worries me .There was a time when IMBD was the Bible of reviews .",
    "128": "I wanted to like this movie but it is easily one of the worst I have ever seen. It plods along at a snails pace, and nothing ever happens.The acting is shocking even in it's best moments, you would think it's a cast of child actors with how hammy and fake their reactions are. The lead woman is just shockingly bad, almost like she is loading emotions when needed and you can see the loading times. Her random bursting into auto tuned song was so weird too. It never made sense, she just randomly sings and for some reason that saves the day every time.The leading male does an ok job but again not enough to say it's good enough.And eesh the story is just nothing at all. It's a movie where start to finish, absolutely nothing happens or has impact other than the 3 heavily focused maguffins which might as well have big neon signs pointing at them that they will shortly be used to move the glacial plot forwards.This feels like they googled a few key words from the originals and just crowbarred them into this abysmal movie. You can happily live your life as a hunger games fan having never seen this tripe.",
    "129": "A reoccurring thought throughout the movie for me was It felt like a movie plot that was so easy to sell. If they had to convince studio executives to green light the movie, or convince the actors to take the role. Describing the plot to someone makes it more interesting than the movie actually was. It somehow just doesn't culminate into something special.I was, in the slightest sense, excited for this because I'm a sucker for dystopian films. Starts off very dark and gloomy, depicting a war torn landscape and giving off an aura similar to that of the original hunger games movies. However we get to see this from a different perspective from those, we get to see it from inside the Capitol. I think it's good that it's made by the same people, so it felt consistent with the franchise. World building was great visually speaking, you still get the same classism and hierarchy and politics, but now from the inside. Not from the victims eyes but oppressors.Feels more more of an introduction to this world than I expected it to be, because we already knew the premise of these movies. I think it could've been better showing us the inaugural hunger games, not the 10th.I think it could've worked better if it didn't have a lead role, instead of it being Snow's background/origin story, (which I don't think was necessary) it could've been the hunger games themself's origin story. They were already a thing at this point. Loved seeing the origin of the \"hanging tree\" song though.They could've given Rachel Zeglar more to do, it felt like all they wrote her to do was sing. Oh she sings here, she sings there, she sings everywhere. Felt more repetitive than impactful (maybe it's because I'm not the biggest musical lover lol). Viola Davis was great, you can put her character up there with Amanda Wallis, just insane cold hearted characters. I wonder what happens with her Dr Volumnia Gaul character in the future. Peter Dinklage didn't have as much time as I expected but he made the most of it. Acting was great throughout the cast. Burn Gorman shows up in the last act, seems like he's made for such type of roles also. Type casting.I wish they didn't shy away from the gore and violence, but it was pg13 and action was still decent. It's not as quick paced but it's okay. Never had me at the edge of my seat as I expected. The one thing that actually annoyed me was there were so many moments when I was literally screaming \"run\" at the characters and they took so long to react.It is pretty long, but a lot happens to fill up the time. I liked that they divided it. The crappy thing is knowing that Snow survives, removes some thrill from it.I think it should've been better and more captivating. They had enough material to work with but it's just not as exciting. The characters weren't as easy to root for, I thought Rachel zeglar was great and did the most she could've done; but I just didn't feel taken in by her the way Jennifer Lawrence made katniss. She wasn't someone to root for and felt forgettable. It felt like they could've given her more to work with.Tom Blyth's portrayal of Snow was excellent, yet knowing the eventual transformation of the character into a tyrant in the future might have impacted the viewing experience. The attempt by the writers to hint at this evolution felt inconsistent with the character's present age and personality. It might have been more effective if they depicted him as a villainous, power-hungry individual masquerading as good, or just straight up good and thrown all their eggs in that basket. Instead, the portrayal fluctuated between moments of genuine goodness, power-hungry actions, and conflicting motivations. At times, he prioritized his family, while at others, he pursued power or seemed invested in his affection for Lucy Gray. The character's motivations seemed muddled, making it challenging for the narrative to balance these conflicting traits effectively.It wasn't the rise of snow, it was just his childhood, but they still wanted us to see the Snow we knew, if this was a trilogy I'd assume they couldve shown us the evil side of him in the sequel. That could've better and more easily shown good character development and arc, while it felt too squeezed in here.The movie is broken up into three parts and you'd expect them to be building up to something, but the last third is dull. Doesn't get better the more you watch it. And how it was separated made it feel like i was binge watching a series, which I think would've been a better adaptation than a movie. Someone said it felt like two movies in one because they were unsure of a sequel could happen.I think it's an okay entry to the hunger games franchise, it's a decent foundation for sequels but it just feels like it wasn't made the best it could've. It feels like an unnecessary reboot. It's not too bad but it's pretty far from being anything special, just lingers around being little better than mediocre for me. However I am still excited of what they can do from here with the sequels.",
    "130": "I was not a huge fan of the original trilogy. I'd rate this slightly below the others, but not too much.It's the curse of sequels and prequels I suppose, and with that in mind it actually wasn't too bad.

    "131": "In the near future \"Big Brother\" has evolved into \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\" is the first prequel, set 64 years prior to \"The Hunger Games\" in a city being rebuilt after a civil war destroyed the Capitol of Panem and obliterated District13.It too is based on a novel written by Suzanne Collins, who also wrote for the Hunger Games trilogy.The director in charge of \"The Hunger Games\" franchise since 2013 is back, and Francis Lawrence has pulled heavily from the novel.As President Snow (Donald Sutherland) reminded us in the series many times before and again in this telling, \"It's the things we love most that destroy us\" and this will make even more sense in the movie.The legend that changed the game Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth as a bleached blonde) is a mentor and we watch his change from a person of integrity who steps across that line into evil.At one point in the movie his curly locks are shaved GI Joe style and he's a dead ringer for Eminem.It's only fitting because in this period of his life he loses himself (pardon the pun)...at least his old decent self.Snow has plenty of evil role models including \"Dr Casca Highbottom\".An ironic name considering he's played by Peter Dinklage...one of the finest actors of my generation.And the other antagonist Viola Davis as snake breeding \"Dr Volumnia Gaul\" is pure evil...both inspired casting.\"Tigris Snow\" (Hunter Schafer) is Mr Snows only surviving cousin from the Dark Days and there are hints at her fashion designer flair in this movie, of course in the last part of the trilogy Snow tires of his relative and forces her to be tattooed like a Tiger, but she gets her revenge.Every tribute has a story and the main Tribute is Rachel Zegler as \"Lucy Gray Baird\".In fact, she is the same age that Jennifer Lawrence was when she portrayed \"Katniss Everdeen\" when the first Hunger Games movie was released.There are a few nods to the Games original heroine \"Katniss\" in this prequel including her curtsy and a wild flower bearing her name.Lucy loves a singalong...hence \"The Ballad of Songbirds\" subtitle and at times I though I was watching an episode of \"Glee\" (just shoot me now).Every saga has a beginning\nIn this Games there's so many clues this is decades before the original Games movies were set with older technology in TV Monitors, cameras, architecture and even Peace Keepers uniforms (they don't look like Storm Troopers yet).It's got a 50's America vibe, which will tap in nicely to the current retro trend of everything old is new again in 2023.Jason Schwartzman plays the first ever host of The Hunger Games as \"Lucky Flickerman\" (Weatherman & Magician) is a scene stealer with some of the best lines.He is of course part of a media family dynasty that includes Caesar Flickerman (Stan Tucci) in the original four part trilogy.While not as polished as his Grandson he reminds everyone to \"smile..that's why you have teeth\" something Caesar took to heart with his cheesy Hollywood smile.Yet again the drones play a part in distributing water and other much needed supplies to the tributes, but it's new technology and they need to iron out a few bugs in these deadly drones.Every movie lately is divided into chapters with titles superimposed on the big screen.I blame the rise of Audiobooks, but I shouldn't complain because I've narrated a few.Listen out for: \"Can't Catch Me Now\" by Olivia Rodrigo in the closing credits.If you want to know how quickly civilisation disappears you've come to the right movie.Everything is about winning in The Hunger Games saga and this origins movie is no different.Enjoy the show...all 2 hrs 37 Minutes of epic Hunger Games action, adventure and drama.This will be one of the smash hits of Summer 2023!You are invited to return to the Games which have been a welcome addition to our movie universe for over a decade.You just know Snow will land on top, but it's also good to see Snow fall.",
    "132": "At a little after two hours (out of 2 hours and 37 minutes of run time), I couldn't stand it anymore and with no end in sight, I left the theater before I fell into a coma.

Gone was all the CGI, the different effects and terrains and all the out-of-nowhere things to challenge the players in addition to the tributes trying to kill each other. I found Rachel Zegler's character, Lucy Gray, annoying at every turn, shallow, not particularly clever, with no real depth or even a back story. I wish they'd just have focused almost entirely on the character of Coriolanus Snow, the mentor, who was very interesting and checked off all the personality points that Lucy Gray didn't.

I hadn't seen any trailers and knew nothing about it, just that it was based on a new book by Suzanne Collins.I had absolutely zero expectations, although the cynical part of me thought I might be wasting my time, especially after seeing the runtime on the movie. However, 3 hours later I can admit I left the cinema feeling rather impressed. I genuinely enjoyed it.While the hunger games trilogy we know with Katniss Everdeen strike me as a fun, rewatchable teen-fantasy, in the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, we see a much darker and grittier side of the world of Panem, which I felt resulted in experiencing a much more horrifying reality of the games themselves. It felt more real, and grounded, and loved seeing how everything operated with far more inferior technology and fewer established rules.Since watching the movie I've seen criticism of the characters and acting, and while I am usually quite strict on that kind of thing too, I genuinely see their points here. I understand Rachel Zegler is an actress of controversy for a lot of people, I myself have seen a lot of debatable interviews with her, but I believe she shows of her talent here with a great performance. The standout performance is definitely Tom Blyth and a young president Snow however, an actor who I have not seen in anything else before. I found myself genuinely caring about the fate of the two characters and their relationship, which is a hard thing to achieve, and i feel is the core element of this movie, therefore really enjoyed because of it. The supporting characters were also well performed, such as Peter Dinklage and Viola Davis.The movie is split into three chapters, like a book. Chapters 1 and 2 are certainly the stronger of the three, which I very much enjoyed for reasons already stated. Despite still enjoying chapter 3, and completely recognising it's importance, I feel as though it was slightly rushed, and therefore perhaps would be understood more by people who have read the book and have pre-existing knowledge of the hunger games.Although certainly not a flawless movie, I am pleasantly surprised by it and had a fun time watching. I would recommend if you fancy a movie night. 7.5/10.",
    "137": "This prequel presents a remarkable first part that successfully revives the compelling elements of \"The Hunger Games\" saga, evoking excitement through the portrayal of tributes, the inhumane Capitol management, and poignant metaphors. The smaller arena contributes to an intense atmosphere, maintaining a delicate balance between avoiding explicit deaths and ensuring a family-friendly rating. The contextualization of the early games adds an intriguing layer, highlighting the evolution from the initial to the final games in the original saga.The protagonists, notably Lucy and the nuanced portrayal of the young President Snow, add depth and memorability to the narrative. Despite limited development, secondary characters establish a connection with the audience, eliciting a range of emotions. The film introduces a darker atmosphere not present in the original saga, with memorable scenes like the eerie mockingjays repeating the last words before public executions.However, the second part, while interesting for narrative development, feels rushed, leaving room for a more thorough exploration of characters and consequences. This critique suggests that splitting the narrative into two films could have enhanced the depth of the second part, allowing for additional scenes to intensify the storyline. The justifications for President Snow's personality change, although present, are portrayed quickly and lack convincing depth. Despite these shortcomings, the film stands out for its impactful first part, rivaling or even surpassing key scenes from the original two films.",
    "138": "Snow - I know it is supposed to be Ice ... but as I am going to say no pun intended, I hope and believe you understand where I am going with that. That means you have to have seen the other movies too. This being a prequel - I assume you have seen the other Hunger Games movies, but this is the extent of me mentioning them - well going into details.Let me add that there are a few things in this (not just characters) that carry over. Some are connected to people in the new (old) movies and we also get to see origin stuff (how did that came to be and so forth). The acting is really good, the story is tight and the Games are just one small part of the whole thing. Actually you may be surprised about how much other stuff is being done and talked about. Winter may not be coming yet, but Snow is here ... and he is here to stay (well and go ... and come back ... and stuff like that! As always no pun intended here either).If you liked the other movies you will find something in this one too. I am not sure if this is based on a novel too (not just the characters, but the story overall), so as you can tell, I can not give you any scoop on how accurate it is to the writers vision ... maybe it's better to watch without any preconception of things anyway (?)",
    "139": "I've read the Hunger Games trilogy several times, including the audiobooks in anticipation of this film. I purposefully did not read the book for this movie, because I like to read the books after. While the rating seems good, I'm not understanding the large number of negative reviews.The Hunger Games is YA - it seems a lot of people are expecting something different. The school setting of the trainers and Viola Davis's character felt very appropriate for the genre, and so did the immature characters. The melodrama between them, and the general focus was exactly as expected. The movie has a PG-13 rating, so while it is a dark story, the violence is toned down. This is not Game of Thrones, despite Peter Dinklage being there. I suspect the lack of intensity might have been an issue in expectations for some. In addition, the games themselves are only one part, rather than the main focus of the film. This is not a sequel meant to relive the original trilogy. Those books and movies stand alone. That saga is complete.However, if you focus on the message and themes, much of the story is actually very striking. Snow is a realistic villain, which is exactly the point. It also occurs in the time of his life when these character developments really occur. He is never a completely sympathetic character because that would not be believable. From the beginning, we can see that he is strategizing more than caring, in contrast to many of his classmates, especially his friend, Plinth. In fact, he is a star mentor right away, attracting the attention of the head game maker, played by Viola Davis. The story is well crafted, and I'm so excited to now fill in the blanks by reading the book. There are indeed hints at unanswered questions.",
    "140": "There's a lot to like about this movie, but it just doesn't hit the same way the original Hunger Games did. At many points in the movie there seems to be an opportunity to look deeper into the psyche that drives Snow, but instead they only explore it at the surface level. Not sure yet if it's the script or the actor just didn't have the ability to deliver it.Viola Davis for me had the standout performance. She owned her character and was able to create the evil eery feeling of the Panem totalitarian state that the other characters weren't as successful in portraying as the original films. On the other side of things, Peter Dinklage seemed disinterested and didn't really offer much in his role.The overall filming quality and shots are quite good but of course a huge appeal to the Hunger games is seeing the stadium and for obvious reasons this one is a lot more basic than in previous movies.Hunger Games had a good run but I'm afraid the appeal/ interest of it has worn off a little bit over the years .",
    "141": "The actors are so cold and lifeless. District 12 is way more lively than it should be, and they are dressed way too well after the games.Lucie Gray actress is acting like a cold robot. On paper she's doing really well, but she's missing emotion and soul when acting. Also, what's going on with her jaw, is she on cocaine?The pacing is too fast and the game was unrealistic, nobody could have survived that. They barely show District 12 and we're supposed to care for them?Recent american cinema is missing the mark on so many movies big time. It's time they stop recycling actors in all their movies.Not a movie I would recomment, 4/10, below average.The only good thing about this movie is the set design.",
    "142": "\"The Mockingjay\" book has been adapted into 2 movies for no good reason and it went terrible. The producers learned a hard lesson, but now it seems like it was even too hard for them, cause \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes\" feels like it has adapted two books into one movie, even thought it didn't.This movie has some serious timing problems. It's definitely too long, but at the same time manages to make you feel like the second part of it is too short and should be extended. I feel like it should be separated into two movies. One about the 10th Hunger Games and the rise of Snow (this doesn't really need much more, that the first hour and a half of this movie) and another one about how he turned from an ambitious boy in love to a overambitious manipulator and tyrant (this one definitely needs more time and depth).The most frustrating thing about the new Hunger Games movie is that literally every element of it is interesting, but still none of them is really well done and fulfills its potential. The main character is interesting, writers try to make him deep, they almost succed, but then they don't have enough time to finish the job, cause the movie cannot be even longer than it actually is.In the end, I feel so much wasted potential that it makes me angry, even thought I'm not really emotionally invested in the franchise.",

    "144": "The Hunger Games movies, for the most part, have been well made and faithful adaptations of the books. So when I turned the final page of Hunger Games: The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes, I was looking forward to the movie much more than I expected to before I started reading the book.Thankfully The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes is another strong and faithful adaptation. We return to the capital 65 years before the events of original Hunger Games films and a few years after the Panem Civil War. We meet a young Cornelius Snow shortly before he and his Capitol class mates mentor tributes in the 10th Annual Hunger Games. We then embark on a three part character study.Firstly, the Capitol looked great. It's not the over the top, bright, excessive and indulgent Capitol we are used to. It's dark and gritty but also a futuristic city seeking to make technological advances. There are times when the CGI is shaky for example when we see cockroaches, rats or explosions but otherwise the film looks great. I especially enjoyed some of the camera work and the interesting use of angles that brought us closer to the action.Viola Davis and Pinter Dinklage were excellent in their roles as Dr Gaul and Dean Highbottom whilst Jason Schwartzman was fantastic as Lucky Flickerman, the movie's only comic relief as weatherman and host of the Hunger Games. The two leads will likely draw several different opinions. They weren't perfect but still had aspects that worked. Tom Blyth played a good Cornelius Snow although it is hard not to think about how majestic Donald Sutherlund is as a older more Powerful Snow. Rachel Zeglar has a great voice which is fully on display as Songbird Lucy Grey Baird, the female tribute from District 12. I wasn't fully sold on other aspects of her performance. That being said, If I had to recast one character in the Hunger Games franchise it would still be Peeta. The chemistry between the leads was questionable at times but perhaps that is to be expected when a boy from the Capitol meets a girl from District 12?I enjoyed the story when I read the book and it was represented well on screen. The movie builds on the lore of The Hunger Games and especially the background of Cornelius Snow in a way that helps us to interpret the originally trilogy in a much more profound way. Director Francis Lawrence originally wanted to split the movie in two but I'm glad it ended up being one movie. However, this resulted in a runtime of 2 hours 37 minutes. The movie squeezed a lot into this time which mostly worked well although there were a couple of instances where I questioned things which happened on screen which I didn't question when reading the book because I had more information available to me at the time. So those who haven't read the book may find it stuffed and the weight of certain scenes may not have the intended impact.The action is fun and brutal at times. At no point did I feel as if they we were catering to a younger audience. This Hunger Games was set in standard oval stadium in the times before the elaborate settings of the future games. This resulted in a larger focus on close combat and hiding which I enjoyed.Overall, The Ballard of Songbirds and Snakes is another well adapted Hunger Games movie. Its dark, gritty and more importantly it tells a standalone story but also a story that enhances our understanding of Cornelius Snow and allows us to view the original trilogy in a way that adds additional layers to the viewing experience. It's a long film and has a lot going on which may not cater to everybody. Highly recommended to fans of the Hunger Games.",
    "145": "I didn't give myself over to Songbirds & Snakes immediately. The movie certainly had my attention and I think the opening was very strong in establishing Coriolanus as a complicated protagonist and setting him down his path to both his triumph and later his destruction. It took me a while to warm up to Lucy Gray, she was too feisty and too finely geared to make her likeable. But her willingness to trust Snow instead of just being whiny and mistrustful and her not too squeaky clean sense of morality wore me down. Her character picks up steam after the games are done and by the end, I was rooting for her. My biggest problem with the original series was how selfish and petulant Katniss could be and Songbirds & Snakes flips the formula by asking us to root for the villain. One of my friends suggested a House of Cards style show just showing Snow's rise to power and S&S showed the potential and promise that kind of project.I hadn't seen either Tom Blyth previously but to follow Donald Sutherland in this role couldn't have been easy. I was quite impressed with his commanding presence and how well he captured Snow's charm and conversely his ruthlessness. He definitely brought some humanity to the character and he conveys slow descent well. Rachel has a ton of energy as Lucy Gray and she's good at being vulnerable in the beginning and being coy & mysterious near the end. Viola Davis, Peter Dinklage and Jason Schwartzman are the heavy hitters in the supporting cast and I enjoyed them all. Viola comes on strong at the start (could the obviously evil character turn out to be evil?) but her performance fits and Dr. Gaul transforms into a formidable enemy by the end.I also want to congratulate this movie for putting more of a focus on the animosity between the Capitol and the Districts. There's a lot more anger and venom between the two sides and the bitterness adds to the stakes. They also do a good job of showing how disorganized the games could be in their beginning cycles. This version of the Hunger Games is much less glamorous, the tributes are barely suitable, the mentors are only in it for themselves and the citizens of the Capitol barely care. It adds to the bleakness of the festivities and how they would eventual fuel another rebellion which is important in where the story will eventually finish with the Katniss saga.I did have some problems with this movie, but they were mostly minor. Songbirds & Snakes relies on some plot contrivances and the film can't help but being a little precious when it's winking at elements from the original trilogy. This is something that isn't unique to Songbirds & Snakes but wouldn't it be nice if it could have been avoided? But the easiest and most obvious problem is that S&S feels a little overproduced. It's been pruned and tweaked for maximum power several times over and it robs it of some of it's spontaneity. I still really enjoyed it but I couldn't help but feel like I was being manipulated a little bit.I really didn't expect much going into this movie. I saw the original trilogy and read the books but I considered The Hunger Games finished and I moved on. I was blown away by how intricately packed and well made this prequel was. Judging by the other user reviews, I might in the minority but Songbirds & Snakes builds on the mythology while staying true to the spirit, the film shapes Coriolanus Snow into a layered and engaging character/villain and reignites the fire for this universe. I'm somewhere between an 8.5-9/10 but I'd wholly recommend this and unless you're extremely attached to the original trilogy, I'd be surprised if you walk away from the theatre without something to discuss or a new appreciation for this franchise. To Suzanne Collins, Francis Lawrence and the creative team, Bravo!",
    "146": "It's a savage, 1984 dystopian satire, on class inequality. Much of this comes from the unfamiliar and grand 1984 urban-scapes filmed in Poland and Germany.From another angle, it plays more like like a horror film; you wait for each young kid to be killed to find out how. It's dark, not a young adult action flick like the original Hunger Games trilogy or the first Mazerunner movie. Would have done better at box-office released in October for Halloween?Best acting is by an unrecognizable Viola Davis (The Woman King). She's a mad scientist supper-villain--yet, not over-done. If Donald Sutherland was 10/10 crazy, she takes \"unhinged\" to 11. Impressive. She commits to showing the ugliest and unpleasant aspect of dissociated economic elites.Using title cards, the movie is divided into three acts. The end of the second act is the highpoint of the film. DON'T MISS IT! Brilliant and amazing filmmaking! Afterwards, I was half ready for the credits to roll. Yet it goes on for another 45 minutes to show us how young Snow became old Snow in the trilogy.The King's Man (2021) had a similar problem. The film peaked at the end of the first act. For Hollywood blockbusters, both The King's Man and this film are original and narratively unorthodox. I believe the average male movie ticket buyer often perceives \"original\" movies as \"problematic.\" The Creator (2023) also had originality audiences did not appreciate.Joss Whedon's scripting maxim still applies, to be big hits, a movie has to announce its genre to audiences; and then, \"stay within its lane,\" be creative with the tropes available to work with. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023) took Joss's advice to good effect.",

    "148": "Unlike so many movies of late, I found this Hunger Games prequel to be engaging, immersive, yet quite disturbing. I had not read the book deliberately, because I wanted to experience the film in its own right, rather than how faithfully it reproduced a written work. Regardless, it effectively chronicles the pivotal events in the nascent corruption of Coriolanus Snow.The horror of the actual Games is far more primitive, gritty and raw than before... much more like Thunderdome from the Mad Max franchise: \"Get to the weapons. Use them any way you can. I know you won't break the rules. There aren't any.\" The sickness of this society is encapsulated by the fact that one of the Tributes is a young girl who appears to have Down's Syndrome. Try to wrap your head around that idea...I found the characters to be sufficiently developed for the purposes of the film's narrative. Folk music is interwoven into the movie, perfectly to effect: one of the main protagonists is a folk singer who expresses her emotions and defiance through song.The \"look and feel\" of this era of Panem is brilliant: a bizarrely familiar reimagining of mid-century modern motifs grotesquely blended with elements of the totalitarian architecture of the Third Reich. For those who know the actual photographic record of the latter, you will see numerous things in this film which echo that visual vocabulary, and not simply the sets.I'd recommend seeing this film: given the times we live in, it certainly is a thought-provoking journey.",
    "149": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is by far one of the best entries in The Hunger Games franchise! A perfect adaptation of the novel, it expands on its dark dystopian world with rich costumes, stunning art direction, an epic score, and a sense of scale and scope that's fitting for this prequel about the rise of President Snow. And it's so much richer than dystopian young adult adaptations are usually ever allowed to be! I'm struggling to remember the last time a prequel was this much better and more interesting than the rest of its franchise. I love the nuanced, darker story that is more of a character study than anything which was so well executed by returning director Francis Lawrence in this colder prequel. He brought new life to the franchise with his masterful take on Catching Fire, and did it once again with The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, delivering a darker, more sinister version of the Games through Snow's perspective that is ten times better than it has any right to be.Significantly more intimate and grounded than the previous Hunger Games movies (despite being longer than any of them and responsible for seeding all of their lore), The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is the rare prequel that manages to stand on its own two feet and still feel taller than the other stories it's ultimately meant to support.But the real star is the cast. They crush it. Rachel Zegler truly shines and is super captivating in this. If you thought she was good in West Side Story, just wait until you see her here! Plus she gets to show off her incredible singing skills multiple times! I really loved her here, she truly is a star on the rise. Her character Lucy Gray is very different from Katniss, (Katniss was a fighter forced to perform, Lucy Gray is a performer forced to fight) and the tense, twisty dynamics between Lucy and Tom Blyth's Coriolanus are a treat to watch. Tom Blyth is a standout, selling Snow's moral ambiguity/decay with such a subtle, nuanced, and gifted performance. Viola Davis and Peter Dinklage are powerhouses and wildly compelling, as they usually are. Davis' character in particular is so devious, and it's so marvelous to watch. Plus this film has one of the 3 best Jason Schwartzman performances of the year - he's hilarious in this!With high stakes, solid action, and killer performances, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a thrilling return to Panem, assisted by some excellent production design and the return of memorable motifs/themes in the musical score. I love that so many people who worked on the original films came back for this one, really helping to make it all feel cohesive with the other films (especially thanks to James Newton Howard's excellent score)! This is purely grand, epic storytelling. It's long for sure, but doesn't drag. It works well by doing something fairly different from the first series, taking on a unique story structure that most studios would try to separate into a two-part movie. But I'm so glad they didn't split this up, and it still came out as such a faithful adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel. I loved this film! My sister, who doesn't love movies, loved this film (said it's the longest she's ever been compelled by a movie)! It's genuinely a very fair candidate for the best film in The Hunger Games franchise, either as good as or better than Catching Fire! The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a magnificent film that not only excels in its own right, but also enriches the original franchise that is it now a part of. If you loved The Hunger Games, you can't miss this!It's the things we love most that destroy us."
