    "0": "Clearly this gal can do anything, and seeing her in a full-on comedy film enabled her to show her true comedic chops, and she certainly has those. I always found her hilarious in real life - in interviews, segments, etc, and found her to have a down to earth comedic personality, so it's about time she was her true self in a film. The story itself is nothing we haven't seen before, but all casting and performances were spot on, as was the directing, cinematography and score. The pacing was perfect in that the 103 min runtime flew by. There were many laugh out loud moments, especially from Lawrence's antics, and that's what made this film that much more enjoyable. In addition to the comedy, there are some heart warming moments that added that extra touch to this film. I'd have no problem watching this again, especially with some friends, weekend beverages and our brains turned off.",
    "1": "It's definitely not the raunchy comedy promised by its trailers and initial premise, although those moments are there but No Hard Feelings is a surprisingly sweet comedy that has enough laughs and predictably satisfying arcs throughout the course of it's run time to remain a really entertaining watch.Jennifer Lawrence is great, more than capable of covering all the grounds the role requires and even makes the more emotional moments that could feel out of place actually work. Andrew Barth Feldman is also great, his awkwardness never becomes annoying, instead its always endearing and funny.Gene Stupnitsky's direction is really good, making sure the central premise never gets uncomfortable in undesired ways, adding some clever inversions for a few memorable jokes and keeping the film light on its feet thanks to a couple of montages as well.",
    "2": "This film reminds me of the 2000s. This kind of genre which they hardly release in cinemas anymore.Apparently its based on a craiglist ad which means that the story is not outlandish, the ad actually happened in real life ! Nevertheless I enjoyed this movie.very funny and its nice to see Jennifer Lawrence show off her comedic chops.I think the age gap is not a big deal at all. They have been making films with way older men and way younger women since Hollywood existed so why is it a problem that the women is older? They both have great chemistry ! Highly recommend this film if you want some laughs with a bit of a heartfelt story!",
    "3": "Maddie Barker (Jennifer Lawrence) is struggling to save her home in Montauk, New York. The working class people are being driven out by the rich summer people. Maddie is way behind in taxes and loses her car which she needs for Uber. She answers a Craigslist post from the Beckers (Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick). Their son Percy Becker (Andrew Barth Feldman) is a reclusive virgin set to start Princeton. They want him laid and gain life confidence. They hire Maddie to have sex with him in exchange for an used car.JLaw has some comedic skills. She's better than most actresses in doing broad comedy although she is not strictly a comedian. There is a difference in what she can do. During the naked fight, I am reminded of Jason Segel in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I laughed at Jason's doughy pathetic nakedness. JLaw is neither doughy nor pathetic. That scene is not sexy and it's not comedic either. It exists in a middle ground of awkwardness. The sex part of the story is awkward. They need to pick a lane. She is either a romantic partner or platonic friend. JLaw can do funny slapstick and that's one of her bigger strengths. The characters do have great heart and at its best, this movie has some of the Harold and Maude magic. All in all, it's an enjoyable comedy.",
    "4": "However, the film loses steam in the last 30-40 minutes because it becomes a lot more serious. There are still some jokes and many are funny at that part of the film. But the tonal shift of the movie felt a little jarring.It also is incredibly sweet and not really cheesy. Only a repeat of a gag earlier in the last 10 minutes of the movie seemed a bit cheesy.Jennifer Lawrence needs to do more comedies though. She has a ton of charisma for romcoms.As a guy, I haven't liked many romcoms, but this one was far more modern compared to those 90's and 2000's ones. Trainwreck was another pretty funny movie to me as well.",
    "5": "No Hard Feelings is a feel good film, the character's relationship akin to the recent 2017 \"The Babysitter\" film. Where the bond remains even though the initial intentions aren't on the up and up. Despite Jennifer Lawrence making the film what it is, the highlight's Percy playing and singing \"Maneater\" to Maddie, as well the other occupants of the restaurant. It really encapsulates the entirety of the film and the wall he broke through, a teary eye moment for sure. It was nicely setup, which is good writing. I suspect this is why and only why Lawrence would take such a role, I find most of the responses to the film here pretty juvenile. The comedy's somewhat hit and miss though.",
    "6": "This movie instantly sold me on \"From the director of Good Boys.\" I adore that movie. It's hysterical. No Hard Feelings has a similar tone and type of comedy. It's the kind that never feels like it's holding back. And the R-rating means it doesn't have to play it safe, which is awesome.For most of the movie, I was enjoying it. The premise is amusing and it's entertaining overall. But I didn't find it nearly as funny as Good Boys. And it leans much more heavily on the drama side, especially late in the movie when the comedic attempts are scarce.But the biggest downside is a few jaw-droppingly dumb moments during the last act. It swung my score from a mildly positive 6 to a mediocre 5. I didn't mind watching it, but I've seen much better. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 6/22/2023)",
    "7": "This movie definitely met me and my friend group's expectations for comedy, our whole theater practically laughed out loud every few minutes. Jennifer's comedic timing is something I hope we get to see more of on the big screen. An amazing actor as always. The tonal shift to a more serious story in the last half might catch some off guard, but I think it added some realism and depth to the plot. More than that though, the best comedies still have a message and core of serious as light it may be with that shiny happy ending. I really enjoyed this movie and had fun in a theater for the first time in a while.",
    "8": "I'm not exactly a fan of Jennifer Lawrence. And really can't stand her fan base. The story line seemed cheap and ugly and most sex comedies are awful. But I saw the trailer and laughed and thought it might not be too bad.It was really great. Funny, endearing, character growth, with a great message. Maybe get to know a person instead of having sex with random strangers. I can see why a lot of moral less would hate that.The young man was a little annoying at first but he grows on you really fast and he does a solid job.Jennifer Lawrence's character grows and becomes a better person during the film. Your association really does matter. Choose wisely.",
    "9": "\"No Hard Feelings\" is a surprising old school romantic comedy, totally politically incorrect. We have a script with quite comical and romantic moments, from the middle of its duration the coming of age drama abounds more and it achieves it perfectly. It's a throwback to early 2000's rom-coms. The performances are very good, highlighting the two leads: Jennifer Lawrence and Andrew Barth Feldman. The cinematography and music are simple but effective. The editing does a good job of highlighting the comedy and drama. It should be noted that the film has a wonderful soundtrack. \"No Hard Feelings\" is a current classic!",
    "10": "On the brink of losing her childhood home, Maddie discovers an intriguing job listing: wealthy helicopter parents looking for someone to \"date\" their introverted 19-year-old son, Percy, before he leaves for college.To her surprise, Maddie soon discovers the awkward Percy is no sure thing......This film is really proving to be decisive for lots of people. Some say it's a laugh out loud comedy full of charm, and some say it's a puerile bore fest that's disguising itself as a raunchy callbacks to those 'we need to lose out virginity before prom' comedies that were rife in the eighties, and then made a little popular again with American Pie.This definitely falls into the latter for me.I didn't laugh once during this bore fest, but other people in my screening were having a whale of a time, and I'm glad that some people are really liking this. But it just wasn't for me.Apart from one eye popping scene on the beach at night, it doesn't really offer anything new. And that scene on the beach only really stands out because you just wouldn't expect it from the lead.It feels so much like There's Something About Mary at times. We get introduced to random characters throughout the film who have little quirks that are supposed to be funny, but are just annoying, and of course, we have the married couple who are Maddies best friends, who have their. Little tropes too. And to be honest, they are the best thing about the film.But, and I say this through gritted teeth, the friendship that Maddie and Percy have is quite touching at times, particularly toward the end, and if this could have been elaborated on, instead of the writers trying to get Maddie to use profanity in every other sentence, then this could have been a standout movie.Instead, we get an unfunny comedy, with abhorrent characters, and another scenario featuring Matthew Broderick and a car.No Hard Feelings left me flaccid.",
    "11": "I saw No Hard Feelings, starring Jennifer Lawrence-the X_Men movies, The Bill Engvall Show_tv; Andrew Barth Feldman-A Tourist's Guide to Love, White Noise; Laura Benanti-The Late Show With Stephen Colbert_tv, Gossip Girl_tv and Matthew Broderick-Love is Blind, Trainwreck.This is a comedy that is based on a real Craigslist ad. Matthew and Laura play helicopter parents to 19 year old Andrew. The parents are rich, so they have no problem keeping tabs on their son-they track his movements using his phone-who is about to go off to college. The problem is that Andrew is introverted and awkward socially so Matthew and Laura place an ad on Craigslist for a girl to bring him out of his shell. It just so happens that Jennifer has financial problems-she just lost her car and she is a part time Uber driver-and the ad states that the parents will give a brand new car to whomever can awaken their son before he goes off to college. Andrew doesn't make it easy for Jennifer and it is predictable in parts-when people discover secrets-but it is still funny and heartwarming.It's rated R for language, drug and alcohol use and sexual content-including graphic nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.I enjoyed it and I would buy it on DVD.",
    "12": "Gene Stupnitsky continues his trend in giving us these funny, raunchy and at times touching movies. No Hard Feelings however seems more Dramedy than straight up Comedy. Now, that doesn't mean it wasn't fun. It had its moments that the theater was just bursting in laughter. Then there were moments where the tone shifts to a more serious one and that allowed Jennifer Lawrence's performance to shine. There was more of that serious tone than I was expecting.I thought I was going to see something to the level of Good Boys but instead it was a bit more drama with various funny moments. Which again was not bad. Some were over the top but that's to be expected with these types of movies. For example there's a beach scene that completely took it to another level. There's a small sample of it in the trailer but the entire scene completely caught me off guard and it's hilarious when you realize that you have an Oscar winning actress doing all of it. Fun flick.",
    "13": "Terrible storyline...... I was expecting a funny movie because Jennifer Lawrence was in it. I couldn't believe she picked this script? I couldn't believe she agreed to be fully nude for this kind of movie? Does the nudity really necessary? The relationship of 32 years old woman with 18 years old boy..... totally unacceptable.The story was low class, the acting was horrible and the directing was bad as well. I was so disappointed. I thought it would be a nice romcom but such low quality & low budget film. The whole I was thinking.... what was I watching here? I hope she picks a better script to really showcase her acting.",
    "14": "I had high hopes for this when I first saw the trailer and I'm very glad I watched it.Jennifer Lawrence was hilarious in this and you can tell she had an absolute blast making this. She stole every scene she was in and some of the delivery of her lines were brilliant. There were many funny moments throughout, some raunchy and some cringy but in a good way.What I wasn't expecting was there to be a few heartfelt moments so much so that it felt rather drama like. It didn't happen all that much so it's still a comedy but when it did happen, it sometimes worked with the story but other times felt like it was dragging abit.Is it as funny as other raunchy comedy's like superbad and the 40 year old virgin? No but it's definitely close to those. A must watch!",
    "15": "This movie is by no means perfect, but it is also smart enough to know what it is and what it isn't. The filmmakers know J Law is a legit comedy star, and they also know that this movie feels like an 80s throwback for a reason. That's how long it has been since Hollywood invested in this kind of simple set-up - awkward teen, protective parents, grizzled older woman, and plenty of awkward secrets and sex jokes. It is not rocket science, but the math still works. While the premise doesn't totally pay off and the third act tries a little too hard, it's still hard not to laugh. Sometimes a little charm and solid execution goes a long way.",
    "16": "4 out of 5 stars.No Hard Feelings is a good comedy film which Jennifer Lawrence delivers the humor along with Andrew Barth Feldman. The plot is funny. The acting is fun. The script and humor is hilarious. Yes the film is raunchy with sex jokes. It does not over do it. It does play it safe. About Jennifer Lawrence trying to hook up with an awkward Andrew Barth Feldman. Which they both did a great job every time they are on the screen. The films ending felt a little weak. Still makes a great fun time with the laughs and humor. Overall, Jennifer Lawrence can handle a comedy film with a raunchy humor that never gets boring.",
    "17": "Others have pointed out the sick wrongness of hiring an old woman to seduce a young man. If it were a middle-aged man being hired to seduce a teen girl the world would go up in flames and come down in ashes. But I think they miss the point: MAYBE it would have been ok, if said middle-aged woman approached her sex mission with kindness and love and respect. But absolutely none of that happens here. Instead the rape is played for laughs. Gross.It's sad that anyone would make this movie. But it's twice as sad that people go to see it! Even though it's toxically disrespectful of men's feelings, people think it's funny. I think it's sick and wrong.",
    "18": "Wow, did this movie ever suck. First of all, congratulations to the maker of the trailer for making a sap out of me. What was presented as a raunchy teen sex comedy of yesteryear, goes from comedy, abruptly to serious, sappy, sad, ugly, obnoxious, and predictable. What you've got is a 30-ish minute raunchy comedy, nestled inside an hour and 45 of SOMETHING I'm not even positive how to qualify. The majority of what's actually funny in this movie can be found in the trailer, which is a far cry from what No Hard Feelings actually offers.Let me clarify that I have no issues with its premise, one that so many reviewers found offensive, simply because it's a throwback to the sex comedies of the 80's and 90's (and 00's), where they'd push the envelope of tastelessness. Is a rich teen introvert's parent's hiring of a 32-year old woman, to break him out of his shell, and take his virginity in exchange for a car an offensive premise? YES, and that's the idea!! And NO, of course, this would not get made if the roles were reversed. Again, that's the idea. It's both PC and un-PC in the year 2023. (I dunno, give Weird Science some thought for a minute). I take far more umbrage with the fact that they were too chicken$#!t to follow through with the retro premise. This gets soft and gooey by the end of the first act. No Hard Feelings' greatest sin: It's ultimately a bore.I found Jennifer Lawrence to be funny, sporadically, through the first 30 minutes, but when you get down to it, pretty much every character appearing is unlikeable and reprehensible. Modern movie trope. I particularly hated the kid, who went from mousy introverted agoraphobic geek, to a rather easily outward personality and suave musician, to the completely obnoxious, spoiled, entitled, selfish rich kid he actually is. Generated zero sympathy from me, and I'd advise the writers of this tripe to go back and look at some John Hughes movies. (Coincidently, a scraggly Matthew Broderick appears as one of the kid's wayward parents, who essentially hires him a hooker).I also found the portrayal of the Jennifer Lawrence character kind of insulting. In many instances, much is made of her age, like she's some sort of freak (see: the Princeton party scene, where she is gawked at by everyone like her hair is on fire). 32 is also not \"middle-aged\"! Not saying this premise is \"acceptable,\" or that she herself isn't totally misguided, but she is still very much a youthful-looking and beautiful young woman. Not the old hag she is portrayed as. Also, she is considered by numerous characters as a \"loser\" for living in her home town for the duration of her life. I couldn't make sense of this, especially the way this flick pans out.For what is billed as a raunchy sex comedy, and devolves into a completely uninteresting goop-fest, I could find no discernible message in the end. Like, I wasn't given what was represented in the preview, and I'm assuming the makers of this film wanted to convey these characters \"grew\" as people... which is super dubious.SPOILER: Kid gets wind of his parent's plot to get him laid, has a meltdown, forces his parents to sit down and be yelled at and talked down to. JLaw gets her life together... somehow... wants to reconcile with the brat, he wants none of it. How else can this end? They make up, are all buddy-buddy, and JLaw adopts the cocaine dog (ooh, hilarious!). They eventually go their separate ways (er, somber road trip sequel/sidebar?), spoiled obnoxious rich kid to Princeton, and JLaw to... California! To... bartend and drive an drive an Uber?So, the kid stood up to his parents, JLaw moved somewhere... happier? Is that what I'm supposed to get out of this? It was a pretty pointless exercise in futility, if you ask me. One extra star for Jennifer Lawrence's brief comedic performance.",
    "19": "I'm appalled at this movie, so unnecessarily trashy. Not tastefully done at all. I've never been a fan of Jennifer Lawrence but I've heard this movie was good and I was hoping it would change my mind about her. But she is just AWFUL, for someone who's won Academy Awards, how would she agree to do this movie? So trashy and in bad taste, just yuck. I mean running completely nude to beat up some teens? What did I watch? I stopped watching half-way through, didn't care enough to finish the movie.This child they put in the movie is apparently going to Princeton? I'm sure he will regret this movie one day.Do better Hollywood. 0/10, save your brain cells.",
    "20": "I just don't even know what to say about this film. I kind of expected it to be mildly amusing, I was hoping for some effective comedy, maybe some tender moments, maybe some poignancy, or some redeeming qualities. This film turned out to be a real mess. I don't think that the writer or director had any idea where they wanted to go with this, and I think they just threw a bunch of ideas against the wall and hope that they would stick.I normally consider Jennifer Lawrence to be a good actress and she absolutely stank up this film, she wasn't funny, she wasn't sexy, she wasn't interesting, she wasn't seductive, she was just kind of repulsive. The kid was slightly interesting but they never really did anything with this character. This movie failed on virtually every level, please save yourself 90 minutes of your life and watch something else.",
    "21": "When I saw the trailer for this 2023 comedy earlier this year, I was thinking what a letdown for Jennifer Lawrence to go from the subtle heartbreak of \"Causeway\" to what looked like a raunchy, flat-out fratboy-humor farce. However, I watched it and actually liked the raunchy, flat-out fratboy-humor because director and co-writer Greg Stupnitsky showcases Lawrence's considerable comedy chops with dexterity. She's hilariously inappropriate as Maddie, a down-on-her-luck woman who answers a Craigslist ad to increase the sexual confidence of Percy, the socially awkward 19-year-old son of wealthy helicopter parents. Lawrence throws herself into the role with pure abandon, and her no-holds-barred talk-show persona comes to the fore. The beach scene where she takes back her clothes was a genuine riot. Surprisingly where the film fell short was the third act when the story softens and loses some of its edge. Andrew Barth Feldman is quite good as Percy who reacts appropriately to Maddie's shenanigans. Better than I expected.",
    "22": "Jennifer Lawrence is my absolute favorite but this movie was such a let down. My daughter and I went to this movie. She just graduated from high school last month. At one point she looked at me and ask, \"Mom, if I was really shy, would you ever pay a 32 year old man to have s3x with me to prepare me for college????\" I looked at her like she was nuts and told her that's disgusting. She agreed. And her point was very clear.From that moment on, all I could think about was how creepy and gross the message of this movie is. It's toxic and desperately tried normalize a situation that is anything but normal.",
    "23": "You people are playing a horrible trick on the viewing public. Jennifer Lawrence is a fair actress but this movie and her role in it was just horrible. I am shocked that she watched this film and allowed it to be released and might want to consider a brassiere in future movies. The kid that played the boy man was boring and lacked any amount of acting. The movie itself was forced and just standard fair by some mediocre writers. And that is mediocre at best. Even they must have watched that film and thought - \"omg\" what the holy heck did we just put on film. It would have been so much better if they had used a better male actor and a female actress who didn't have to over act to try to prove that they being in Hollywood and based on her performance I would say - jennifer does not belong there any longer and is just coasting on past roles. I say it is time for Hollywood to reinvent itself. Movie stank badly.",
    "24": "I did NOT expect to like this! I thought it'd be those usual corny and cringeworthy ones from this genre, I haven't seen a good one in AGES. But this was perfect! Jennifer Lawrence was a vision and hysterical and the rest of the cast was fantastic as well.What a wonderful surprise.It was the perfect lazy afternoon viewing while packing my bags to meet my hubby and daughter at our summer place tomorrow-(this mama needed 10 days of solo bliss).Huge thumbs up.Okay, filling up now for the word count, this is so silly, I don't really have much more to elaborate, okay, nearly there getting there, done.",
    "25": "You could watch the trailer and get all the funny scenes and then predict what would happen. It's pretty predictable. I wanted to like this movie because the trailer was funny but I feel the trailer gave away too much. It gave away also all the funny scenes. Watching the movie, I saw the only funny parts were the ones in the trailer. There were about 5 others in the theater and I didn't hear any laughter during the funny scenes. A smirk here and there but no laughter. Like I said, predictable.This movie also came out as....\"rapey\". A women who's soul purpose is to hook up with this barely legal kid and pressed onto him that they should sleep together even though he's not comfortable at all with it due to not knowing her and her talking ill\nof the kid because he actually wants to get to know her before getting in the sack. Calling him a baby everywhere from the habits he was grown up with and presenting onto her which.....isn't even baby habits. Having protective parents isn't evil. Tracking your kid isn't babying. It's parenting, wanting to know your kid is safe. Now contacting a women 2x his age to sleep with him...now that's just weird! She doesn't assert herself as being a woman she portrays herself to be infront of the parents. She allows the kid to drink alcohol, kidnaps him basically, pressures him to do it! Runs away from the law. This is a confusing image the creators have given to the audience.She comes off as way too strong, on a kid. I kept thinking \"what if this was reversed\"?! A guy who pressures a barely legal woman to do it. It's hypocritical of the main character to talk about treating the kid with respect yet goes full on blast to get his pants off. It sends of a bad message to the viewers. All for her to save her house at the end, but doesn't do so.",
    "26": "In the past 10 years, I've probably seen more than 200 movies at theaters. This is the first movie that I've ever walked out on. 45 minutes in, I couldn't handle the torture anymore. This is the most unfunny piece of garbage I've ever seen. Although, I did get a good chuckle when about 50% of the audience had left before the halfway mark.It's hard to meet the minimum post-length requirement for this movie, because there isn't much to say about it.I didn't find any of the gags clever. Nor did I find them funny. I did think some of the set designs looked okay.Just avoid this. It's not even worth a rental.",
    "27": "Just imagine if the gender roles were reversed, a 32 year old trying to force a 19 year only into acts like that.Disgusting. The young boy said no, was clearly nervous, upset, didn't want to and she pressured him. After all that still took his virginity in the end too. Embarrassed him at a party infront of his friends and stopping him being with someone his own age.It's messed up really, not sure how this has been allowed, if it was an older man doing this to a younger girl then everyone would be appalled.Also, not even really fun or great acting at all. Below average film.Wouldn't recommend.",
    "28": "This movie is so bizarre, I don't even really know what to think of it. It's an absurd sex comedy that turns into a rom-com and ends as a Hallmark movie about friendship. It's super-uncomfortable to watch, but entertaining in trashy, 80's kind of way. You know, back when a 32-year-old being sexually inappropriate with a naive high school student could be considered hilarious. Think Porky's or Fast Times at Ridgemont High.I have no idea why someone as talented and famous as Jennifer Lawrence would want to appear in this movie, let alone star in it and romp around naked for several minutes, but she does a good job and seems to be having fun. More power to her, I guess?",
    "29": "The screenplay for \"No Hard Feelings\" was successful in balancing the serious and the comic in this endearing coming-of-age story.Young Percy Becker learns some life lessons and comes out of his shell in his relationship with the dynamic Maddie Barker. Despite the preposterous premise of Percy's parents \"hiring\" Maddie to groom their son, a credible relationship unfolded between the two leads.The dialogue was snappy, and there was a fine set of secondary characters, including Maddie's best friends, the ex-boyfriend driving the tow truck, and Percy's male \"nanny.\" The \"cocaine\" dog was hilarious!The comic bits were great, and there was an engaging set of locations. The various film genres were held together nicely by Jennifer Lawrence, who created a multi-dimensional character in Maddie, who was the heart and soul of Montauk.",

Andrew Barth Feldman is also good here, thinking he is just a typical nerd, but turns into something more has the movie goes on, and He and Lawrence have great chemistry. The movie has a lot of laughs and a lot heart to it, I believe it's worth checking out.",

    "32": "This movie is actually something exceptional masquerading as something typical. It's not a raunchy comedy. It's an open-ended romance. The exceptional part is the subtlety with which the characters grow and change, how well-suited they are to lift each other, and how, even as the film beats us over the head with blatant hint after blatant hint, most people will never see a future between the two characters.This movie takes the ephemeral nature of love and gives it form, real form... but it's hidden by all the other pieces of the characters lives, as happens in reality. It's like the film is this incredibly sophisticated art film hidden in a raunchy comedy... and if you think I'm reading into it too far, listen to the Bob Seger song at the end:\n\"I've made my mind up girl\nIt's meant to be\nSomeday lady you'll accomp'ny me\nSomeday lady you'll accomp'ny me\nIt's written down somewhere\nIt's got to be\nYou're high above me\nFlying wild and free\nOh but someday lady you'll accomp'ny me\"",
    "33": "I just love it when I find a comedy that I know will probably become one of those that I watch six times over a period of a few years! This is one such movie! The writing is superb with many of the quick comebacks, and both main characters really rock their roles.This movie does a divine job of mixing absurd comedy with heartfelt moments and absolute melancholy. I even voiced my query early in the movie when I said to my SO, \"Wow, I wonder how they are going to wrap this one up...?\"I do not want to have to label this review as containing spoiler alerts so I will just say I highly recommend this very R-rated movie for every adult audience that needs a laugh! (In fact, one of my favorite things about it was the entire audience guffawed aloud several times.)",
    "34": "Jennifer Lawerence attempts to be funny exceeded my expectations. I never thought of her as a meryl streep. Type until now.It felt like she was truly giving an A plus performance here as she plays a uber driver attempting to keep her house by agreeing to have sex with a 19-year-old wallflower.It was the type of role you would expect from a man, and I love seeing women do it on screen and J Law did it well.A little contempt at what this movie says about the new gens out there, but it was a funny window into their world.I can't say it enough. This was one of the best comedies I have seen in a long time.",
    "35": "I particularly enjoyed the initial dialogues, although as the minutes passed, the plot gradually took on a tone similar to typical afternoon session productions. However, it wouldn't be suitable for airing in the afternoon or even at 9 PM, due to an unnecessary sequence in which Jennifer Lawrence appears in a nudity scene on the beach. It's regrettable that Jennifer chose to participate in a film with a simplistic plot and a gratuitous nudity scene. The character Maddie could have been portrayed by any less talented actress, but never by Jennifer, who continues to showcase her talent. The soundtrack, on the other hand, falls short, aimed primarily at a teenage audience. Since I watched the movie on my computer, I chose to mute the audio when there were no dialogues, only music. One of the most intriguing aspects, especially for cinephiles over 50 years old, was the opportunity to see, after so many years, actor Matthew Broderick; he appears with long hair, a bit chubby, and naturally displaying signs of aging. I felt like I wasted my time.",
    "36": "Pretty funny, very raunchy, goofy fun, and unique for Jennifer Lawrence! I enjoyed this more than I thought I would although some of it is a little ridiculous even outrageous at times but it's charming romantic/comedy. Some of it is fairly sad yet stays enjoyable throughout. I loved a lot of it and Jennifer's performance is wild entertaining I've barely seen her like this before that's the most satisfying aspect of all she's wonderful in drama and action I'm surprised she hasn't done more comedy! I think the main guy is kinda like Beavis and Butt-Head he barely gets to score lol. Nice to see Matthew Broderick still doing well after so many years since Ferris Beuller's Day Off. Overall pretty good movie.",
    "37": "This feels like a comedy from 15 years ago that you would say \"it would never get made today\" except is from 2023. It's not on the comedic level of Wedding Crashers or Tropic Thunder, but it was still great. I laughed out loud at a movie theater for the first time in about five years. This little Long Island comedy could potentially save Hollywood. Screw all this woke nonsense and keep cranking out comedies like this without worrying about getting cancelled.Jennifer Lawrence is amazing. The entire cast is great and there's a bunch of classic moments. The finger trap scene at the end was priceless.",
    "38": "Jennifer Lawrence definitely shines in this. She gets to do a lot of great physical comedy but she can reel it in for the more quieter moments too. If you're going to see the movie for one reason, it should be her. There is a lot of good jokes in there, again elevated by Jennifer's performance, and also surprisingly heartfelt too. Sometimes, it did cross over and become a little too over the top and would pull me out of the film. Like, I get Percy is supposed to be awkward (and I'm not sure whether intentional- maybe on the autism spectrum) but their first interaction for example he just straight up doesn't seemed interested in her at all, it just feels a little weird that he like suddenly switches and is like \"Date tomorrow?\". I also just didn't think Laura Benanti or Matthew Broderick were funny. They were the weak links.Overall though I thought it was pretty good. I didn't have the biggest expectations going in and I had a pretty good time watching it.",
    "39": "Jennifer's acting is next level in this fun love story. She's the real girl next door, anti-Kardashian keeper. I'm usually not a fan of sappy love stories but whoever wrote, directed and cast Jennifer Lawrence, Thank you. The nude scene was a definite bonus. I'd recommend this movie to anyone! I hope Jennifer keeps acting and making great movies! The role of Percy reminds me of the typical Gen-Z boy who's had his balls removed by our feminist culture. The kinda boy who if his parents weren't wealthy might be a shooter. Lol Great storyline overall. The cinemaphotography and location reminded me of the nice beach towns along the CA coast.",
    "40": "I really liked this! I wasn't expecting much going in as I'd never really heard of it but it sounded like an easy watch. I enjoyed all the performances and JLs character was fun. I think the young man stole the show though. He was hilarious. I'm going to watch it again. It's very charming and a little old fashioned in a good way.I am not sure why there's a character limit on these reviews so I'll carry on by saying that it's funny, I did laugh out loud in some bits and it has dogs. Who doesn't like dogs? Erm 85 characters left. How about install about food instead. It has food in it but I can't remember what items. I've reached the limit! Bye.",
    "41": "Jennifer Lawrence is a goddess sometimes we just need a little push from our comfort zone it doesn't matter if that help comes within or outside like the case here, it was moving at first but the fact that we already knew it was going to blow up at some point it was satisfying, the trick was about him picking him self up conquering that dormant side that is flame to who he is, this could really relate to someone outside in the real world, they both needed closure guess it was a win win to the final she was than a girlfriend in the moments she spent with Percy I hate spoiler but this was actually good work the construct and plot is in sync with the story that the reason why I feel one with the movie.",
    "42": "I lasted 30 minutes. Tacky American humour, lacks even the basic level of intelligence and sophistication. Jennifer Lawrence's character was plain annoying and unlikeable, the premise boring and unimaginative, the jokes not even humorous. Though I didnt get into it far, the only redeaming and likeable character was the shelter former drug dog addicted to cocaine....and even thats not original.Why Lawrence and the calibre of what she is capable of took this role is beyond me. Annoying to have started watching this expecting a reasonably decent standard of acting and story, only to be met with a mediocre excuse for comedy.Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time. Go watch something thats not an insult to your intelligence.",
    "43": "No Hard Feelings is a pretty decent comedy about a woman down on her luck who answers a Craigslist ad from a young man's parents who want her to help bring their son out of his shell in exchange for a car.Jennifer Lawrence and Andrew Barth Feldman work really well together, and their chemistry really shows through their characters keeping the story fresh and interesting. It's full of good laughs and awkward moments that keep the entertainment flowing and leaves you still chuckling by the end.I thought it was a pretty good comedy, and if you haven't seen it before, I'd recommend checking it out.",
    "44": "The whole 1 hour and 10 minutes of No Hard Feelings was pure entertaining and it's been a long time since we've got this type of adult comedy movie again after We're The Millers, and while at the end it fell to it became way too long and uninterested in the last 30 minutes, No Hard Feelings was still pretty fun mostly carried by not only Jennifer Lawrence but also Andrew Barth Feldman that are legit good in this movie, and so do the rest of the cast and my favorite supporting character played by Scott MacArthur, No Hard Feelings overall wasn't the best at anything, it's not like funniest movie i've ever seen even in a long time, it was not something special in terms of story, but sure is entertaining for the most part, and i enjoyed it.",
    "45": "From the writer who bought you \"good boys,\" \"the office,\" and \"bad teacher.\" This is easily the best movie of Jennifer Lawrence's career. We laughed throughout it and there were some really brave moments including the beach fight scene. I felt like the writer's really missing opportunity for some great Ferris Bueller jokes like maybe a poster from the movie on the kids wall of his bedroom or some humor related to Ferris Bueller like the kid calling his dad Burller or maybe Broderick saying \"I was a handfull in high-school\" with the movie theme music \"Oh yeah\" in the background. Overall a great movie about a train wreck of a person just trying to make life work. Very depreciating humor and Also made fun of today's entitled telephone captured culture. So it opening night with a dozen people in the theater. 2 thumbs up!",
    "46": "Absolutely refreshing to watch a R-rated original comedy in cinemas. It's not until you go and watch in cinema that you realise how much we missed this genre.I and all people in cinemas in Melbourne, Aus had fun watching something original and daring. Jennifer Lawrence comedic timing is perfect along with new kid Andrew. Hope it opens more doors for original comedies as streamers have completed ruined the genre with Adam Sandler, Kevin Hart and Ryan Reynolds forgettable comedies every other month on streamers.If we want to watch original content we need to go in cinemas to watch it. Support it!!",
    "47": "Jennifer Lawrence tries to bring back to the raunchy sex comedy here, and actually I believe that this film did quite well at the box office.It's not great though, despite her clear best efforts, and the problem for me really came down to the premise and the amount of foul language that seemed to pepper each scene.It's all well played out, there's even the lovely Laura Benanti in a small role, but overall this just never really seems to work out whether it wants to be a full blown sex comedy or a more gentle affair, so ultimately it gets stuck in the middle and does neither well.If Lawrence wants to do more comedies though, that's fine.",
    "48": "No Hard Feelings32 year old Maddie is a barmaid and Uber driver in Montauk. Sorry, just a barmaid when her car is repossessed. Which means she is likely to lose her house for unpaid property taxes (darn those summer people and their holiday homes, driving up property values and taxes). But Craigslist carries an advert from a wealthy holiday home couple, offering a car to a young woman willing to date their shy, socially inept 19 year old Percy, and \"bring him out of his shell.\" By \"dating him hard,\" know what I mean?I hesitate to call this a romcom, because it's not exactly romantic. It's somewhat raunchy in the modern fashion (lots of bad language and sex talk) and, hooray, for once it has the cojones to put some bold nudity on screen, albeit not even slightly erotically. And the plot follows largely predictable lines, although not everything unfolds as expected.At heart, though, it is rather gentle and sweet as two people negotiate an improbable interaction with two very different agendas - Maddie needs that car, darnit, while Percy's parents are in much more of a hurry for him to lose his innocence than he is. It's pretty funny, with emotional backstory which helps to make sense of the improbabilities (the Craigslist ad was genuine, as unlikely as that seems).And it boasts funny, touching and likeable performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Andrew Barth Feldman. I liked it.",
    "49": "I watched this movie in it's entirety, out of curiosity. And I was more than prepared to turn it off, if it was too stupid.I liked the music. Some of the jokes were funny and clever. But many just fell flat. The general message of --- get to know somebody first before sleeping with them --- is good. Although I believe there is nothing wrong with bedding strangers if you find them attractive, or if you are really in the mood --- sometimes.But I thought the premise was stupid. Nothing wrong with helicopter parents hiring an older woman to bring their overprotected and inexperienced son out of his shell. But, the Jennifer Lawrence character comes across as too mature and intelligent to not just see this as a \"friends with benefits\" situation. As a opposed to an actual \"fake\" boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. She can mentor him, teach him how to deal with the world as an adult, and even sleep with him. But no need to pretend to be his actual girlfriend.I think the holding hands and kissing in public scenes were cringy, inappropriate and unnecessary. Older people and younger people become friends and have sex all the time in real life. But they don't hold hands and kiss romantically in public, if they are just friends with benefits.This movie is better than most stuff out there. But it wasn't great. The acting, the music, the cinematography were good. But, as is often the case, the writing is usually the reason most movies are --- not great, not good or just plain bad.",
    "50": "JLaw has never looked so good or been so funny. Her portrayal is authentic and without effort. The comedy is delivered just right to wrap you in with its heartwarming, relatable, and also sad underlining tones.You're rooting for both main characters. It plays out like a book and is filmed like such but in a really good way.You'll laugh, have your heart strings tugged, and wonder how the movie will play out. It's also not too long which is a nice plus. It doesn't hit you with the boring king scenes or anything.Definitely watch it in theatres to get the full experience. Let me write some more so the review is complete lol.",
    "51": "Finally a comedy that give you that pre-2015 vibe.They make fun of the cellphone generation with their super sensitive can't take a joke / easily offended minds. That was great.-\nSadly the ending ruins it,\nMaddie selling her house made no sense!Whole point of the movie was that this was her hometown and she loved that house..... then suddenly she decides to sell it!-\nAnd that was right after she earned the money she needed!Which again was the whole premise of the movie!-\nAnd move to California even!.... The place filled with the type of people she cannot stand, as we witnessed the entire movie!And what will she do there?? Drive for Uber?They def. Should have come up with a better ending.",
    "52": "A difficult assessment. A typical RomCom*, although it's not really one, but then somehow also a special film, a tightrope act between having seen it 1000 times and having its very own touch. The latter is mainly due to the very good cast, both main actors with full throttle and obvious heart and soul, as well as the right chemistry. In the best phases, what is shown scratches at the indie film, *unrealistic feelings are never served up, artificial gag fireworks are never attempted. 100 relatively fresh and undoubtedly refreshing summer minutes, with some memorable moments. I think NO HARD FEELINGS could stand the test of time and stick, what speaks against it is only the quantity of outputs in these genre realms.",
    "53": "It's definitely not the funniest and original raunchy comedy we've seen on screen but it's probably one the best produced in the last 5 years with a palpable passion for this genre.You can hardly find any missing ingredient:\nHilarious and dark comedy moments. Direct and funny language. Sexy and even heartwarming scenes. Simple but meaningful story with the right ending.Overall a throwback in the essence of this genre ruined only by the horrible 2 minutes long trailer preceding its release... literally revealing every single funny moment.And YES - Jennifer Lawrence is/was a great choice for the leading role. Her acting feels so natural and convincing you can hardly differentiate it from her actual herself.",
    "54": "You know how everyone is saying there is nothing original coming out of Hollywood any more? No Hard Feelings is a prime example of that. You would think that Jennifer Lawrence would set her sights more high-brow, but here she goes for the lowest common denominator of comedy. You know how there are no brains to the straight-to-video National Lampoon 'films'? Those are like Citizen Kane by comparison. I'm not exactly sure why they call this a comedy, when the movie doesn't succeed in creating a single funny moment. Save yourself the movie and avoid this peice of trash. All this movie accomplishes is feeding Jennifer Lawrence's ego.",
    "55": "Who would give this a one star review ?All of the characters are amazing this cast was top notch.I liked the music and I agree with someone posting this movie was very early 2000's vibe\nThe only movie I've really watched Jen in is the Hunger Games I haven't really seen A lot of her movies\nI think she's freaking hilarious\nI found this movie entertaining and I am the worlds worst about sitting through a movie\nThe Kid that plays Percy is awesome\nI love Maneater I can't believe how good the music was\nI like how they did a nod to Ferris Bueller with the car at the end\nIt was heartfelt and funny as hell I thought.",
    "56": "I am in utter shock after suffering through that movie to find out, there are actually people who liked it! What? Did we see the same movie? It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.I love Jennifer Lawrence and I can't believe she did this movie! Why, Jennifer?! I like comedies, I even like raunchy comedies. This was just not funny, at all. The writing was awful, the acting was awful, directing, editing, you name it - awful.I'm trying really hard to find one nice thing to say about this movie. The boy singing and playing the piano was enjoyable, but then it was over and we were back to the nightmare of this story.Don't watch this movie!!!",
    "57": "I don't know why I was so skeptical about this movie, the trailers didn't look any good, and you could almost get the feeling of an unnecessary movie. But when I watched it, I was surprised! No Hard Feelings was a sweet, funny comedy about how it is to lose something and how to feel buried and prisoned. They also showed how it is to be ditched by a person that you really like. Jennifer Lawrence did the role with humor and she was basically the star of the show. Andrew Feldman did play well too, but Jennifer just made her role better for some reason. The humor and the action was surprisingly good, they were ironic, goofy, some of the fun parts were sexual, this is definitely not a movie for kids. The overall movie gave us a very good moral, and the performance was good, too. Maybe they could change some of the dialogues, but that is not a big deal. No Hard Feelings is a great comedy that is made for almost everyone, unless you don't like dirty humor like this. A movie you can watch a few times, I think it is kind of a movie like that. Remember that this movie is Rated R so not for kids, definitely a good comedy for adults.",
    "58": "This is SO beneath an amazing Oscar winner - this feels more like a B rated movie, and not a good one at that.Felt very inappropriate (although I know he was 19, it was just super awkward, borderline obnoxious - I was wincing through it), not funny, not endearing - just a bad movie with scenes that were beyond unrealistic. (Was shocked that Hasan Minhaj and The Bear's Richie made appearances - felt beneath their line of work as well?)Do yourself a favour and skip this one. (Although she looked fantastic). Any other Jennifer Lawrence movie is by far a better choice - I know comedies are tough but this was awful.",
    "59": "Something about this movie reminded me of a role reversal of Risky Business. It is a stupid premise about a financially trapped girl looking to make extra money to save her house acting as a \"Mrs Robinson\" to the lead's Dustin Hoffman. The disturbing part is that the whole scheme is conjured by this high school boy's parents-played by Matthew Broderick and Laura Benati. Andrew Barth Feldman is good as the awkward star. The movie is funny at parts, and but for the great charisma of Jennifer Lawrence the film would be unforgettable. It has a bit of a heart. It is funny and cute in parts. The Ian thing is it is never as funny as it could have been, bit still watchable.",
    "60": "So, after hearing much about this film some good & bad I wasn't too sure about this one at all. Nonetheless, I went in to see this...!The film follows Maddie, a 30 something woman who on the verge of losing her house, follows up an ad in which she'll be rewarded a car if she can date a shy boy named Percy! But, it turns out to be more of a challenge than she anticipated...!I found the film to be not bad, I was quite apprehensive about this due to the controversy surrounding it which I partly agree with. But this film was actually not bad & the eye candy Jennifer Lawrence was top notch! She is hot as!The story, pacing & runtime weren't bad at all at 97 minutes & the comedy seen here was pretty good! The actors do well with parts & while the story is on the icky side (no matter how innocent it might be), it wasn't bad despite some questionable scenes if the roles were reversed...!The comedy & even momentum loses it's spark by the latter half, though not bad, it was a slight niggle for me & again, there were some scenes which were questionable if the roles were reversed. This was despite at the same time, me finding some scenes ace for eye candy, humour & outrageous laughter!Overall, it's a film which I thought I was going to hate! I didn't due to the performance mostly by Jennifer Lawrence, the comedic elements & other scenes. This was despite going hand in hand with the seriousness of some of those scenes being questionable if the roles were reversed...! Nonetheless, it was a funny, raunchy film with a not bad story line despite the film losing its buzz by the 3rd act! It's 1 hour & 37 minute, evenly paced film you'll enjoy despite the ickyness of the films content...!7/10.",
    "61": "Disappointed and confused. Didn't laugh once. Not funny. Raunchy and disgusting. People around me said it was one of the worst movies of all time and I agree! This is not a RomCom. It's a disgusting portrayal of a smart man going off to college and then being decieved by his parents to start a relationship with a 32-year-old hot mess of a woman. There are at least a few references to adults having sex with teenagers. Having sex with high school teachers then joking the teacher went to jail, but that's ok because she married her student in the long run. If any 32 year old -man or woman- find it ok to accept a bribe to sleep with a teenager, they need to have a mental health evaluation. But this is ok, right, because it's celebrities and only just a movie. Harmless?This film also focuses on the theme of kids need to \"learn how to drink\" (alcohol) and lose their virginity before going to college or they are a loser nerd freak. Making sex seem cheap and impersonal. They have condoms at one point but in a bedroom scene the teenager is not using condoms, another great message. The character parents seemed not to care about pregnancy or disease, but rather their teenage boy they coddled all his life must grow up in the next two months before going to college.JL - wow, I can't believe she agreed to this film. She must love money and loves supporting inappropriate teenage/adult relationships. The age of consent in NY is 17, the character is 19. The 32 y/o woman is consistently pressuring the guy the whole movie making him feel \"less\" because he is booksmart and wants his \"first time\" to be with someone meaningful. \"Maneater\" was the main song.All around terrible and unrealistic. Portrayals of insanely irresponsible behavior with no punishment/repercussions. Silver Linings Playbook had a large age gap too and yes, people took issue with that. To say nobody cared is not true, that was over 10 years ago and I'd hope as a society we've learned much more in the past several years about child grooming and trafficking in this country. Yet Hollywood continues to glamorize the sexualization of kids.Yea, it's \"just a movie\" but I guarantee thousands and thousands or minors will be or already have watched this. I would hope parents would see the problem.They should have made the kid a college grad instead of fresh out of high school, still an age gap but they portray this high school grad as an immature child, not one ready for the consequences of all the various illegal activities in this movie. It's sick.Whoever came up with this idea should be locked up. It blows my mind that ADULTS write these scripts then shoot the whole film. Absolutely no decency in Hollywood.",
    "62": "One would never imagine an actress with such credentials could sink so low. And, throw in full frontal nudity to boot. Surely she doesn't need the money.

Her son will. That about sums up, so to fulfill the minimum requirement, I'll just repeat.One would never imagine an actress with such credentials could sink so low.

    "63": "I like some films with raunchy adult comedy and this one intrigued me so I went to see it with my girlfriend. We found it mostly funny, however as someone who has seen a lot of these kinds of movies before, I found the movie largely predictable with how it's direction/story would go (the person being lied to throughout the movie will find out they're being lied to and be angry at the main character but then they'll eventually reconcile and make up). Other than that, much of the humor landed and I thought Andrew Barth Feldman in particular gave a good performance. He's an impressive newcomer to the scene! While movies with this kind of humor are a bit old-fashioned at this point and while the story was predictable, the specific premise of the story was unique and a good idea for a movie. In general, pretty good!",
    "64": "Gotta hand it to J-Law. She desperately wants you to like her. So much so she is willing to go full front nude while being punched in the crotch. Not sure if the movie makers here were reading diary but I argued that we will reach peak equality between the sexes when a woman gets slammed in the nether regions. Here, they take it to the next level...Jen is completely nude and taking one for feminist everywhere.Joking aside, the movie is a bit flat. But will grow on you. Jen plays Maddie Barker, a listless woman who survives driving Uber to supplement her living. Which consists of bartending and having sex with random town visitors (as we find out, the men of the town are tired of her). There is a darker backstory to this which is revealed later as to why she has a home on an idyliic Mauntauk island. Most of it nudges at gentrification. In this Maddie is about the lose the house when she stumbles across a Craiglist listing which has some rich parents willing to give a car away in they would have sex with their 19 year old son to get him out of his shell. Can't blame her for wanting a car to work so she can save her childhood home.Yes, the premise is truly outdate. And I believe director Gene Stupinisky understands. He injects the movie with enough reality with broad humor to get a mix bag of gags. Which is some of its flaws as well. The trick is that the teen. Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman) doesn't know her seduction is to get a prize. So the typical shenanigans ensue (if you watched the trailer, the funny parts are given away). There are no surprises here. We discover he isn't just a reclusive teen, but also has a romantic heart. This gives Maddie second thoughts about her fleece.What I did love about the movie is that J-Law understands her place in Hollywood now. She allows her doughy body to be paraded around jammed into dresses that are way too small for her broad shoulders. And she has no self-consciousness towards that. The word isn't \"brave\" but she understands Maddie is a person who is of the vacation island nature. They drink, they have sex and they are sturdy people. Maddie is a survivor who has been living in her past. Percy, on the other hand, has never had a life because it was stunted by early bullying behavior along with overprotective parents (played by Matthew Broderick and someone who looks like but isn't Courtney Cox). Not a deep dive into this topic. But just a hint that he crawled away and didn't want to deal with humanity. Something I think says a lot about the internet culture.Believe it or not, they dog on the generation that no longer has fun. Can't get past their technology to live...and make mistakes, which Maddie does recklessly. The resolution is really wrapped up a little too nicely. Would've liked to have seen one scene where she wasn't seen as some older lady but seen as a bombshell by some of Percy's peers. That never happens.Some of the moments are shoehorned in. As when Maddie discovers her attachment to the kid. There aren't enough genuine moments to earn that moment where they solve their conundrum when the truth comes out. There is a callback moment with a car that drives with someone on it. That may be as deep as they would like to go. I understand though, early in the movie, you have to wonder if this will be a romantic relationship or something else. The resolution will probably make some really upset as to the time we invested here.As some other reviewers had mentioned, this isn't the comedy they portrayed in the trailer. This adds a bit more seriousness to Percy's issue and Feldman plays him as best as he could without being a complete incel. This is about letting go of the past. Which is something you don't see in a physical comedy level.J-Law plays wounded well. She has sympathetic eyes, which seem to belie the scrappy quality she also possesses. She grows on you. Though some poor writing moments make you remember we're watching a movie and not really seeing the real Maddie. A fine line to skate.Overall, a perfectly fine diversion. It's more of a matinee level movie. Or wait for streaming.",
    "65": "First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the movie I really liked it and I was so hyped about that movie, even though I'm not a fan of comedies. The plot of the movie was very interesting and kinda innovative. The storyline was very well written, everything was well-explained and the execution was very well done. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and really likeable. Also, the casting was really good and their acting was perfect (especially, Jennifer's acting). The filming location of the movie was fine, just a small town in America. I have to admit, the opening scene (first 15 minutes) wasn't very funny and it was kinda boring. However, the 2nd and 3rd act of the movie were both really good, hilarious and definitely enjoyable. The ending scene was kinda predictable and I'm glad there was a happy ending. Overall, \"No Hard Feelings\" was a nice movie, very funny and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, I'm definitely looking forward for a sequel, even though I don't think they're planning to make one.",
    "66": "Jen tries hard to be funny but it falls flat. She shines in the emotional scenes but comedy, she does not. I don't think it's her but in this movie that's how it it. As a movie it's dumb but dumb can be fun too, this however does not.The raunchiness and naked scenes do not add to being funny or sexy, it just feels awkward. It's neither American pie nor girl next door. It's in a weird place where it's just happening without any consequences or feelings.It could have been a better film even without the raunchiness. The whole raunchiness just feels forced and unnecessary.I would rather see the same movie, same people, same story, same characters but one that doesn't distract you with trying to be funny or raunchy.",
    "67": "I honestly gave this a 7/10 just because Jennifer was topless, woooow she is hot. But the movie definitely had some funny parts, I feel as though this could of been really good if the writing was tightened up a bit, but I can also say if she did t drop her top it would of been a 6/10, so cheers for Jennifer ! IMBD is so silly for making us write a essay about movies, sometimes you can summarize a movie in a few short sentences without writing a thesis paper. Plus no one wants to read 600 words on why Jennifer is hot, or maybe they do? Either way you can't go wrong watching this movie if your looking for something new to watch with lower expectations.",

The film's premise held promise, and I found myself rooting for those moments of comedic brilliance that never seemed to materialize. While the cast did their best with the material, the script left much to be desired in the humor department. It's a classic case of unmet expectations, leaving me wanting more laughs than the film ultimately provided. If you're looking for a side-splitting comedy, you might want to keep searching. The movie had elements of both comedy and romance, but aside from a few scenes featuring the couple, it offered little that was worthwhile. Overall, the film felt somewhat pointless.",

Luckily, she stumbles upon an intriguing offer - a new car in exchange for a rendezvous with a young man before he heads off to college. However, this task proves more challenging than expected.Directed by Gene Stupnitsky (Good Boys), the film features Jennifer Lawrence (The Hunger Games), Andrew Barth Feldman (Foul Play), Matthew Broderick (Ferris Bueller's Day Off), Laura Benanti (The Shade) and Natalie Morales (Abby's).This movie exceeded my expectations, offering brilliant comedic content and a compelling storyline. It boasts impressive depth and clever subplots. The acting is exceptional, with the cast nailing their characters in terms of personality, mannerisms, and dialogue. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a standout comedic performance that kept me grinning throughout. \"The scene\" in this film is truly jaw dropping (Jennifer Lawrence is stunning), and the movie concludes on a satisfying note.In summary, No Hard Feelings is a refreshing and worthwhile addition to the comedy genre that I would rate a 7.5/10 and strongly recommend.",

It will be sure to produce some good laughs, but the story is a little too paper thin and the characters a little too 2-dimensional for it to truly impress.It follows Jennifer Lawrence as 32 year old Maddie, who finds herself embroiled in a scheme to save her house by 'dating' a 19 year old at the behest of his parents.It's not the worst set up I've ever seen in a comedy, but it's not great either. Saying this, it does allow for plenty of comedic scenarios and is actually a pretty funny film, with numerous laugh out loud moments.As well as being funny it boasts two brilliant lead performances. Jennifer Lawrence is always brilliant so it's no surprise that she steals the show. I'd never even heard of Andrew Barth Feldman before, but he really shines in his role and plays it to perfection. The supporting cast is minimal, so it really is all about the two terrific performances from these two.My real gripe is with the plot. I don't think the emotional elements resonated as the characters are too poorly fleshed out. When the film gets bogged down in the emotional beat it slows down the pacing too much. I just didn't find myself getting invested in any of the characters, the outcome of the story (mostly because it was very predictable), or the emotional journey of it all.If you're looking for a late night comedy that will be sure to get you laughing, No Hard Feelings should do the trick. I highly doubt it will go down as a classic of the genre, but it does its job well enough.",
    "72": "No Hard FeelingsThis was a very light comedy built upon a simple premise, however underneath the carapace of sarcasm and tough language lay a really sweet and sensitive movie that looked at abandonment and over-protection.Jennifer Lawrence who played Maddie, was great and she developed a real on screen chemistry with Percy , and he was a really talented actor, they really got the casting right in this movie.Yes we have some slapstick scenes and I really laughed throughout this movie. I love Percy's helicopter parents, it really was a very well written script.It was so good I watched in twice and loved it. I giving this a firm 7 outta 10. , brilliant!",
    "73": "My Review- No Hard Feelings\nIn Cinemas now. My Rating. 1/10I'm not going to spend any time this review as the only positive thing I can say about it is that Andrew Barth Feldman who plays Percy Becker gives the best performance in a movie that I think is an insult to the craft of Cinema.The last movie I saw Jennifer Lawrence in was Causeway a 2022 movie that I thought warranted a respectable 7/10 rating.So I ask the question why would a 4 time Nominated Academy Award and Oscar winning actress like Jennifer Lawrence agree to appear in a movie that is supposed to be a comedy that I doubt would appeal to either a teen or adult movie audience?I'd ask the same question to Matthew Broderick and Laura Benanti who are both very talented stage and screen performers who play a pair of dumb rich colourless characters in this rubbish .They play a pair of overprotective parents who employ a 30 something dysfunctional woman Maddie played by Jennifer Lawrence to seduce their young teenage son Percy .Percy is a socially shy and sensitive boy who mostly stays in his room apart from his part time job at an animal shelter.His affluent over privileged parents Laird and Allison promise Maddie a new luxury car in the hope that once their son Percy is bedded by the curvy sexually savvy Maddie who's life is in total free fall that he will come out of himself and be ready to go to college at Princeton.If this movie was placed in a time capsule for future generations to see if by some miracle we survive for another century they would be certainly understand why America has fallen into the abyss it seems to be in today.Can you imagine if the gender roles in this offensive scenario were reversed and these same over privileged dumb parents employed a middle aged man to seduce their teenage daughter in a bid to make her worldly enough to enter college ?Perhaps I just don't get it and I'm to old to appreciate the scriptwriter appropriately named Gene Stupnitsky style but in my opinion it's a stupid and offensive movie that is an insult to anyone's intelligence .",
    "74": "I admire Jennifer Lawrence as an actress and always enjoy seeing her on screen. Naturally, I looked forward to watching her in a new sex comedy called \"No Hard Feelings\", hoping for some laughs and a different genre. Regrettably, the movie did not meet my expectations, leaving me disappointed and uninterested.The film's premise is based on a viral Craigslist ad from a few years ago, where wealthy parents sought someone to date their introverted son and help him prepare for college. Lawrence portrays Maddie, a financially struggling Uber driver who responds to the ad and agrees to spend her summer with Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman), a nerdy 19-year-old living with his overprotective parents (Matthew Broderick and Laura Benanti).Although the movie attempts to be a raunchy comedy in the same vein as Superbad or The 40 Year Old Virgin, it falls short of delivering genuine laughs or emotional depth. The humour mainly relies on crude jokes involving nudity, bodily fluids, drugs, and sex toys that are predictable and lack originality.The characters in the film are one-dimensional and unlikeable, especially Maddie, who is supposed to be our protagonist but comes across as self-centred, manipulative, and irresponsible. Instead of treating Percy as an individual with his thoughts and feelings, she sees him as a project to exploit for personal gain. Similarly, Percy fails to exhibit any distinct personality or agency throughout the film; he simply complies with whatever Maddie instructs him to do without questioning her motivations or expressing his desires.\"No Hard Feelings\" fails to delve into intriguing themes or convey insightful messages about sexuality, maturity or relationships. It misses opportunities to provide humorous yet thought-provoking commentary on growing up under pressure from society's expectations or navigating love in today's world. While I respect Jennifer Lawrence as an actress, \"No Hard Feelings\" did not deliver the enjoyable experience I had anticipated. The movie lacked the comedic spark and meaningful content found in successful films of its genre.Rather than delving into depth and exploring new ideas, the movie settles for tired clichés and stereotypes portraying sex as a mere objective to be checked off rather than a meaningful bond to be shared. The movie conveniently ignores the ethical and legal dilemmas presented by Maddie's arrangement with Percy's parents, who essentially exploit their son for financial gain. The film fails to address the power dynamics and issues of consent that are part of this arrangement.The only saving grace of \"No Hard Feelings\" is Jennifer Lawrence's commendable performance. She puts in her best efforts to make Maddie relatable and amusing, with some chemistry with Feldman in certain scenes. Lawrence also exhibits her impeccable comedic timing and mastery of physical comedy throughout the movie. But even her performance cannot salvage this film from being an utter waste of time and talent. \"No Hard Feelings\" is a disappointing and forgettable comedy that does not warrant your time or money.",
    "75": "Ultra standard delivery, ultra generic writing, and of course all that adds up to, ultra predictable. It's much like a standard Lifetime movie you'd see on during the day, but with a glossy, but yet very trashy and sexually aggressive woman in it. Both lead characters are devastatingly pathetic, and this sometimes can work in a comedy, sure. But you know, it actually has to have some funny jokes in it to do so. In a half filled theatre, I heard a couple of chuckles here and there throughout the entire film. I can't honestly even recall seeing a comedy film hit an audience in such silence in the theatre in my whole life. And checkout my lists, I've seen tons of comedies in the theatre over the years.After seeing some of the Hollywood films from recent history, I really do wonder if they're not truly trying to kill the theatre industry for good. This film was unbelievably boring. Out of the maybe 4 or 5 even slightly funny parts, I think at least 3 of them are in the trailer. Save yourself, only watch this film for free, if you really want to see it at all. That's my advice, because this for the most part is just garbage! In fact, most garbage cans are probably more interesting than this film. I felt like walking out, I was so bored with it. I've yet to ever walk out of a film, but this one almost got me to do it.Hollywood is sinking to all new lows in the last many years in my view. The bar has never been lower, in fact at this point, they should probably bend over and pick that bar up off the floor of hell.2.5/10.",
    "76": "I must have seen a different movie or something because honestly I can't remember the last time I laughed so much!! Anyone who complains about the story being the same old story as in every other rom com or about the characters being too dumb is clearly missing the point of this movie - perhaps because THEY are the dumb ones?? Who goes to see a typical rom com movie expecting some super original storyline?!? That's like going to the grocery store and expecting to see brand new products all the time, every time, on all the shelves. Are you stupid?! Be real. No. You go to the store because you're hungry again and you want to eat your favorites. Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely effortlessly hilarious in this. I literally had to pause the movie multiple times because I was rolling on the floor laughing.There was a comment on here by someone saying that this movie is not like Titanic, Passengers, or The Hunger Games. Are you like actually for real dude?! Please go hurt yourself. No. Seriously. Go. Now!!People like that scare me. What world are we living in if someone is trying to compare a silly college rom com to the biggest movie of all time and saying \"Meh... it just wasn't the same\". Yeah, no kidding bro. I can't wait when that person realizes that oranges are not apples. Can you imagine!!One thing I especially liked about the writing was how everything was actually very realistic. Like, this could have actually happened. Not that same exact story but that level of crazy. It felt like real life, not just some dumb movie. It didn't feel like the actors were acting, it felt like they were real people and these were their lives for real.I personally hope that they start making more movies like this again. Absolutely 10/10 for me. Give it a try, I promise you - if you're a normal reasonable human being you will absolutely love this one. Enjoy!",
    "77": "No Hard Feelings was mis-sold to me as an outrageously raunchy sex comedy; it's actually more like a Hallmark movie, albeit with a few risqué scenes to make it more marketable. It's a good job that star Jennifer Lawrence is hot and gets naked, because there really isn't much else to recommend it: I didn't find the film at all funny, the comedy feeling really forced (a few people in the cinema seemed to find it hilarious, but perhaps they don't get out much).JLaw plays thirty-something Maddie, who faces losing her house unless she can raise some cash quickly. Needing a new car so that she can continue working as an Uber driver, she applies for the role of girlfriend for a wealthy couple's withdrawn 19-year-old son, Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman). If she successfully 'dates' the young man and brings him out of his shell in time for Princeton, they will give her a Buick.Having a gorgeous woman like Maddie throwing herself at you would be most teenage boys' dream come true (or any 50-something's dream come true, for that matter) and should be good for plenty of belly laughs, but the script fails to deliver, unwilling to really push the boundaries of taste. Instead, we get trite guff in which Maddie and Percy help each other come to terms with their emotional weaknesses and grow as people as a result. Gack!3/10.",
    "78": "Wow. But in a bad way. I cant understand why the terrific actress Jennifer Lawrence (who had previoulsy made a superb drama) now would lower herself to such a cheaply made teenager flick that FAILS to become funny for just one second.The bad; the really bad part about this movie is the opposing leading actor. He is just lacking in ANY kind of actor's charisma. Well, he has to play a complete nerd/dork, so does it matter that he hasnt got any actor's charisma? YES it does matter.Even IF a character needs to be a total looser, I still want that particular actor to be funny as can be, as endearing a can be, as sympathetic as can be. NONE of that is applicable though to this disastrous opposing actor of Jennifer Lawrence.Why didnt Jennifer Lawrence demand a much better opposing actor? At least it would have saved some of this movie...Terrible cast (except for Jennifer Lawrence ofcourse). Cringeworthy story. NOT funny from start till finish. What a disaster.",
    "79": "A girl on the verge of bankruptcy, doing two jobs to clear of her debts, badly needs a car to continue working as an Uber driver. She comes across an ad sent out by parents of a shy, socially awkward 19 year old boy to date him, have sex with him to help him come out of his shell with a car being a prize in exchange. How tries to seduce him and eventually befriends him, to learn to come out of her own shell forms rest of the story.The screenplay is as predictable as the story is. Jennifer Lawrence as Maggie is too big / good an actress for a film like this and sue gives it everything. I couldn't stop thinking why the film isn't doing the same for her. The barely funny scenes are scattered throughout and it ends up as neither a sex comedy nor a romantic comedy. I couldn't buy Percy as this socially awkward kid, whatever justifications they provided to establish his character as such, was just not enough.The screenplay really was in dire need of raunchy comedy scenes, slapstick even. Apart from the house party scene with woke teenagers pulling out their mobiles to film, no other scene stood out. The double entendre worked mostly because of Jennifer Lawrence in the beginning. With several characters wasted including not just Matthew Broderick but also Milo, who could've been easily used in a proper comedy scene in the second act atleast.No Hard Feelings in the end just ends up being a misfire with Jennifer Lawrence trying hard to save this mess of a film. She clearly deserved better.",
    "80": "I watch the trailer for this movie about 12 times. Sure ill admit at least 3/4 of that was because it was playing as a youtube ads but since i was super eager to see it, i let it run often when it popped.I love the raunchy comedies that were legions in the 2000s and first half of the 2010s. Then the woke movement happened and it killed pretty much the genre entirely as you must not offend anyone and can't do anything unapropriate these days.. Could this movie finally be a new modern take at this almost gone genre? Not really...even if it does take a few risks.From the look of it, it had a bit of a \"The Girl Next Door\" vibe as that awkward nerd who hang out with a hot chick. But thats about as close as it get.The funniest jokes or awkward situations were actually pretty much all shown in the trailers and the rest of the movie is more leaning on the romcom/drama side. Don't get me wrong, its still a good movie and a good story, but its nowhere as raunchy or funny as i taught it would be.Some of the comedy involve Maddie (Jennifer Lawrence) being somewhat of a fish out of water in presence of university students but the movie kinda portray her like she was 45 or something. I mean its Jennifer Lawrence... she may not be 20 anymore, but she look hot as... and not \"old\" at all. It does make for a few midly funny jokes and the movie poke a bit of fun at the woke/cancel culture wich i enjoyed, but i think there was a lot more funny potential in that particular part of the movie.Were my expectations too high or the movie simply do not realize its potential? I can't say. Its one of the rare case where i can say i enjoyed it, i am glad i saw it, but i would had change a lot of things in that script personally to make it much wilder.",

She has one summer to make him a man or die trying.CastJennifer Lawrence and Matthew Broderick shine.VerdictI remember when the trailer and premise were released and everyone started calling this the \"Groomer\" movie because of the concept and age difference between the leads. I don't get that, is the younger party legal? Yes. So what's the problem? Why do we frown on age differences? Regardless the movie wasn't slated as hard as I expected, people I guess watched it and got over their absurd hangups.But is it in any good? In my opinion it's an average movie, it has yays it has nays but the age thing isn't a factor.It's sweet and endearing, everyone does a decent job and it has a solid though somewhat predictable ending.On the flipside a lot of the humour (Especially the physical stuff you'd expect more from Melissa McCarthy) is cringe inducing. It's not funny, it's silly. I expect that stuff from a comedy 20-30 years ago, not today.It's a harmless watch, but go in expecting something nice but dated.RantsWhy did Jennifer Lawrence look so, orange? So made up? So, ridiculously pampered in this film? She's dolled up to the hilt and with a grade 9 faux tan on as well so we took in my opinion one of the most beautiful women on the planet and made her look like the offspring of a Kardashian and a Trump. And that nude scene? She claims there was no stunt double but why did the thing look so crazily choppy and CGI?BreakdownSweet in places\nDecent performances\nInteresting concept\nCertain story elements make little sense\nPhysiscal humor is offensively dumb.",
    "83": "I get that the trailers might have misled others including me, but in my quest to find a comedy to watch with my wife, this ended up working decently.A quick quirky take - this film made me think of Chris Farley. I know it's a stretch, but it had that sort of embracing a ridiculous scenario with charisma by the lead, and in VERY different ways Farley and Lawrence use their bodies for laughs here.Pop in plenty of cameos. Natalie Morales and Scott MacArthur were hilarious as the best friend couple of Lawrence's character - I could have watched a whole film involving just those three.The film masquerades as a teen sex romp, but is more of a jab at helicopter parents (duly noted, thank you!) and then of course a coming of age and later-age tale. The ugly duckling gets their wings, and a 30-year-old teenager and a 17-year-old take agency in their own lives.As usual, and with Farley films, working its way to a moral/conclusion tends to wring out the jokes....so the film started very funny, and then did indeed move towards Hallmark territory as at least one other reviewer noted.Mildly interesting to me that this was written and directed by a male. Should it matter? No of course not, but could that have led the film away from a simple modern \"women behaving badly\" kind of movie? Nah.... I think Amy Schumer could have written and directed an even funnier film, but I for one was glad that this film did not rely on raunch to make me at least laugh.",
    "84": "No Hard Feelings is a new comedy directed and co-written by Gene Stupnitsky. After the film Good Boys, this is only the second film he has directed. He based this movie on a real ad that was on Craigslist.Maddie Barker (Jennifer Lawrence) is on the verge of losing her family home, unable to pay her debts and other expenses. This is why she responds to the ad she sees on Craigslist. In the ad, Percy Becker (Andrew Barth Feldman) asks his parents if anyone can help their son grow older and feel more confident. This should be done before he goes to university so that he can cope more with this more mature world. Although this is only the second film Gene Stupnitsky has directed, he has written other film scripts for it. Many of his previously written stories have a similar core story to this film. Because of this, this movie may seem a bit repetitive to people who are familiar with his previously written movies like Bad Teacher. Co-writer John Phillips is also somewhat repetitive as a writer compared to his other written film script Dirty Grandpa. Because of these repetitions, the comedy from this film also remains a bit on the familiar side, so there is not much to laugh about anymore. The further comedy also seems to come more from adult cartoons. In addition, the decisions that the character makes are also not realistic, which loses credibility and makes it seem a bit stupid instead of comical. The characters don't really change much during the story either. Jennifer Lawrence, her character, continues to be someone who only seems more after money to pay for her house and debts. Due to the lack of a good and clear background story about her family home and family history, this does not really interest you as a viewer. The help she tries to give Percy to become more mature, he also gets from other angles later on. This makes her character, despite having driven him in the right direction, seem a bit unnecessary. Andrew Barth Feldman does come across well and believably as a more shy person who could use a little more confidence. Other characters are only used for more isolated comedy scenes and then almost disappear from the rest of the film after these scenes. As a result, the credibility is also somewhat lost and the film also looks more like a cartoon.

    "85": "While Jennifer Lawrence is unquestionably the millennial \"it\" actress, she's much better known for her dramatic performances over her comedic ones. In 'No Hard Feelings,' Lawrence travels pretty far out of her comfort zone - all the way to Montauk - in search of an old Buick so she can uber in the summer.Sure, 'Feelings' is a cookie-cutter romcom if there ever was one, but it's also a social commentary on how messed up Gen-Z is as a whole. Andrew Barth Feldman brings this to life in his portrayal of Percy Becker, an antisocial collegebound kid who is the \"dating\" target of Lawrence's deadbeat townie Maddie Barker. There are plenty of over-the-top scenes that involve everything from driving into oncoming trains to skinny dipping ass-whuppings and getting canceled while crashing high school parties. It's as if Chat GPT was asked to write this script in a way that it would become dated by 2025.Despite its many quirks and generalities, 'No Hard Feelings' is watchable as a disposal movie (i.e., on Netflix).",
    "86": "Sometimes a movie trailer looks really promising. And the movie disappoints. Does it happen the other way around? I guess one good thing about not doing this for a living is that I never have to watch something that doesn't look good. I saw the scene where Jennifer Lawrence's Maddie is trying to convince the parents that she's is right for the \"job\" of bringing their son out of his shell on Netflix and my reaction was \"No, thanks.\" But then someone recommended it and I decided to give it a try.Sometimes a trailer has all the best scenes and there's not much good left in the rest of a movie. In case of No Hard Feelings it's the other way around. The trailer covers most of the worst scenes. All that dumb, raunchy, \"may I see your wiener... your dog\" stuff. And what's left is a heartfelt story about two people coming of age, even though they are both adults and one is supposed to be \"mature\". Maddie in that scene with the parents is nothing like she is in the rest of the film. Jennifer Lawrence is so good at this gradual, bit by bit, reveal of the vulnerable goodness that hides underneath Maddie's brash, rowdy exterior. She gives the movie its heart. It would be dead without it.",
    "87": "As you can probably guess if you've seen the trailer, this is a crude sexual comedy. It follows an older woman who agrees to date a socially awkward teen in exchange for funds. Here's everything wrong with it:-The sexual content is cringey (there's really nothing funny about an adult pressuring a teenager into sexual activity they clearly don't want).-The storyline is overdone (there are a million movies about charming, hot women pursuing awkward teenage boys and about people faking relationships for money).-It's not funny (there are a few laugh out loud moments, but most of the humor isn't funny or just plain nonsensical and stupid).Jennifer Lawrence has really reached a low point in her career for doing this. That's all I have to say.",
    "88": "Jennifer Lawrence falls from grace by doing this sophomoric comedy that lacks real comedy. Watching the promos and commercials, this plays out as a coming of age comedy but we get a poor film that takes a serious social issues and tries to make light.Parents concerned about their social awkward child is a real concept but the route this movie takes it's almost an abuse as a resolution. The 'craigslist' approach to trade for social awkwardness is both dangerous and poor parenting.Then Jennifer Lawrence, an actress that was an Oscar worthy actress, tries her hand at comedy and comes out as cringeworthy and disingenuine.Comedies are slowly dying out for raunch and low brow romps. It fails to be a true comedy and it really doesn't have that background feel good moment.Many are claiming this is a return of raunchy comedies which is sad if this is the gold standard.Matthew Broderick, who starred in one of the best comedies Ferris Bueller's Day Off, reduced to this farce of a dad who is concerned for a real behavior awkwardness with a negligent response. Overall, no real likeable characters. Only resolution for a simple problem is with a sick and unlawful isn't a good feel good story but quite the opposite.",

A sheltered quite shelled up boy named Percy(Andrew Feldman) needs some adventure before college, and his parents put an ad for a female companion with the reward a car. Now enter Maddie(in a very sexy turn from Jennifer) who's a go against the grain cash strapped young lady trying to save her deceased mother's house and hold on to a car, who's an adventure seeker and experienced under the sheets. The film is funny as the two meet and get to know one another and break waves the beach scene is wild on a hot summer night as you see the beautiful body of J. Law! And Maddie is a sexy colored bra wearing gal I loved her multi colored yellow one, along with the brown like strapless one, also she sported a pink and green one! It's like she had a Victoria Secret's drawer full of colored bras, that was an eye candy treat! Anyway despite all the funny sexy scenes this film is a coming of age story where a young man grows up with connection and discovery while a young lady is set free! Overall good enjoyable heartfelt film.",
    "90": "No pun intended - and while the trailer may have looked quite ... well out there to put it mildly - the movie itself has quite some gravitas. It works on many levels and some of them are ... well dramatic. So while you may be in the age shaming group (the movie is aware of Lawrence age - and her characters that is), there is more here than meets the eye. It is about baggage - not that kind. From earlier in your life and how you deal with stuff. That goes for both main characters by the way.J-Law (as I like to call her - no relation to J-Lo of course) is a great actress, even if she may have had some work done (allegedly Botox?) - that shouldn't matter. A friend of mine noticed more than me - just in case that may be an issue with you.Another things that you may have issues with: the movie is quite offensive! Be it with the language (foul) or even nudity. Though it looks like they did some CGi with the latter - I was surprised either way. Can't be too sensitive when it comes to those issues though ... a comedy with heart - and something you can watch with your partner!",
    "91": "Olour me impressed, or maybe I just have a thing for films set in beachtowns. This one unravels in Montauk, a hamlet within the state of New York, known for its touristy summers.

It's about 32-year-old Maddie (a sizzling Jennifer Lawrence) trying to date 19-year-old Percy, in exchange for a car from his helicopter parents. JLaw's performance is a stark reminder that she needs to be cast a lot more in romantic/sex comedies. She's got the charm, the comic timing, and the looks.The chemistry she shares with Andrew Barth Feldman is mostly what keeps the movie afloat - well, that plus the funny lines the film throws at you when you least expect them. The slapstick elements are what didn't really excite me (except for that \"suplex\", DAMN, that was SMOOTH AF) - the same struggled to work for me in Stupnitsky's Good Boys. Apart from the two leads, the writing doesn't lend much texture to the supporting characters; therefore, their small joys and victories don't seem to matter to us as much. Neither is the script interested in throwing any curveballs. That said, I totally had fun watching immature millennial JLaw snubbing Gen Z nerds and their \"random wokeness\" in a party scene, minus the physical joke at the very end of it.P. S - I think this would've had a lot of fun outtakes. Why didn't they show 'em in the end credits?",

If she succeeds, she'll get a cherry Oldsmobile as payment from his parents, Laura Benanti & Matthew Broderick, as long as she doesn't have to sleep w/him & not divulge the scheme to Feldman either. What follows is a series of misadventures & mishaps as Lawrence tries to seduce the noob (as far as she can w/o violating any carnal knowledge) hoping to achieve her goals w/Feldman being ready for his next step in life fully prepared. When the most one can say about this yukker is that the steady sweet hands of the Farrelly brothers are sorely missing, you know you have a stinker on your hands w/much of the comedy so forced since it relies on smart people suddenly doing dumb things to elicit a laugh over & over again. And about that nude Lawrence fight she has w/some thieves who steal her & Feldman's clothes while they skinnydip in the ocean at night, to paraphrase the Red Letter Media Guys, not for this one, baby. Also starring Natalie Morales as Lawrence's friend, Ebon Moss-Bachrach (from the FX's Bear) as a jilted lover, Hasan Minaj as a crafty realtor, SNL'er Kyle Mooney as a babysitter & Zahn McClarnon (currently hitting it out the park on AMC's Dark Winds) as a lawyer friend of Lawrence's.",

Of course, events unfold very hilariously at times (Lawrence is well at home in a comedy) and very sweetly at other times, and Maddie, originally in it because she needs the car to get to her bartending gig to keep afloat financially and much older than Percy, begins to develops real feelings for him. Hardly a spoiler to write that - you see it coming a mile away, pretty much as soon as the film's premise is set.No Hard Feelings is a comedy very much in the mould of your early-to-mid 00's teen comedies like American Pie, Road Trip, Van Wilder and even The Girl Next Door, in which, though there are some raunch scenes, the movie has it's sweet and sentimental moments. For mine, it was a good meshing of both. There are some very funny scenes throughout and at the same time, the chemistry between Lawrence and Barth Feldman is off the charts. Of course, there is the final third of the movie spanner in the works, but that is to be expected as well. A satisfying ending, too.An easy, fun film (if a little on the enjoyably dumb side) to wile away the best part of two hours when you don't want a movie that's too complicated or serious. As other reviewers have noted, they rarely make films like this one anymore.",

    "95": "I liked \"No Hard Feelings\" more than I thought I would. It got more than a few chuckles out of me. It's not screamingly hilarious, though what comedy is? I can't even remember the last comedy I liked. It also felt almost touching, though never preachy, and there was no modern-day SJW crap, thankfully.The plot is not exactly unfamiliar, in fact I'm pretty sure there was a Matthew McConnaughey movie with the same set-up: desperate parents pay a woman to date their son and force him to grow up. Here, though, the son is 19, and is made into a genuine, lovable character who I kind of cared about. I couldn't believe that the movie never rolled its eyes at him despite him being young, white and male.I had a harder time believing J-Law's character, to be honest. She's the typical bad b*tch that lots of comedies get these days, sassy and irascible and out of control. She sort of gets a conscience late in the movie, though it seemed too late, and her interactions with characters at the beginning of the film lacked too much feeling for us to believe she'd go to bat for them later in the movie.I also have to wonder about the scene that got this movie attention in the first place. It caused me to remark to myself how just because something is unexpected, that doesn't make it funny. It was more surreal, not funny or shocking, to see Lawrence emerge naked from the ocean and attack some teenagers like a sea hag.Barth, the kid who played... the kid, really earns our respect in this flick, and our sympathy. And, what is sorely lacking for young men these days: our empathy.J-Law, on the other hand, not so much. She's got the comedic chops, but the veers into pathos toward the end just seemed to come from a different movie.The movie also has an almost unrecognizable Matthew Broderick. So that's what happened to him? And Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who played one of the long-suffering boyfriends on Lena Dunham's \"Girls\".Whatever. \"No Hard Feelings\" passed the time, and was better than I thought it would be, though I doubt I'll remember much about it.",
    "96": "Brace yourself for a scorching tale that blends unexpected romance, modern-day disconnect, and coming-of-age in the hilarious film, 'No Hard Feelings.'As Nelly famously sang, 'It's getting hot in here,' and this story sizzles with a twist on the classic 'hot' girl and 'nerd' trope.Prepare for a wild ride filled with uncomfortable yet uproarious moments that will keep you hooked.In today's tech-savvy world, where virtual connections often trump real-life interactions, our protagonist, an awkward teenager on the cusp of college, finds himself in need of a feminine touch to break free from his shell. Enter Maddie Barker, a troubled 'hot' girl with a penchant for fleeting encounters and haunted by childhood traumas. Will she be able to turn Percy out?The film masterfully weaves delightful and cringe-worthy scenes that capture the essence of the characters' awkward dynamic. Jennifer Lawrence shines as the experienced yet forceful Maddie Barker, while Andrew Barth Feldman brings his nerdy timidity to life as Percy. The mix of awkwardness and rated R humor will have you in stitches.And brace yourself, as Jennifer Lawrence delivers a scorching, too-hot-to-handle moment that will leave you breathless.One standout scene portrays a fallout that exposes the gaping generational divide, resulting in a slew of hilarious old-age jokes and incessant cellphone usage. Speaking of pulling out, this film will have you captivated from start to finish, as it explores the contrasting worlds of maturity and experience. While a few plot holes exist, the movie culminates in a satisfying conclusion, although it leaves you yearning for something more.Ultimately, 'No Hard Feelings' reminds us that hurt people often hurt others, but in this case, it's all in good fun. If you revel in inappropriate humor, candid discussions about sex, and the awkwardness that accompanies it, this film is a must-watch. I'd give 'No Hard Feelings' a solid rating of 3.5 stars out of 5, guaranteeing a rollicking comedy experience.",
    "97": "While the trailers led up to believe this would be a \"Oh, how the mighty have fallen\" raunchy teen comedy featuring Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence, it turned out to be a lot more.It's funnier than expected, with both verbal humor and well-done physical slapstick. Lawrence, bless her heart, is game for the pratfalls and very funny.Very nice supporting turn by Matthew Broderick as an overly doting father.Lots of layers to the film, which showed some skill. Background characters that seemed like mere throwaways were revealed to have depths beyond merely being comic foils.And speaking of depths, the film is really about about two people (of different ages) who are given the opportunity to grow up, and it convincingly and humorously charts that journey.A lot better than the trailer would lead you to believe, and skillfully made. A very enjoyable \"movie\" experience, without the icky factor so many of these \"coming of age\" comedies contain.",
    "98": "This movie was such a delight. I thought it was very funny. It was a blast to watch, I thought the casting was great, and the chemistry between the characters felt natural.I think the 3rd act was just okay, and suffered a bit from the uneven pace. The emotional moments were not very impactful. I also felt as though there were some strange editing decisions (like scenes that needed music and had none, or adding subtitles in a montage with no audio). And lastly, there were some minor character inconsistencies, but that's a lesser of the flaws here.I think overall, even with it's flaws, this movie was super solid. I think it was definitely carried by the great comedy (both verbal and physical) but that's not necessarily a bad thing; it was a really good time. The story was at least somewhat believable, and this movie really made me nostalgic for 2000's comedies that they just don't make the same way anymore.People are way too hard on this film. It was more fun than I've had in a while at the movies.",
    "99": "I'm genuinely surprised by low score!Is this a classic comedy? Maybe not\nIs it funny? Yes!Instead of going to the other two big movies out at the same time we went to this film and we didn't regret it one bit.Jennifer Lawrence can do no wrong in this film and she's got great comedic timing.The concept/subject matter could have been gross but it's handled very well and comes across in a sweet-natured way rather than raunchy and dumb (though it has moments of both). That fight scene alone is worth the price of admission!I've recommended this film to friends and I'll definitely watch it again when it comes to a streaming service in the future.",
    "100": "This movie made me laugh and giggle, and it certainly made me feel. I cried quite a few times actually but it was nice. It tugs at your heartstrings way more than expected, and that's ok!I came in with low expectations and it ended up being more fun and wholesome than I thought. This movie feels warm and more of a coming of age story than a comedy. But not just for teens, for adults in their 30s too trying to refigure their life out. People have expectations that once you hit a certain age, you got everything all set up. Though that might be true for some, some have to deal with massive changes. Both internally and externally. This movie personally made me think about that without being too serious or draggy. It made me take a hard look at my life and wish someone would push me like Percy and Maddie pushed each other.Look, the movie is really simple. But it was told really well. It's like your early 2000s coming of age movies but a little more modern and polished.Watch the film on days you just want an easy watch. The scenery shots were a plus and it really takes you there too.",
    "101": "This movie was fun, I haven't snickered/laughed that much in a while, from the opening scene with Jennifer Lawrence's characters car getting toed to the last minute I did not expect it to be so thoughtful on the premise of living life like theirs no tomorrow and that yes your life can suck - your past was awful (family issues and the sort) but in the end you are the ultimate judge/jury/(and)executioner of your life. (So why not have fun?)So yes I did say this movie was great but as with all movies their are a couple cons but with this one the pros out way the cons;Cons:\n1) it felt like some of the transition scenes were chopped and cut poorly.2) I really felt like this movie could and SHOULD of hit the two hour mark... I mean I feel like their kinda was some more situations that Mandy and Percy could of gone through. Like I would of loved to see a scene of the both of them schooling the fellow players in the brief 6 second laser tag montage, I felt like the directors would of been able to make a very funny scene out of the part.3) I would of loved for there to have been at least more comedic scenes between Matthew Broderick (Percy's dad) and Mandy, for me it's because I don't recall a movie from the past let's say 10 years in where I've seen him act in (or if their was one, one that was memorable.)Cons:1) story was engaging and fun.2) I like how they set this movie up through the trailers to be a rowdy comedy like American Pie but they instead flip the script and put a deep meaning to it whilst, yes keeping it R, but making it just edgy enough that someone like my mom would enjoy it. And not be faxed by any gratuitous sex or nudity and or drug usage which is a fairly common trope in todays cinematic experience - ESPECIALLY in the genre of comedy and drama (but I'll give drama some leeway because most times that's a very important part in those movies.)",
    "102": "No Hard Feelings (2023) is a raunchy comedy that, while it may initially seem to be heading for the typical, outrageous path of adult humor, surprisingly veers towards a safer route. It's a film that entices you with its unapologetic humor and then surprises you with its turns toward heartfelt moments.Jennifer Lawrence stands out in this film in a genre often dominated by male performances. Her comedic chops are impeccable, with her delivering lines that will have you laughing out loud. One memorable scene involves her character at a disastrous dinner party where everything that can go wrong, does - her reactions alone are worth the price of admission.But it's not all laughs. Lawrence flexes her dramatic muscles too, proving that she has an impressive range as an actress. A poignant scene where she confronts her past showcases her ability to seamlessly transition from comedy to drama. It's a testament to her versatility and reinforces her stature as one of Hollywood's most talented actresses.\"No Hard Feelings\" is a film that guarantees extreme laughs along the way. It strikes a balance between funny and heartfelt, making it a must-watch for fans of R-rated comedy that's got a bit of soul.In a cinematic landscape where films tend to be overproduced, overextended, and overplayed, \"No Hard Feelings\" is a breath of fresh air. It's a film that knows its strengths and plays to them without trying to be more than it is. With a 90-minute run time, it's a concise, well-paced film that doesn't overstay its welcome.However, the film isn't without its faults. Its predictability can be a bit of a letdown, and the sentimental ending, while touching, feels somewhat out of place in the raunchy comedy. The final act, in particular, feels forced in its attempt to pull the film out of a predictable tailspin.Despite these minor flaws, \"No Hard Feelings\" is a film worth watching. It's a testament to Jennifer Lawrence's range as an actress, delivering plenty of laughs along the way. Its mix of humor and heart makes it a worthy addition to the genre.",
    "103": "OK, so the underlying premiss here is pretty daft. The \"Becker\" parents - Matthew Broderick and Laura Benanti are concerned that their teenage son \"Percy\" (Andrew Barth Feldman) is just a little bit shy, and so they are seeking a willing gal to help get him out of his bedroom. Meantime, \"Maddie\" (Jennifer Lawrence) is struggling to make ends meet as an Uber driver with only a pair of roller-skates to her name. She spots their ad, they meet and next thing she is chatting to the young man who volunteers at an animal sanctuary. He thinks she's weird, she thinks he's weird - but she needs a car, and that's her prize if she can get him laid! That's what works about this film: right from the double entendres of the title, it's a sex comedy that doesn't actually shy away from nudity (albeit sparing) and from the fact that the parental goal here involves their son and cherries - and not those in bowl. Lawrence is on good form and she brings out the best in Feldman who is also quite effective as the scared-of-his-own shadow young man who would rather seek the comfort of four legged friends than people. It moves along quickly, the writing is enjoyably earthy at times, there are some fun, lightly comedic scenes and though no, there isn't really a lot of jeopardy to the plot, it's surprisingly easy to watch. It also can't but elicit our own memories of being a cack-handed teenager with raging hormones that we didn't understand nor know how to control. A fun soundtrack and I found it flew by. Television will be fine, though, no need to shall out for a ticket.",
    "104": "Hello from another Summer Day in the auditoriums. I was looking forward to No Hard Feelings, it has been some time since we have had a really good , hard R comedy. This isn't your mothers or grandmothers comedy, if you get easily offend or don't like sexual innuendo, please, don't see it; because I hate people who complain.Everything about this film was perfect. What I liked, there was no \" message\" no \" diversity\" hire. A fun rom com. The location manager needs to get big probs for the great locations used in a part of New York that gets very little camera time.We meet Jenifer Lawrence's character, who we tell right off hand, isn't doing well financially. Maddie works as a Uber driver and a bartender, yet her car gets towed... by her ex of all people. Maddie reads a job listing that states \" Date my son and you get access to our car.\"We find out that the son has social problems, rather play video games and play by the rules. They develop a odd friendship, both getting out of their comfort zones. The story is great, the acting and scenery is great, and of course, Jen looks great!!",
    "105": "With this cast and this director you can't go too wrong when making a RomCom for 2023.With \"No Hard Feelings\" it felt like I was watching \"The Graduate\" in a few scenes.Director & Writer Gene Stupnitsky please take that as a huge compliment.I went into this preview of \"No Hard Feelings\" expecting another cheesy, formulaic, romantic comedy, instead of the usual gross out scenes the movie took a pivot in the second act.Resulting in a third act that feels like a quality Indie movie.The creators could easily have slid into the DM's of a predictable modern comedy with all the usual tropes, but instead they turn it on its head.Don't get me wrong I still laughed out loud and even applauded some hilarious scenes, but \"No Hard Feelings\" also had heart!Matthew Broderick as the father, \"Laird\" (one syllable as it sounds) who placed the Craigslist ad to get his teenage son laid in exchange for an old Buick sedan makes a cheeky double entendre reference to his own hit movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\" when describing to the amazingly talented academy award winning Jennifer Lawrence his wish list for his 19-year-old offspring, \"Percy\" (Andrew Barth Feldman).Feldman himself is a genuine millennial who postponed going to Harvard to star in this film and I'm so glad he did.Andrew is perfect for this role of the nerdy, quiet, socially inept high school student on the eve of graduating to a prestigious University.One of the best quotes is when Lawrence's working class girl \"Maddie\" tells \"Percy's\" rich parents she will not only date him hard as her mum requested, but she will \"date his brains out!\".It's all in the trailer ,so no spoilers here.\"No Hard Feelings\" is a flick that's both not so pretty and at times an achingly awkward \"coming of age\" movie.Warning: Full frontal female nudity (not entirely sure it's really JL, because her head looked deep faked onto another female's body in the beach scene)\nListen out for: an awesome soundtrack of songs that actually fit the scenes on screen, unlike the usual jukebox of hits some film makers in Hollywood churn out.Watch out for: Miami actor (\"Dead To Me\") Natalie Morales as the very pregnant Sara. Her husband \"Jim\" (Scott MacArthur) is a bit of a dick and unfunny.If you need a laugh check out this movie about a 30 something who's own Uber car is repossessed by her ex-boyfriend \"Gary\" (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) to the tune of Tommy James & The Shondells' \"Draggin' the Line\" .\"Maddie\" needs money so desperately to pay bills to avoid losing her late mothers mortgage free home in a holiday hot spot that she dates a teenager.\"No Hard Feelings\" could be just the ticket for your own mental health day.",
    "106": "Low key quirky Rom-Com/Friendship Coming of Age comedy with heart, and supported by excellent across the board performances. Nice summer sleeper film headlined by Jennifer Lawrence who delivers excellence once again.Argument for Jennifer to get an award nod - She simply makes any film better by her presence, and her performance delivers. Yes, this film breaks the nudity-clause barrier for Jennifer, with a brief non-sexual scene integrated into the storyline, and takes that off her bucket-list.Enjoyable, heart-felt, and sweet coming of age film, with a some funny scenes that prompt chuckles.Highly recommended and one of the better films this summer to see.👍",
    "107": "This movie is so hilarious! No Hard Feelings brings out the best comedy gold when it comes to Jennifer Lawrence with her amazing comedy routine and her amazing beauty! It's \"American Pie\" meets \"She's Out of My League\" vibes!The story was good, the comedies and the jokes were so funny, and the movie has the funniest best moments, it also has heart, and brings out the best friendship moments.What I really enjoyed more is Jennifer Lawrence and her performance. Her comedy was so good, she was in action movies, and also some horror, and fantasy movies, but she's not afraid to stand up and bring the whole comedy routine to life on the big screen! Great job to Jennifer Lawrence and the best casting crew and director who made this movie so good for 2023!!!10/10.",
    "108": "Many times in selecting a movie, I'll give a premise a chance because of an actor I especially love.Seeing Jennifer Lawrence listed got me to turn this on, because she's got talent and has selected other projects I like.This was an exception to that.Lawrence's character, Maddie, failed to ever engage me as a viewer. I had some empathy for her financial problems, but the character herself was such a turn off that I didn't really care after a very short while.Maddie comes across as mean, predatory, whiny, entitled, and disrespectful of anyone but herself. So we start the movie like that and by the time the writers want to show her \"arc,\" and pull the audience to her side, I was hoping she'd be left in the ocean.(BTW, the beach scene was lifeless and without any sort of chemistry between the lead pair. Could anything be more dull?)---Meanwhile, I felt awful for Percy having such utter emotional losers for parents. But Andrew Barth Feldman's portrayal also failed to engage me and soon turned me off to his character, too.Percy is just as awful as Maddie, really, just in different ways.The age gap and premise got more wearing on my nerves as I stepped back more and more. There are other shows with such a gap in them where it becomes part of the background/useful in character or plot building.Here, with all the other storytelling components failing to get my interest, I had more time to fixate on the squickiness of these two together.Again, this is not a premise I'd necessarily have picked first choice; I picked the movie for the actress. HOWEVER, I gave it a good shot and there was nothing else really there to pull me along.---Therefore, I gave it three stars for managing to get onto the streamers. Even managing to get a movie done deserves that.And it will probably have a lot of JLaw fans making it through.But recommend it? Absolutely not.",
    "109": "Just saw the gorgeous Jennifer Lawrence fully nude and yep, still gay.This wildly unfinished, horribly edited, rough draft of an early-2000s hard-R, raunchy sex comedy felt like it was made from diehard fans of those. Too bad they couldn't recapture the two things that made those older movies great: excellent writing/jokes and actual heart.Sure, on paper, this had all the elements: It's a \"love\" story of two opposites in a relationship based on a lie and one or more parties may have true feelings past the ruse. Again, that's just on paper and you never really have true feelings here, with or without the fabrication.Percy, a 19-year-old-going-on-12 introvert, has rich helicopter parents who want their only child to get laid before heading off to Princeton. In comes the absolutely awful, 32-year-old Maddie who needs a car, Percy's folks have a spare and a deal is made. Gosh, I hope they don't actually fall in love because the relationship was built on falsehoods!As mentioned, she is just unpleasant and for the most part, I couldn't stand to join her on her journey. True, there are definitely established reasons for her actions and character, but that didn't stop her from being a drag in the movie.And to be fair, the male half of the relationship isn't all that special either. But at least he wasn't a terrible human being. He just wasn't all that interesting or deep. AGAIN, on paper, he fit the stereotype in these kinds of movies.Admittedly, there were a few, maybe half-dozen jokes that really landed and I couldn't help but laugh out loud. Unfortunately, the grand majority in this overall comedy just fell flat. Also, at times it was well shot and beautiful, and then other scenes seemed like they were shot by a failed film student. And overall, just like they were portraying the Percy character, the movie felt oddly...awkward. That was the word that kept popping up in my head. And not just because she looked twice the age of her love interest.But seriously, he did look like he could be her son. Think about how this would look if the lead liar was a 30-something male who looked like he was in his 30s and the target was a teen girl who looked like a preteen.There are SOOO many better raunchy comedies from the past ranging from Regular-R to HARD-R that I could recommend over this. And that's too bad. I really wanted to like this more, laugh more and feel something. Pity.***Final Thoughts: Just to name a few I'd highly recommend over this one: Trainwreck, Bridesmaids, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Superbad, Ted, The Hangover, There's Something About Mary, American Pie and Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle. If you accidentally watched No Hard Feelings, cleanse yourself with these superior comedies.",
    "110": "\"No Hard Feelings\" is advertised as a straight up raunchy comedy - and in a way, it is that. With overtly sensual jokes and double entendres that would make even the most hardcore SAA member blush, the film does go to great lengths to be adult, for lack of a better word. From full frontal nudity (I'll let you find out for yourself if that nudity is male or female) to jokes that consist of someone getting their most private areas stuck on a certain and specific type of puzzle, \"No Hard Feelings\" feels almost like a 2023 reboot of \"American Pie.\" At the same time, this movie is surprisingly sweet, and while the comedy never fully won me over, I found myself engaged due to how endearing the underlying romance was. So, let's talk about it.To be honest, I am no fan of Jennifer Lawrence; I've never thought that she was a particularly good actress, and to be even more honest, I don't find her particularly attractive. So, when the trailer for this movie released, the only thing that piqued my interest was how hard my cousin was laughing when we watched it together. None of the jokes seemed particularly amusing to me based on the trailer - however, as a self-admitted film connoisseur, I considered it my duty to go and see this film when it released. And I'm glad I did.\"No Hard Feelings\" is a charming flick. Very reminiscent of movies like \"American Pie,\" the film blends comedy, coming of age drama, and romance in a way that evokes a sense of nostalgia for those who appreciate the comedic stylings of classic sex comedies. More than that, though, the film has a great emotional through-line that honestly pulled at my heartstrings. I found the whole concept weirdly endearing, especially seeing the relationship build between Andrew Barth Feldman's Percy and Jennifer Lawrence's Maddie. In between the ridiculous comedy, they share some truly genuine moments - a scene in a restaurant featuring the song \"Maneater\" is a standout! And really, seeing their character development was my favorite part of the film.I admitted to not being a fan of Jennifer Lawrence, but even she won me over here, playing a young adult who is unsure of herself and of where she is in life. She nails the comedic bits, but she destroys the dramatic portions with acting prowess that makes me want to take a second look at her (in more ways than one). And Andrew Barth Feldman also shined in his role - I expected him to be very embarrassing and cringy, based off the premise, but he was really relatable and believable as someone who was falling in love for the first time.Look, I enjoyed this movie. As someone who has an affinity for coming of age dramas and teenage comedies, this struck all the right chords with me. It isn't perfect, but it's a sweet and fun film, and one that I will certainly buy when it comes out on Blu-Ray to watch on rainy days.",
    "111": "Snappy and sardonic one liners keep this comedy afloat. Jennifer handles the zingers well. Her character is likeable and sympathetic and her delivery is spot on. The premise is quite amusing. But now and then there are some slapstick physical comedy parts that fall flat like the mace and the being stuck on the hood. But the subversive satirical sense of humour keeps you listening carefully to the dialogue. Her costar Feldman is a bit too nerdy and puny, should have been at least adorkable. There should at least have been a sliver of chemistry.Except for the beach scene the story is not more risque or crude than average by today's standards. Did Jen really have to do that? Just felt sorry for her unnecessary sacrifice. Wasn't necessary for the plot. Shock tactic.The supporting cast could have used a more screen time. Laura Benanti and Matthew Broderick as the parents paying a woman a car to devirginize their son before college. They were underused.It was on okay watch better than some recent comedy movies.",
    "112": "So in theory I should probably be a bit more critical of this film. We've definitely seen plots like this done before, I knew pretty much where it was gonna go very early on and it's probably trying to be a bit more deep than it actually is. But I just had such a good time watching it that none of that really bothered me.Jennifer Lawrence is definitely marketed as the reason to see this movie but I actually think Andrew Feldman is even better and meant that I actually cared more about what was going on than I would've otherwise. As I said it's pretty predictable but it's still very well performed and it is really heartfelt. The main job of a comedy is to make you laugh and I absolutely did.We're definitely not as blessed with studio comedies as much as we used to be so it's nice to see one in a theatre and I hope it does well at the box office. I can't see anyone coming out of No Hard Feelings feeling like they didn't get the film that was sold to them. I can say confidently that it was better than I thought it was going to be. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expect it to be and sometimes that's more than enough.",
    "113": "I try to avoid modern movies as much as I can, but when I saw this I thought it would be some dumb fun for an hour and a half. And oh boy, I was 50% right. The dump part is certainly there, but the fun isn't.This movie checks all the boxes on why modern movies are atrocious. The ridiculous girl-power premise, the cringe unfunny attempts at comedy, the feminist messaging, the youngster who bosses parents around, the pseudo-dramatic subplot that has no purpose, the random character traits that add nothing, the \"edgy\" senseless ending. This movie has it all.The \"couple\" -- I use that term loosely here, it's more fitting to call the predator/victim situation -- has zero chemistry. The build up for any romantic comedy is certainly the hardest part, because it can easily feel forced. This one is the champion of all forced plots. Absolutely nothing makes sense.The boy is supposed to be timid, introspective. Yet, after a short while, he's not only quite comfortable with the absurd situation with the girl, he's able to sing and play the piano to a group of dozens of strangers, he also feels pretty sure of himself to juggle the parents and the girl at the breakfast table when he find out, and to confront his parents with the maturity and understanding of what should be done to help of an expert psychologist. It's beyond ridiculous.It also throws in random character traits that are just there for the sake of it. It's what modern filmmakers think adds depth to characters. For example, Jennifer Lawrence's character rides inline skates, supposedly because she doesn't have a car, and to make her appear more quirky or something. She rides to the parents house to accept the job, and when she gets there, she has to climb a set of stairs to meet the parents, who are at the top. She simply doesn't take off the skates! She tries clumsily going up the stairs with the skates on. They put it there as a comedic moment, but it's just stupid, there's nothing even remotely funny about it, and it actually drives you mad at the idiocy.The attempts at comedy are certainly ridiculous, but other moments can be just as bad. Like the fact that Jennifer's character somehow can fight off a group young bullies at the beach, or the fact that they expect you to feel sad about some nonsensical subplot about a couple having to move to another state -- they somehow try to make this seem like it's the ultimate drama; and it's just them moving.This movie is a perfect example of how nothing is safe from modern filmmakers. They are a source of corruption, devastating everything that is even remotely decent.",
    "114": "I was looking forward to this movie and it's exactly what you would expect if you had seen the trailer, I enjoyed it.The movie is about Maddie who owes Tax to the government and in order to pay it she needs more money as her car was towed and she's an Uber, she sees an add to try and coax a boy out of his shell and get him ready for college life in Princeton after Summer break.The movie is actually quite funny, of course there are some cringe moments all these movies have them but it's been a while since a silly comedy came out, it has a decent story and a nice little bit of heart but it's sole focus is to make you laugh and with some funny scenes and one liners I did laugh.I thought Jennifer Lawrence was great in this, the whole cast was good, I recommend, 8/10.",
    "115": "Flip the genders, a 32 year old man is trying desperately to manipulate an autistic 19 year old girl into sleeping with him.(Now they don't expressively state he's autistic but come on, it's what they are portraying.)Just imagine the scenes with flipped genders, a 32 year old man dragged a naked 19 year old girl on his hood just for them to end up at his home where he continues to push for sex.Yet it's funny because it's a 19 year old boy in this case? No, I don't think so.The whole premise of this movie is disgusting in all honesty and it's crazy how people are okay with this and you should feel ashamed.",
    "116": "\"No Hard Feelings\" is balancing on a tightrope between the clichéd and the unexpected. Going in, you might expect just another run-of-the-mill RomCom. But this film delivers more than it promises.Kudos to the cast, especially J. Law and Andrew Feldman, whose chemistry transforms what could've been another cookie-cutter movie into something special. At its high points, \"No Hard Feelings\" almost feels like an indie gem, sprinkled with a refreshing blend of genuine emotion and sharp wit. It avoids the pitfalls of forced comedy and artificial emotion, giving us a hearty 100-minute summer watch.The supporting characters aren't just cardboard cut-outs either. Matthew Broderick turns in a cheeky performance, paying homage to his own iconic roles, without overshadowing the film's fresh talent. What could've been a predictable, trope-filled comedy takes a turn, offering us a ride with layers and heart.Will it stand the test of time? In a genre flooded with titles, it's hard to say. But its unique fingerprint gives it a fighting chance to become a classic-or at least a treasured find for those who discover it.\"No Hard Feelings\" is more than your standard RomCom fare; it's an enjoyable romp that flirts with indie film vibes. It's like stumbling upon an unexpected hit game when you thought you'd seen it all. Not to be missed.",
    "117": "How in heaven does an actress like Jennifer Lawrence, who I already regarded as having the status to do nothing else but good/great movies, choose to do such a disappointing flick? I at least hope she had a lot of fun with it, cause I definitely didn't watching it.For some reason, when I first saw the poster 2 months ago I told myself I'd watch this movie. But on my way to the theater yesterday my expectations, for some other reason, weren't good. Surprise surprise, these 100 minutes still managed to disappoint me.Looking back, there's a couple moments that I grant as having been quite funny, and one as actually very funny. 3 quick moments... The rest? Excessive drama or plainly boring filling.Putting this film in the same resume as 'Joy', 'American Hustle', or even 'Passengers', 'X-Men: Apocalypse', and 'Red Sparrow' simply makes no sense at all. But I guess we all make mistakes :)Screening: 22-june-2023 9:20pm (Premiere), Lisboa, PORTUGAL.",
    "118": "I saw the trailer for this and was excited as I like JL and felt I'd not seen her for ages plus it's a comedy and it'll be nice to see her let loose. My reservation was the theme of the movie meant it'll be hard to be too good or not go too stupid so my hopes weren't high.But I was wrong, the leads had such great chemistry, there were deep moments and some really clever dialogue, for what it was it was surprisingly sweet and endearing but I can't help but think if it was the other way round that it'd be viewed very negatively.The humour was great, it wasn't forced and the film flew by, things were pretty logical, reactions were sensible and it was just surprisingly well put together and executed. JL was awesome here, I think she's extremely attractive but naturally which I thought worked do well, a plastic looking lead would've killed a lot of this.Very good!",
    "119": "A very sweet rom com well written . It's not perfect but it's not far off it never reached 10/10 but it never went below 8/10 and ended well .It had touches of American pie , graduate , risky business , weird science and even a bit of there's something about mary .It was well cast Mathew Broderick as the control freak father and Jennifer Lawrence as the temptress really played up to her role wellIt's an enjoyable film , warming with the main themes being friendship , shyness , coming of age , wealth , loss , love and sexGreat script , it was like an independent film with a big budget to cast stars to give it the draw to get bums on cinema seatsGo see it you'll enjoy itPad. A 9/10.",
    "120": "As someone who isn't typically a fan of American comedy movies, I think the highest praise I can realistically hope to offer this film is I genuinely, really enjoyed it from beginning to end.Channeling the same kind of humour audiences used to normally see during productions released in the noughties, Gene Stupnitsky's \"No Hard Feelings\" is a cheesy, yet seriously funny feature (I laughed out loud on multiple occasions throughout - something I honestly didn't expect to be able to say after watching), refreshingly not taking itself too seriously in the (wink, wink, nudge, nudge) execution of its intentionally nonsensical, tongue-in-cheek concept, but possessing a tangible sincerity nonetheless & actual heart at its centre (championing the loveable flaws of its imperfect characters) - ensuring we truly care about the emotional progression of the narrative's ensemble, amidst all the farcical absurdity, visibly taking place during consecutive sequences.Jennifer Lawrence utterly devours her role here too (as the protagonist, \"Maddie\"), flexing her natural ability to merit a laugh from viewers & it's also great to see her clearly having fun in the making of a production - because that in turn allows us to enjoy ourselves, since the entertainment doesn't feel forced on screen, at any time in the moment.Therefore, although lacking in any profundity, it's nice to just sit back & allow yourself to giggle, every now & then (for a few hours). Hence, this scratches an itch I definitely appreciated experiencing.Basically, I'd easily recommend. Absolutely check it out.",
    "121": "It breaks my brain that Jennifer Lawrence had never starred in an R-rated comedy before 2023. When she was the biggest movie star in Hollywood for a year or two in the early 2010s, her persona basically was \"star of an R-rated comedy.\" It seems so obvious. But this is her first outing in the genre (excluding arty dramedies). I really hope it's not her last: raunchy comedy is such a natural fit for Lawrence that she makes No Hard Feelings an easy, fun watch even when its joke hit rate isn't batting at an MVP level. Lawrence just captures the tone of the material so well.But I need not equivocate: No Hard Feelings is actually quite solid beyond the casting of the lead. The biggest hiccup is that it requires the audience not be turned off by its ooky premise: A 32-year-old woman gets hired by a geeky 19-year-old's parents to seduce him, take his virginity, and thereby increase his social confidence. Lawrence, and the film by extension, steamrolls over the edgy material with such a funny performance that never puts into question the tastelessness of protagonist Maddie's actions. She's scummy: we know it, she knows it, the movie knows it. Accepting that allows the film to function. Honestly, it's almost progressive in subverting the sex-hungry teen boy tropes.In spite of the eyebrow-raising premise, No Hard Feelings is, at its core, a sweet and generous film. Like American Pie and plenty of the good sex comedies before it (and very few of the bad ones), it understands that its hapless heroes are kind and humane at their core, their issues with their sex lives basically manifestations of their own cluelessness. By the end of the movie, not only has everyone slept with someone, but they're all the wiser and kinder for it.Starring opposite Lawrence is Andrew Barth Feldman, a gawkier and more adorable Timothee Chalamet clone. (He actually looks a lot like Rick Astley in the \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" video.) Feldman is clearly second fiddle but gets plenty of chances to be funny: He nails both the broad stuff, like a gag where he rides on a car windshield, and line deliveries on the fringes, like a throwaway about being upset that a restaurant doesn't have Pepsi. Feldman, a Broadway star, also gets to show off his musicality: He delivers half-funny-half-touching piano rendition of Hall and Oates' \"Maneater.\"The supporting cast is quite fun as well: Matthew Broderick appears as the rich dad of Feldman's character Percy and delivers some charming polite smarm. Natalie Morales, always welcome, is terrific as Maddie's pregnant friend. Hasan Minhaj is hysterical in one scene as a sleazy hookup of Maddie's.The film has one instantly iconic visual gag. Like Joy Ride from earlier this year, it weaponizes its star's incredible beauty with some unexpected and comic nudity. There is some visceral outrageousness in Lawrence viciously beating up snotty teenagers while au naturel that had me cackling.No Hard Feelings is hampered just a bit with narrative convolutions: The central premise requires a Rube Goldberg setup involving a car being towed by an ex, a bill due date, an abrupt firing, and a strange Craigslist posting all aligning perfectly. Yet it's not a very plotty movie: Plenty of scenes and characters pleasantly drift by. This is no tightly-wound screwball comedy. But it's engaging and breezy, and it moves quickly.Perhaps I'm too easy on No Hard Feelings because there's been such a dearth of R-rated comedies the past five years. But I do think it's a genuinely fun time, and I hope it's the first of many such pure comedy vehicles for a Jennifer Lawrence.",
    "122": "I never would have guessed I would ever see Jennifer Lawrence in a role like this. When the trailer for No Hard Feelings first came out, I expected it to either be a great comedy because she chose it or just simply a paycheck movie that was unfunny. Well, it's actually neither in my opinion. It's a very predictable comedy, but the humour is very good, and I laughed quite often. If you're up for some good laughs with no baggage, I recommend No Hard Feelings and here's why.About to lose her mother's home, Maddie Barker (Jennifer Lawrence) decides to follow an ad for a money opportunity. The task is to date Percy Becker (Andrew Barth Feldman), a couple's 19 year-old-son who is socially awkward and desperately needs to come out of his shell before he starts college. Maddie does everything she can to seduce him, but a real friendship begins to form, giving the film a little more depth. Their relationship is what holds this film together, so it's great that these two played off of each other so well.I've said that I never expected Lawrence to take on a role quite like this one and what she does here with what she's given is great, but the standout here is easily Feldman. I've never seen him perform in anything before but I will not hesitate to say that I can't wait to see what he does next. His chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence worked really well and he actually has some good acting chops. His quirky performance had me laughing pretty hard (the bar scene in particular) and he dialled it back for a few effective dramatic moments when necessary. I didn't expect to come out of this film loving an actor I hadn't heard of before, but well done.No Hard Feelings is the type of film that doesn't take any risks in terms of storytelling, but it tells its cliched story very well and I was smiling throughout. Yes, I predicted every single plot point which definitely took away from the film for me, but it didn't hurt my enjoyment while watching. With some very funny moments and a few dramatic heart-string-tugging moments in the third act, I had a good time with this one and I think many others will too. It's not a great film by any means, but I say check it out. No Hard Feelings is now playing in theatres.",
    "123": "As others have noted this comedy hits well and mines a field marked out of bounds by recent social norms, but it manages to navigate the difficult waters of social norms to deliver a really entertaining and funny story without judging it for it's social politics.Jennifer Lawrence delivers a character that is so relatable and believable, she pretty much sells the whole movie on her own. Her comedic timing and balls out delivery in a movie that hardly follows in the career footsteps of hunger games and passengers is just fun to watch. It ties in with what we've seen of her in off screen clips and she must be a riot to hang out with.Andrew Barth Feldman also delivers the right tone to steer this away from something cringeworthy and his comedic timing also fits perfectly.Also of note is the setting and location. Both beautiful and suburban sad. There was depth to the story and the actors really found the mark on this one. It could have been terrible, but it so wasn't.",
    "124": "It's a entertaining rom-com as a whole.It starts great and the first half is very funny and entertaining, but it loses steam in the second half, with a long stretch of 'drama', instead of 'rom-com', and it hurts the movie in my opinion. It tries to bounce back near the end but it doesn't recover the first half quality.The cast does a great job, the kid does great and Jennifer Lawrence is actually funny, but i think the secondary cast is the highlight (the parents, the couple friend, the tow guy, etc).So yea, overall a funny experience, just too bad it kind of loses steam in second half.Worth a watch."
