    "0": "\"Leo: meow\"If you thought the first half of \"Leo\" was your typical nail-biting thriller, you're not alone. But the moment Leo, Sanjay, Arjun, and Elisa strut onto the screen, it's like the movie forgot to take itself seriously. I mean, come on, the villain's willingness to take advice from a church father-slash-josiyar? That's so 'out there' it's practically in orbit!And let's not even start on the antagonist gang, Das & Co. I'm pretty sure a pet goldfish has more strategic prowess. Watching them attempt world 's drug domination is like watching a squirrel try to parallel park a car - amusingly disastrous.In my humble opinion, don't sprint to the cinemas for this one. Give it a few weeks, and you can enjoy the brilliance of \"Leo\" from the comfort of your Netflix account.",
    "1": "Movie is fully inspired from history of violence in 1st half and Loki is forced to inject LCU in it.So result is disaster!First half is kind of engaging to know what will happen to parthiban next and kept audience think about him which was good.Climax is the interval and after that story will just revolve around one thin line whether he is Leo or not.The problem is audience already knew that by interval itself. So movie can run without audiences as we already know what will happen next.Particularly Vijay's acting in Trisha's suspicion felt he is acting is good.. but we knew he is cheating and made us feel sorry for Trisha.In climax, Arjun's therikka dialogues were full of comedy and he is wasted.Vijay is killing 1000 people with no hesitation.But crying loud when he killed 5 people in cafe!!Style and mannerisms were copied from other movies and legendary actors.Overall if parthiban would have said the dialogue which I mentioned in the title in first scene itself. They could have released only a trailer and saved lot of money.Better luck next time for Loki to carefully write a story and hire some better writers.",
    "2": "Fantastic how the hero can exit a head on crashing vehicle at high speeds, through the front shattered windscreen, fall on the road, wrist first, and get up without a scratch. Any normal human would have had the head sliced open and brains scattered throughout the town.Oh. Also, a superhuman where he can ride a motorcycle with one hand, hold a heavy single fire rifle in the other and shoot with deadly accuracy and cause cars to flip on command. Not forgetting how he swapped from a motorcycle to a car seamlessly.The whole movie was an insult to physics in general and my intelligence as a human on planet earth.",
    "3": "THE ENTIRE FILM ID FAKE. THATS THE KIND OF IMPRESSIONS THE AUDIANCE GOT AFTER SEEING THE FILM. THE DIRECTOR INSTEAD OF MAKING A GRIPPING STORY AND SCREENPLAY DECIDED TO TAKE A STORY ON HEROS CHARACTERISATION WHETHER HE IS PARTHIBAN OR LEO. HE HIMSELF GOT CONFUSED AND CONFUSED THE AUDIANCE AS WELL. IN POST FILM INTERVIEW HE SAID THAT ENTIRE FLASHBACK MAY BE FAKE AS IT IS TOLD BY THIRD PERSONS PERSPECTIVE. THEN WHY THE HELL YOU ARE WASTING OUR VALUABLE AUDIANCE TIME. THE FIRST HALF OF THE STORY IS HEAVILY INSPIRED BY HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AS SHOWN BY DIRECTOR IN TITLE CARD. IN THE SECOND HALF THE DIRECTOR HAD NO CLUE WHAT TO TAKE AND HE DIDN'T USE ANY CHARACTER PROPERLY.FINALLY THIS MOVIE IS DISAPPOINTED ME AND WASTE OF TIME.",
    "4": "The film unfolds the events without any wasted runtime,focusing on building characters & environment,while the director manages goosebumps moment every 20 mins or so...keeping audience engaged...\nWhile the 2nd half determines the Overall impact of the film arguably leo too suffers so called 2nd hour phobia particularly the flashback portions was a drawback,but what critics say so that occultism aint exisist in christianity but its bitter truth that a person who is greedy or selfish about power & money doesnt fall for the religious authenticity or belief...\nThalapathy perhaps scores in every given frame effortlessly and impressive performance after \"THUPPAKKI\"...\nANIRUDH scores of \"LEO\" \"BLOODY SWEET\" & \"NAA READY\" lits up the cracker for a visual grandeur,u can't enjoy Leo without his contribution... The restaurant brawl scenes or the warehouse stunts sequence or be it a chasing bike sequence is a visual delight that praises Anbarivu duo supremacy,while Manoj paramahamsa cameras effortlessly explores the raw & rustic plains of Himachal pradesh...\nForget about critics or social mafias branding it as disaster...Also movie name could have been \"PARTHI\" instead of \"LEO\"...Later 2nd half mansoor ali khan says that hearing just a part of flashback portions u got stunned but what about hearing the whole story u will get blasted shows that leo movie onwhole is a chain of hint in so called LCU...\nOverall \"LEO\" is a mass entertainer which will break many boxoffice records.",
    "5": "I felt this movie is definitely better than Master but not upto Kaithi/Vikram level. More than 10mins could have been trimmed. The flashback scenes should have been shown as only glimpses because it did not justify the build-up. The build-up & hype for flashback was more than Rolex which the director failed to fullfill.Still definitely - 7.5 to 8/10\nGood to see Vijay is finally focusing on character rather than just flexing heroism.Villain character were not strong as the background music. Could have added more scenes to it to justify their ferociousness.LCU connect is just fine. Hope Lokesh has answers to all obvious questions from fans which may appear as forced scenes in the next part.",
    "6": "I would like to say this is a must watch theatre experience movie. We can see the best Vijay Film comparing to previous movies. I would like to give a big clap to Lokesh for giving a visual treat. The cinematography is brilliant and we can feel every scene and goosebumps overloaded. As always Anirudh was fire with his music. We can't imagine this movie without him. First half of the movie is very interesting because we get very much curious over every scenes. But the climax portion is not that much good from my point of view. The graphic designers worked very hard to make it realistic and also they achieved it. You have to watch the movie to find if this movie comes under 'LCU'. I'm saying again theatre experience is must for the film and if you miss that it will be a big loss for you.",
    "7": "It's a pure action entertainer with a perfect first half, followed by a decent second half. Except for the car chase sequence and the final action sequence, it was lit. I'm not saying those were bad, but they pushed the limits of physics and logic to the extreme. Other than some minor issues in the screenplay, I thought it was a pretty good movie. Personally, I loved watching the movie in a houseful theater. I don't know if it will be the same when it comes out on digital platforms, so go watch it in theaters. Not having high expectations will also help you enjoy the movie better. Can't wait to see the next installments in the LCU🔥🔥",
    "8": "Loki well directed and naratted a story ..special one for vijay fans and first half make me a high on lcu universe ...common audience u can't guess the story of movie but fully made-up of action sequence with rockstar Ani bgm will make ur mind Rocky. Screenplay graphic and specially hyena scene Tamil first VFX best graphic designers visuals u never ever scene before this is first and thalapathi he is always smart and cute ...he effort wordless ...really my heart felted every single shot of screen with vijay acting wahh..thalapathi career belongs to enter first 1000 cr box office collection movie history created soon .. I am trust this.",
    "9": "Wow wow, a total wow. Its an amazing pucca loki film, i am totally fullfilled of what the movie ,cooked by loki. Its an absolute piece of cake from History of violence. The action stunts were world class. Thalapathy , he is really back with bang after a disastorous vaarisu, this one is really a high on for thalapathy, welcoming him into the LCU. Wat an actor he just nailed with his performances, vijay for you guys. I have witnessed a different vijay from his usual films. Trisha, arjun, sanjay, gvm and all others did their role. It has an amazing connect to the LCU, which has been blended so well and not choking at all. Ani is the backbone of this film, he literally brings in the bones through his music. Leo a true hit, please do watch it in theaters. The flashback portion was a bit bored, but overall an amazing action block loki movie. Thalapathy u rock.",
    "10": "The writing in the first half: Superb, even when it's A History of Violence contextualized for Tamil sensibilities. Every scene carries a decent tempo, and the developments make you sit up. The whole hyena angle is beautifully executed, and its payoff in the climax is wonderful. The title card placement is a nice creative touch on Lokesh's part.Brilliant cinematography: Manoj Paramahamsa's frames wonderfully capture the Kashmiri locales (even though the film is \"set\" in Theog, Himachal Pradesh) with Parthipan's (Vijay) cafe looking remarkably aesthetic in that first fight sequence. When the film gets action-heavy, the use of the mocobot camera is put to fine effect.",
    "11": "Full and full action-packed movie. Unexpected cameos. Lokesh did a great job with Vijay. A new experience for the Tamil audience. Loved the film along with Aniirudh's BGM. Love scenes and chemistry were fabulous. Family sentiment worked really well. CGI's work has been amazing, especially in the animal characters. 1st half of the movie was a visual treat. Must be watched in theatres. However, we cannot see much of typical Lokesh movie styles in the movie. Sounded more like a standalone movie than an LCU-connected one. That LCU connection actually did not get connected well, Even though, the LCU references gave amazing goosebump movements. I hope Lokesh will address these gaps in LEO 2 if it happens. And we get to see more LEO potions in another LEO prequel or something which actually gives more clarifications of not just Leo but also Harold Das and his background and more about their superstitions or maybe something to do with Rolex I dunno and connection to LCU and the reasons for LEO to join the Ghost team justifications. Overall this is an amazing theatre experience a must-watch movie. Absolutely loved it.",

Some of the characters of the movie was characterless (no character arch) as we can understand that character need no big cast. A very slow Screenplay and same storytelling of an old hiding gangster story makes difficult to sit and watch the movie. The Bgm of the movie very bad and not bringing the movie up. Literally was searching for the Bgm while watching the movie. Lokesh should have worked more in the character arch of the movie, Sanjay Dutt & Action King acting space could have been more. A trully disappointing movie.",
    "14": "Disclaimer: This review is purely my point of view. My opinion may differ from yours. This review may contain very mild spoilers.Positives:\n1. Thalapathy Vijay: It's really glad to see Vijay in a classy performance along with mass moments that really worked well.2. SFX and VFX: Generally multi-starrer movies lack vfx and technical aspects. But it has better visuals (Especially the Hyena fight) and even better sound mixing.3. Action choreography: Cafe fight is the best choreographed fight in recent times with the edge of seat moments. Single shot fight in the second half really surprised me how it was choreographed.4. Cinematography: Camera work in fight scenes are of a whole different level especially in that single shot fight.5. Thoroughly engaging first half: The first half of this movie is staged perfectly and one of the best staging in the recent days.6. LCU connect (Will work if you don't have too much expectations)7. Chemistry between Trisha and Vijay: Generally, in Lokesh's film or Vijay's film, female lead will not be given much role. But, Trisha was used well in this film and still those scenes are really relevant to the content. We all know that controversial scene, you guys just watch Vijay and Trisha's performance in that scene. That was completely justified (Please don't come and fight with me for justifying usage of bad words in that scene and again it's my point of view)8. All the other supporting actors' performance.9. Post climax connect: I won't spoil it for you guys.10. Interval block at high point.11. Leo's flashback: Here my point of view might be different from yours and it's completely ok. People can be sometimes superstitious (Not spoiling much) and do foolish things. If you take it in that sense, then flashback works for you.Negatives:\n1. Second half: I won't completely call second half as negative. Second half was still good and engaging, but not so engaging as first half. (Again my point of view)2. Sanjay Dutt and Arjun was underutilised: Generally, Lokesh's USP is strong villain. But, in this, writing of villain characters was weak when compared to other Lokesh's films. But Arjun and Sanjay Dutt's performance was great. Just that writing didn't work for me.3. Vijay's character arc: Vijay's character change was not justified properly. More time could have been spent on this part.4. Don't expect it like Vikram: Vikram's screenplay had many surprises like Agent Tina, Rolex etc., But there isn't a much surprises that u can expect in this one. This is why Lokesh didn't want us to over expect anything to be LCU in his interviews. If you see it as a standalone film, it really works. I didn't have so much expectations, so it worked for me.5. One against 500: This is not really a negative. If you want this movie to be perfectly logical, sorry this movie is not for you. No one is perfect.Overall, this film works really well, if you don't keep too much expectations.My rating: 4/5.",
    "15": "A crisp screenplay especially in the first half. Second half felt a bit rushed, but the pace was there, gripping. A violent display by Vijay, which movie buffs never seen before. No cliché of actress or closed one getting killed. It was a pure gangster drama. Villains could have gotten a little bit more screen time since they have two brilliant actors on the other fence, same goes for the second half story narrator. But the director Lokesh would argue the movie is about the hero protecting his family. Out and out Vijay show, the intensity and stress was there on full display on screen. Didn't feel like any scene was unnecessary. Overall a brilliant film nonetheless.",
    "16": "Leo is not up to expectations, several trailers were merged into a single movie. Every 15 minutes a main character is introduced with hype which added some energy to movie so spectators can get some enjoyment. Villains in 2nd half is big let down, Sanjay Dutt and Arjun Sarja roles were not written properly. Only one of them is also sufficient for the movie. They don't have any strong reason to go against main character. Sister sentiment was not well established. First half is better than 2nd half. Vijay, Trisha and Gautam Vasudev Menon did excellent job, others even though big names dont have much to add to the movie.",

Trisha and Vijay just lived like a real couple...\nIt's a beautiful narration and a visual fanfare..\nWhat an extravagant sound mixing and BGMs. Every layer of the film has been layed out at the best possible manner....In a gist the movie is a all timer evergreen types.",

    "23": "Let me start with the fact that I went to watch Leo not once but three times in three consecutive days!First watch was extremly delightful due to Razor-sharp screenplay and racy action sequences! Second watch was due to find some hidden clue that connect this movie with LCU & Guess what? It was like i am watching leo first time!!Third time watch took place in theater equipped with 7.1 Dolby surround sound system just to enjoy the great BGM & Songs composed by modern rockstar Anirudh!! Man, it was fire! Each BGM is well synchonised with scenes🔥🔥🔥My suggestion: Go & watch it in the theater with the latest sound system, it will be an extremly unforgetable experince! Avoid the negativity spread by so called reviewers!",
    "24": "I'm a die hard Vijay fan and his acting in Leo was tremendously awesome! So much of effort and power! Now coming to the story, instead of casting maya krishnan and napoleon character to link LCU it would have been more intense if a bigger cast did the roles. For instance, Arjun dass or someone else. It's Vijay's movie!!!! And just them who linked LCU and the scene. 100 people going against one man is very backdated. KH voice at the end to link LCU looked like the director had to put it at the end because he doesn't want to disappoint his fans. I understand it's not easy to direct a movie and I'm not in a position to say more but this is just an opinion. Overall movie was good and my 10 starts solely for my thalapathy.",
    "25": "It was average at its best movie, which didn't live up to my expectations even after going without any expectations. I didn't see any good goosebumps scenes, and there was no Vijay magic. The plot was predictable, and each scene pointed to a sequel, but the current movie didn't have much content. I think the movie needed more story, better scenes and a stronger plot to be more impactful.Many of the serious scenes fell funny and didn't work, and the full plot revolved around a single question that was asked from 20th minutes into the movie. The music wasn't as good as Anirudh's previous work, and the fight scenes and car chases were too long and felt like video game scenes.Overall, this was an average movie that didn't bring the wow factor or make me want to walk out of the theater with that great heroic feel in my heart. Even the crazy fans who watched the first day first show didn't have anything to say after the movie ended.",
    "26": "Loved this movie. Finally a good repeat watch for a Vijay movie. A movie that finally shows a full length performer in him instead of all those masala style of acting. Lokesh kanagaraj is another master film maker. Engages in every scene and that includes fight scenes as well. Gonna watch it again. Songs placement was very good. BGM was a very big plus in the engagement factor, not surprised with Anirudh here. He's on a roll. Villains- no matter what they say, villains are a big plus here.. started with sandy n myskkin as the psycho serial killers. Then Anthony das who have a soft spot for his son and Harold das who can't be won on a full fledged one on one fight. Well played. Loved it.",

And sanjay dutt as a Anthony das and arjun sarja as a Harold das outstanding.. and Trisha Krishnan vijay thalapathy chemistry perfect matching... and anirudh Background music excellent.. each and every scene create goosebumps.. and every song perfectly create in this movie... Leo only theater experience movie its not small screen watching movie..... and hayna scene look like a original hayna... and vijay thalapathy intro scene mindblowing.... best action movie... pure mass movie..",
    "39": "After watching it first time 7 out of 10\n2nd time 8 out of 10\n3rd time it feels whole leo story is fake to cheat audience\n9 out of 10\nLokesh just playing with our mind 😂 for watch this movie repeatedly thats why he mentioned audience will watch this movie twice or thrice.I would recommend to watch it again may be you will rate more that's what happen to you will see leo in Leo's perspective than parthiban bcoz now you know who the leo is and he hasn't done any good to be told in past ,he will do anything for cover up that story,leo is really really bad guy who's lying to his family for 20 years.",
    "40": "Let me start with the fact that I went to watch Leo not once but three times in three consecutive days!First watch was extremly delightful due to Razor-sharp screenplay and racy action sequences! Second watch was due to find some hidden clue that connect this movie with LCU & Guess what? It was like i am watching leo first time!!Third time watch took place in theater equipped with 7.1 Dolby surround sound system just to enjoy the great BGM & Songs composed by modern rockstar Anirudh!! Man, it was fire! Each BGM is well synchonised with scenes🔥🔥🔥My suggestion: Go & watch it in the theater with the latest sound system, it will be an extremly unforgetable experince! Avoid the negativity spread by so called reviewers!",
    "41": "I'm a die hard Vijay fan and his acting in Leo was tremendously awesome! So much of effort and power! Now coming to the story, instead of casting maya krishnan and napoleon character to link LCU it would have been more intense if a bigger cast did the roles. For instance, Arjun dass or someone else. It's Vijay's movie!!!! And just them who linked LCU and the scene. 100 people going against one man is very backdated. KH voice at the end to link LCU looked like the director had to put it at the end because he doesn't want to disappoint his fans. I understand it's not easy to direct a movie and I'm not in a position to say more but this is just an opinion. Overall movie was good and my 10 starts solely for my thalapathy.",
    "42": "It was average at its best movie, which didn't live up to my expectations even after going without any expectations. I didn't see any good goosebumps scenes, and there was no Vijay magic. The plot was predictable, and each scene pointed to a sequel, but the current movie didn't have much content. I think the movie needed more story, better scenes and a stronger plot to be more impactful.Many of the serious scenes fell funny and didn't work, and the full plot revolved around a single question that was asked from 20th minutes into the movie. The music wasn't as good as Anirudh's previous work, and the fight scenes and car chases were too long and felt like video game scenes.Overall, this was an average movie that didn't bring the wow factor or make me want to walk out of the theater with that great heroic feel in my heart. Even the crazy fans who watched the first day first show didn't have anything to say after the movie ended.",
    "43": "Loved this movie. Finally a good repeat watch for a Vijay movie. A movie that finally shows a full length performer in him instead of all those masala style of acting. Lokesh kanagaraj is another master film maker. Engages in every scene and that includes fight scenes as well. Gonna watch it again. Songs placement was very good. BGM was a very big plus in the engagement factor, not surprised with Anirudh here. He's on a roll. Villains- no matter what they say, villains are a big plus here.. started with sandy n myskkin as the psycho serial killers. Then Anthony das who have a soft spot for his son and Harold das who can't be won on a full fledged one on one fight. Well played. Loved it.",
    "44": "Great action, popcorn 🍿 movie. Inspired by the graphic novel \"A History of Violence.\" The movie became a huge blockbuster, earning over Rs 600 crore worldwide. The movie got mixed reviews from critics, but has been praised for Vijay's performance, action sequences, and music by Anirudh Ravichander. Soundtrack for the movie is on Spotify, and sounds great on speakers. Leo is one of the best action movies I've seen in 2023 and a must-watch for all Vijay fans, as well as John Wick fans. It left me guessing until the end as to who the main character really was, as he kept denying that he was Leo. I really hope they make a sequel as the ending left it open for more movies based on this character.",
    "45": "When the film flexes its muscles, it can be damn intense, stylish and even thrilling. The action is brutal and if you're into this sort of thing, you'll be really entertained. But the dramaturgical framework is once again really shaky.Leo is a great paranoid thriller that is bogged down by hollow supporting characters.Lokesh and Vijay's Leo is a lot 'bloody' than 'sweet'. Leo's roar may not be at its peak here, but, hey! It is still a Lion.Is Leo peak-Lokesh? No. But it's worth watching for Vijay's performance and its set-pieces.A formulaic but satisfying Indian remake of \"A History of Violence.\"",
    "46": "1. Movie has no clear message of what he wants to say or show\n2. Many loopholes in the movie right from the start to end\n3. Child raping is not a scene that was required and had no merits to movie story, being a responsible movie maker he must have avoided\n4. Background music was not in sync with the movie, music heard outside movie is fabulous.6. Vijay as usual is given his 200% to movie and has trusted his director to make best use of his talent.7. Vijay must be more careful with scripts heard versus movie made.8. Vijay and Atlee combination is missed in the recent past\n9. Please do not invest your time on such crap movies.",
    "47": "I watched this recently on Netflix. I think this is one the most violent films of Indian cinema and what Loki did with this movie was actually quite commendable. Talal that Vijay as Leo was raw, cunning, and deadly. The pace of the movie was well done and the scale this was graded on was done right. The movie hits the right cords and almost everything. The action was choreographed so sleek that you could not tell if there is a stunt double or not. Talking about the story, the story was good but I think it lacked a bit of seniority at parts. The issue I had with this was that he tells everyone that he isn't Leo but one guy in the movie looks at a picture of Leo and says he isn't Leo and he can tell by the eyes. That's a plot hole right there which didn't digest really well with me. Other than that, if you are a fan of movies like John Wick, your going to have the time of your life watching this.",
    "48": "Lokesh Kanagaraj's leo is a Full meals for thalapthy fans but better to be avoid some logic mistakes. Unwanted flashback are the biggest curse for tamil cinema. If they cut and through out the flash back sequence there is no lagging in the film b'coz after the flash back there is a silence between the theatre. And hats of to CBFC theirs editing is awesome and it does more work's than philomin Raj especially 'naan ready' song. Thalapthy Vijay's acting is appreciable he's done his great job Sanjay Dutt and Arjun both acted well but their characters could have given a bit more importance. Trisha's performance was amazing and as usual Anirudh blasts the theatre cinematography and CGI work's are awesome totally good work But I couldn't fully enjoy or celebrate this movie.But i have one question in my head\nWhy Anurag Kashyap...why\nI don't know.",
    "49": "Well if you are someone who is already a fan of the Lokiverse then you will surely enjoy this new entry after kaithi and vikram.While if you are new to this, you still are going to enjoy this movie regardless of its connections to the lokiverse, but knowing the connection makes the journey all the more enjoyable.The BGM of the movie is one of the strongest aspects, along with cinematography and well choreographed action. First is much more enjoyable the 2nd,\nThe ending Music Outro is one of the most epic i have ever come across in Indian movies, it was absolutely a blast , a BADASS song hehe.",
    "50": "Best entertainment, me and friends most enjoyed Thalapathy acting 💯 🔥, Ani music awesome, recently most favourite film of mine,best screen played, thalapathy dance especially Karu karu karuppayi,and na ready than varava best dance and music 🎶\nOpening hyena scene very well 👌\nOpening Thalapathy Vijay title card 😎 👌\nThirisha and Vijay 😍\nI didn't expect Madonna Sebastian gameo well done she's dance especially Na varava 👌\nAction king Arjun performed like devil\nSanjay dad sir acting amazing 👏\nGowtham menan police officer performance most enjoyed Thalapathy and Thirisha kashmir position most enjoyed 😉Thank you🙏 Lokesh Anna and enteire team 💯👌",
    "51": "Okay I just want to say something real quick. If you look at my account, you can see that I gave Varisu a 10/10. The reason for that was because I was fresh out of the theater and I was on a high. So my actual review for that movie would be a 7/10. Okay now let's talk about Leo. I can confidently say that this is so much better than master. The story has some logic, even thought it is outdated. The acting is perfect, everyone did their role neat and clean, especially Thalapathy vijay. Aniruth has done his job again. Lokesh kanagoraj has proved that he is the boss of kollywood. I can understand that is not for everyone but for Vijay fans and some general audience it's amazing. It's also a good addition to the LCU. Adds a lot of mystery to it and adds more hype to it. If you like it please go watch it. If you didn't that's fine. But personally, this is the best Vijay movie in a long time.",
    "52": "This is a good action, popcorn flick. Overall everyone agrees it's main lead characters play great role, but the reference to villains role being below par is an understatement. I believe both Sanjay dutt and Arjun role is justified because it's coming from dad trying to catch up with his son for patching up wrong deed he did and he wants his son back but his ego doesn't let him accept his guilt. All he wants to know if VIJAY is truly LEO or not...This about this angle and anyone who watch the movie might not pick on villains role a weak link. Overall it's a great all around acting performance by everyone.",
    "53": "The entire movie was a visual feast and bore the stamp of a Lokesh Kanagaraj film. Lokesh's obsession with creating a connection between characters in his \"LCU\" is a bit hard to digest. But as a standalone film, Leo is a well made film and Vijay has delivered a nuanced performance. There are no unwanted punch dialogues and the film moves at a steady pace. I personally felt that the director could have avoided the \"human sacrifice\" element in his story. Also, the fight sequences in the factory godown towards the end seemed unnecessarily long and unrealistic (maybe the director shot the film with possible video game franchise in mind is sonething only Time will reveal)",
    "54": "In \"LEO,\" starring Vijay Thalapathy, the fight scenes elevate the action genre to a whole new level. The creativity displayed in using everyday objects as weapons, from coffee kettles to tissue holders, showcases a realism and ingenuity rarely seen in Indian cinema. The film sets itself apart by steering away from the typical loud and intense sequences found in movies like \"Pathan\" or \"Jawan.\" In \"LEO,\" it's not about the volume of shouts but the strategic use of unconventional items, making each fight a thrilling and unique experience. Vijay Thalapathy's performance coupled with these inventive action sequences truly propels \"LEO\" into a league of its own, setting a benchmark for future films in the genre.",
    "55": "A film like this will be the first time in Lokesh's career! Lokesh said that there is something big happening in the first 10 minutes which I felt was the most hated 10 minutes. There is a Malayalam film released in 2016 called Pulimurukan in which the association between Puli and the hero seems more original than this. Vijay's acting is same in all movies. Story and character without a logic! Das brothers have done their role very well. Babu Antony and Mathew from Malayalam had less roles. Better than releasing a movie like this, it is copied from somewhere, we can find it on YouTube. Rs. 190 ticket savings!",
    "56": "This movie is so bad compared to Vikram. Vikram had set the standard so high and Leo is just so low. The actions scenes look so fake and VFX of hyena and the eagle was too bad. Movie hardly has any story. First half the movie is about how Vijay saves his family from some petty goons and second half is nothing but villians who wants to prove Vijay is Leo. So many fights occurs because the villians want to Vijay to confess he is Leo. The fights especially the car chase scene looks so fake. The fight in the end is dragged for more than 20 mins. The scene where villian gets trapped and hyena killing last guy is comedic. The fight in begining with hyena is also bad.Only Few actions scenes were good. Vijay acted well in some emotional and climax scene. Trisha doesnt have much screen presence. The english songs for action scenes doesnt fit at all. Can't belive this movie was also directed by Lokesh.",
    "57": "The movie was fabulous . A really great movie from actor Vijay after quite a long time. I don't want to spoil anything but right from the title card everything was straight up fire . The performance of Vijay has to be highly appreciated , especially in a scene in a police station and the direction of Lokesh Kanagaraj was brilliant .There are a lot of surprises in the movie for the audience . The VFX work in the movie is also excellent . Especially in the hyena fight scene in the beginning . Hundred percent paisa vasool movie . Both Sanjay Dutt and Arjun have done a very good job including Thisha and Mathew (Vijay's son in the movie) .A massive treat for the fans!!!",
    "58": "I certainly will say if you are a fan of Vijay you will definately love the movie, actually movie has no logical story conclusion. In some case if you want to watch a thriller and action packed movie definetly this is the movie you must pick. A good one time watch movie with an unexpected plot twist, fun to watch in theatre. One good thing about this movie is that it doesnot gets away with its track like the other LCU movie such as Kaithi, apart from which this movie grips the audience with a good presentation of its storyline which actually is not that much great as it was expected from the promos. Apart from that a good entertaining movie for the weekend.",
    "59": "Wow , what a movie! I am waiting to watch 2nd, 3rd time also in theaters. You will not be bored. Extraordinary acting by Actor Vijay. Music is different and too good. All English songs and the acting by Thalapathy was just perfect! Coffee shop fight was extraordinary. Hyena sequences and CGI was perfect. Lots of surprises are there which were not shown in trailer. Family audiences can watch the movie in India since bad words are muted. Other countries 13+ will definately enjoy watching the movie in theaters. I went with teen kids, they all enjoyed the movie. Block Buster for sure !! Leo Leo Leo !!",
    "60": "Thalapathy Vijay delivers one of his finest performances in this film, showcasing a remarkable transformation and elevating his action sequences to new heights. His dedication to the role is evident throughout. The entire ensemble cast, including the action king Arjun and Sanjay Dutt, gives their best. Anirudh's background music is electrifying, perfectly complementing the on-screen action. Director Lokesh Kanagaraj maintains his reputation for crafting outstanding scripts, and this movie seamlessly connects to his previous works. It's a part of the Lokesh Cinematic Universe (LCU). Watching this film in theaters is a must. With a worldwide box office collection of over 148 crores already, it's poised to enter the 1000+ crore club. In summary, 'Thalapathy Vijay: The Leo' is a must-watch cinematic experience. I won't reveal more; go watch it in the theater!",
    "61": "One of the career best film for director Lokesh and as well as Thalapathy Vijay na, Action sequence are mindblowing, Vijay's performed will be the talk of K. Town. Trish and Vijay combo after 20 years looks cool and romantic eventhough after 2 decades, sureshot 1000cr+ box office, Ani's music is fantabulous, Sanjay dutt and Arjun's villainism is on peak, kudos to the cinematographer manoj paramamsah and editor nirmal for their extordinary work, Wait and watch that the movie comes under LCU or not, Producer efforts to be appreciated for shooting in kashmir for nearly 50 days in that snow climate.",
    "62": "The film starts off really well with exploring the character Parthiban and his family members. The first 80 mins of the film is excellent which has proper dialogues, action sequences and screenplay. The rest of the is good but not upto the mark as it fails to keep the momentum going, it also lacks in detailing when it comes to the flashback portion as the director spent more time writing action scenes rather than focusing on the antagonist which make us feel that story very predictable. The character Leo Das is looking good and promising but yet fails to show the importance of the character.Even though the antagonist's motive and thoughts aren't clear, the film keeps us entertained with few good elements and scenes. Other side characters such as parthiban's son, Napoleon, Sandy, Mysskin and Satya are better written than the antagonist.. few more positives in the film. One is the acting done by Vijay which is promising and good and one of his best, the other one is the CGI and action scenes which are tremendously good and elevates the film.The LCU connect works with Napoleon the character from kaithi but the rest is still doubtful.The film had a potential to be the best film but it loses it gradually.",
    "63": "Wonderful movie in the direction of Lokesh Kanagaraj sir.Blockbuster reveal for the hero and best graphics. Superb transitions between the scenes and the connection between the LCU and LEO is an unexpected connection and the climax makes the movie better while the story of the past naration in between the movie is awesome.Vijay has put all his efforts for the movie and the action of vijay sir matches with the actions of the previous heros worked in the LCU. The same attitude and the same style.Coming to Trisha mam, She has made a wonderful part of the movie.i hope no heroine can match the standards for that character for vijay sir and the lokesh sir's selection for cast is wonderful. Awesome perfomance by whole team.",
    "64": "We could witness performer Vijay in this film, he provided very good performances on both characters. One thing I must tell, Lokesh always used to say one thing in his previous interviews like I am not good in writing romantic sequences, but in this film he written such a wonderful romance sequences and one of best romance sequences in Vijay movies. Both Vijay and Trisha were nailed it. Sanjay and Arjun characterise could have been better. Not much on their scope. Lokesh's excellent film making even though it's not a best movie among his movies. But Vijay's best movie in his recent times.And Finally Lokesh provides LCU connectOverall great to watch :)",
    "65": "It's not a movie. It's fully goosebumps. Lokesh has done a marvellous job creating a masterpiece. Thanks to him for giving this wonderful movie. The great vfx, cgi, Cinematography, every single thing made the movie a humongous blockbuster. Finally our dear Thalapathy Vijay, no words to describe his acting, never seen such a brutal and impactful role in any movies. This is one of the finest movies ever made in his career. Not only vijay fans, every single person will hopefully enjoy the movie for sure. A big salute to the cast and entire crew for their consistent support and dedication given throughout the movie. You'll enjoy the movie definitely. Repeat watchable movie.",

The e movie is filled with all the typical south indian masala, songs, dances and melodrama toped with stylized action sequences.It appears that the indians have run out of ideas. If the are in the business making remakes they should do so announcingly, otherwise it should be considered nothing less than intellectual dishonesty. What a shame for an industry who claims to be the largest in the world.There is a long list of plagriased movies in indian Cinema, from Sholay to Gajni and from Munna Bhai MBBS to Leo.",
    "67": "This is the super movie of Thalapathy Vijay starrer. The co-actors have done very well and added to the quality of the film. You will see Vijay's amazing performance in this film. This film can be said to be an action-type Tamil John Wick. The Loki screenplay is super duper. Rockstar Anirudh Music was awesome as usual Mass BGM Loki direction Indian cinema was amazing give you a perfect treat. This film is an LCU film and Trisha's acting was very good.lcu connection I really liked Loki cinema's pearl soon we will see Kamal Surya Karthi and Thalapathy Vijay on the same screen. Best wishes Leo team for chasing 1000 crore collection.",
    "68": "This film was 100% Lokesh Kanagaraj film. I really enjoyed this movie. Thalapathy Vijay's performance is very good. I have never seen such a performance in any film. Most importantly the action sequences keep me mesmerized. The fight scenes of this film are almost worthy of a Hollywood film. To understand how much the team behind it has developed for this film. Even the minor characters in this film are given a very good role. The climax of this film was unexpected. Most importantly, we talked about the songs of this film here. Every song is very nice.

First half and second half has some differences but also the movie is fully satisfied for me .I am really not except on this movie this movie awesome action stunts . My review to not disengage this flim. Hands of to star cast who works in this film Thalapathy Vijay , Trisha Krishnan, Sanjay Dutt , Action king Arjun etc.. this different slot of story making from Loki and more are less screenplay and cinematography tamil cinema industry is going to ahead nowadays of this like directors leo will create new records on box office note my words and story sequence will continue to next I am waiting for leo 2 .",
    "75": "I recently had the pleasure of watching 'Leo,' directed by Lokesh, and I must say it was one of the best cinematic experiences I've ever had. The entire cast delivered exceptional performances, and the action sequences were mind-blowing. Anirudh's background music added an extra layer of excitement to the movie. The theatre experience was truly amazing, and I couldn't have asked for a better way to enjoy this outstanding film. In conclusion, 'Leo' is a cinematic gem that captivated my senses from start to finish. Lokesh's direction, the stellar cast, breathtaking action, and Anirudh's outstanding BGM combined to create an unforgettable theatre experience. It's a movie that will leave a lasting impression and is undoubtedly a must-watch for any cinephile. Go watch in theatres any thank me later.",
    "76": "Extraordinary 1st half... Good but not great 2nd half. Even though the 2nd half was really good, the writing seemed to be a bit rushed in that area, and the villains were not as strong as expected to be, their characters had much more immense potential. The first half was near perfect. Amazing set up for the 2nd half, a perfectly well flowing story that set up the story extremely well. Honestly one of the best 1st halves I've ever seen. If 2nd half kept up to the flow of the first half, this movie could have been a masterpiece. Although, overall still an amazing film, solid 8/10. Great music, great direction, one of Vijay's best performances and script selections, great action and entertainment.",
    "77": "Yet another feather in his hat ..... effortless..... confident he walks around in all his glory!! With the right people to put together a brilliant performance.. Leo was no less than a thrilling winner!!! Vijay gives you the most organic feel of his character. - the wrath of a man who is wounded and had chosen peace over rebellion... but won't stop at anything when his own is in harms way.... the film was 2.45 hours too short .. cause it sounded like the makers had more to say ..... the much anticipated movie delivers with a bang for people to remember... Lokesh has indeed tailored this one and thus has thalapathy written all over ... which is a treat!!",
    "78": "Great movie experience in Imax, thalapathy nailed it with his new acting style. Loki connection in LCU was superb. Cinematography was amazing, storyline was on point. It was as good as Vikram. Lokesh has mentioned that the movie may remind of other 1k movies but requested to enjoy his style of direction, so went with an open mind & I was mind blown. All characters was good & I feel the flashback did not give a great impact for Antony dass, whereas Harold dass impact was good. Transformation of Vijay in the movie was goosebumps, the suspense & the sense of acting did not hint parthiban was leo.",
    "79": "It's funny how people jump into logic in commercial action movies. I loved the first part and thought the second part was good as well. Vijay single-handedly carried the entire story, even great actors like Kamal Hassan needed support from stars like Surya and Fahad, and Rajnikanth needed Mohanlal and Shivanna.The shots, first-person camera views, close-ups of Sanjay Dutt, the song Naa Ready, and fights like the intense market scene truly delighted me. The last 15 minutes of the first half left me feeling euphoric. The natural on-screen chemistry between Vijay and Trisha, as well as the gripping 6-minute single-take scene, really showcased Vijay as a top-notch performer.I felt the movie served to introduce Leo Das' character and demonstrate what he was capable of, which seems to have been Loki's intention.I heard many people say the introduction of LCU felt forced, but I thought it flowed quite naturally.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie from beginning to end, even if the car VFX was just okay - it was one of the most entertaining mass movies I've seen in a while.",

I am not sure why lokesh forcefully tried to include this movie into LCU without any proper subject, he wants Vijay to be there in his LCU but did not work just like Dilli or Vikram.

Its not just making a film in fewer days but also need some impact which was not seen in the whole movie.Worst movie.

And sanjay dutt's chatacter is very dangerous and arjun sarja's character is mind blowing. And sandy master's look was very different or made and it may be a big villain of the tamil industry.

    "84": "Bollywood has Shahrukh Khan, Telugu has Prabhas, Tamil has Joseph Vijay. I watched several of Vijay's films and was always amazed by his unique style of action in each film. The Tamil film industry has risen to a very high level in recent times. The story, character design, plot and climax of Leo's film are very satisfying. Starting with the story of a man named Parthiban who owns a popular cafe, managed with his wife and 2 children. Suddenly a group of robbers armed with sharp weapons came. Wanting to kill his daughter, Parthiban reflexively grabbed the gun and killed all the robbers. The big problem came after that. An old man comes claiming to be Parthiban's father, and says that he is Leo, his son who was thought to have died 20 years ago. Does Parthiban's past include Leo, who was the son of the owner of the Das & Co tobacco factory? Honestly, in my opinion, the story of Leo's film is better than Jawan's film. The only small drawback is that the CGI feels less smooth. Otherwise, this film is perfect. Worth watching.",
    "85": "Leo, is a fantastic action drama film of the decade! Thalapathy Vijay's Best Performance over the decade! Screenplay well represented, Songs n BGM of this film is the main pillar to do magical stuffs! Scene by Scene kills every moment! #LCU is the main twist of this film! More twist n turns are also include in First n Second half of the film! The best action film in India so far! Every actors well performed their characters! This film well suits for IMAX views! Performer Thalapathy Vijay's Career Best Film yet to date! LEO finally end with a suspense story! Leo 2 will give a ans to the haters! In a word it's a Bloody Sweet 🍫!",
    "86": "The major story was inspired from \"History of Violence\", LEO unfolds as a movie rich in surprises and intense fight sequences. The first half takes a slow and steady approach, delving into heartwarming family moments and introducing the formidable DAS & the Co gang with a badass soundtrack. The second half kicks off strong with LEO DAS's flashbacks and a memorable cameo by Madonna Sebastian. The stage is set for a gripping climax as the mystery unfolds: Is he Parthiban or Leo Das? The film concludes with a satisfying twist.This cinematic experience offers a captivating first half, showcasing Thalapathy in a distinct screen presence. The second half, while decent, has moments of drag and follows director Lokesh's familiar template. Despite this, it delivers a good twist to the story, though there's room for improvement. Overall, it's a delightful treat for all audiences and Thalapathy fans alike.",
    "87": "Apart from action it is a very engaging and well written, directed and cinematography is great as well. Especially the transitions of Vijay are also a spectacle to behold. Being a great mass masala movie in contrast Leo also natural storyline connections to the previous movies of director lokesh which are set in the same universe and are well connected. Movie doesn't waste any moments for unnecessary drama or forced humour, rather presents audience with great instances for humour. In all its a package movie set in the great lokesh cinematic universe and stands upto it's predecessors. Best Character Establishment of Leo in LCU . A must watch.",

Also flashback story didn't work well i wish that part could have come with better story. Ani could have given very stylish bgm like first half when car chasing scenes, its very loud couldn't even enjoy it. That's all botherd me otherwise all other scenes are excellent really enjoy it wish loki could showed rolex in this movie.Well done loki please from next movie don't present unlogic action squenses i know you were inspired by hollywood movies so please increase quality of fight sequnses. I really loved the caffe shop fight scenes with reto song got gosebumbs appreciate fights like real one with logic.",
    "89": "As an amid Vijay fan, for the past few years we haven't really had a solid Vijay film. BEAST being terrible, and VARISU having some good moments but being just bearable as a whole. Then came along LEO with an unreal amount of hype which after seeing the movie was clear that to live up to this unattainable hype was impossible.The film itself is brilliant, Vijay's acting and action sequences in the movie were top-notch. The VFX of the hyaena was decent, when it was running the CGI was a bit ... but all the close up shots were done perfectly. The only irritating part was the whole car chase CGI, which was really evident, for me anyway, the action performed itself was amazing, but the cars felt really animated and like a scene from a video game.Lokesh already mentioned at the start that this movie was inspired by 'A History of Violence' I personally decided not to watch that movie before watching LEO which is probably the best idea.I'm pretty sure by now everyone knows that this film is part of the 'LCU' which some reviews say was forced, which I did feel. Napoleon's entry (Police Officer from Kaithi) was great especially the theatre response. Then obviously there was the 'moaning girl' from Vikram, which she was kind of there for no reason really. Then of course, the phone call from VIKRAM himself at the end which was pretty good. So there is certainly going to be a sequel to LEO or LEO is definitely going to return.Overall, if you are a Vijay fan you will 100% enjoy this film, and its a definite theatre must-watch experience. The cafe fight scene was one of the best in the movie I'd say. There was a few cuts during the other fight scenes due to the film only having a '15' classification in the UK which was irritating because it affected the flow of the scene and kind of ruined the thrill and excitement.(P. S - This is my first time reviewing a film, so I've probably waffled a bit)",
    "90": "I recently watched \"Leo,\" and I must say it's a very good film. Talapathi Vijay's performance in his character is superb, and the remaining actors, especially Arjun, delivered strong performances. Director Lokesh KanakaRaj's unique style shines through, and the movie is a great addition to the LCU (Lokesh Cinematic Universe). The music by Anirudh Ravi Chandran, especially the \"Badass\" song, gave me goosebumps. The subtle cameo towards the end was a clever touch, and the references to Vikram and Kaithi added depth. The hyena sequence was excellent, and the VFX was impressively done.However, I didn't quite like Sanjay Dutt's character. Also, watching the Telugu version, I found the \"Naa Ready\" song didn't quite match up. Overall, I'd rate \"Leo\" 8/10.",
    "91": "When I saw this film first,i felt the first is superb and the second half is just an average. But when I saw the secret revealed in climax then I got an intrest to watch this film again. Then I understood this is the best film ever I experienced in a theatre. I watched this film thrice and the rewatchable quality of the film is extraordinary. Brilliant script, direction, characterisation, acting and other technical teams. Thalapathy Vijay's and master director Lokesh Kanagaraj's career best. Every one says this film doesn't have a powerful villain. But it has. I highly suggest this film. Because it is a must theatrical watch. Go and celebrate 🥂🎆💯😎",
    "92": "One of the strongest movie in Tamil industry. Don't miss the first 10 mins to level graphics. Well written story and tight screenplay. One more time director lokesh Kanagaraj proved his self. Lokesh breaks the all old format of tamil cinema. He brought the tamil cinema to another level. Starting to end proper screenplay. Vijay sir must be mentioned for his acting. What a performance. Every single scene he nailed it. Him-self feel proud doing it in his career..Dont dare to miss a single scene in this, all scenes are important part of this movie. A trendsetter in edge of the seat league movies.Must watch in theater for a great cinematic experience.#leo.",
    "93": "The central plot of the movie follows a somewhat traditional trajectory, reminiscent of numerous Indian films and works like \"A History of Violence,\" adapted from a graphic novel by John Wagner. Nonetheless, Director Lokesh, in collaboration with his writing team, skillfully injects a rejuvenating dose of suspense into the storyline with brilliantly executed plot twists. It's worth noting that the flashback segments seemed hurried and unconvincing, which affected the second half, and the pacing in the first half could have benefited from some tightening, especially the over-budget hyena sequence.To avoid revealing any spoilers, I'll conclude my thoughts here.Vijay delivers a commendable performance in both of his roles. While his appearance as Parthiban, a character in his mid-40s, may not be exceptional, it remains acceptable, and his acting is good. His portrayal of Leo, on the other hand, looks good but doesn't offer much to act on because of the short duration.Trisha didn't get a meaty role, but as always, she delivers a fantastic performance, radiating beauty even in a role that requires her to portray a woman in her 40s and a mother of a teenager. Her on-screen chemistry with Vijay is superb, a genuine treat for their fans.Sanjay Dutt's presence in the film is decent, though his acting doesn't quite match up to the overall cast's caliber. Arjun Sarja's role is actually useless, but his appearance and acting are good.The supporting cast delivers their best efforts, contributing to the film's overall quality. Priya Anand and Anurag Kashyap are underutilized.The action sequences are well-executed and visually appealing. The cinematography showcases moments of extraordinary brilliance, although it falls short in some areas. The songs may not be remarkable, but the background score is notably strong. The film's locations, sets, and costumes are adequately done, while the VFX work could have been more refined.Lokesh's direction deserves recognition for steering the film in a positive direction, but he should work on his writing.In summary, I recommend experiencing this movie in theaters to fully appreciate the cinematic journey it offers. #LCU.",
    "94": "On the bright side, we get..One of Vijay's finest performances (not as a star, but as an actor): The first half is replete with moments where Vijay showcases emotions as a doting father, husband, cafe owner, and animal lover.The writing in the first half: Superb, even when it's A History of Violence contextualized for Tamil sensibilities. Every scene carries a decent tempo, and the developments make you sit up. The whole hyena angle is beautifully executed, and its payoff in the climax is wonderful. The title card placement is a nice creative touch on Lokesh's part.Brilliant cinematography: Manoj Paramahamsa's frames wonderfully capture the Kashmiri locales (even though the film is \"set\" in Theog, Himachal Pradesh) with Parthipan's (Vijay) cafe looking remarkably aesthetic in that first fight sequence. When the film gets action-heavy, the use of the mocobot camera is put to fine effect.A pretty solid supporting cast: Whether it be Trisha (who looks absolutely dashing), Gautham Menon, Arjun Sarja, Sanjay Dutt, or Mathew Thomas, they deliver what the writing expects them to. It's just that the antagonists (Dutt, Sarja) lack sufficient fleshing out for us to care about their motives.Anirudh's music: While I feel he overdid the score a bit in the film, the elevation points (particularly a 10-15 minute pre-interval stretch) are fabulous, courtesy of his compositions. Badass Ma is the clear standout, but Naa Ready also worked thanks to the choreography. The English bits in the score were tremendous, and I can't wait to blast them on Spotify for my workouts once the OST is uploaded.On the not-so-bright side, we get..A lackluster second half: The whole flashback segment suffers from tepid writing. A key character is introduced only to be killed off just a few minutes later. The writing doesn't give us any time to register this character, let alone connect emotionally. This then becomes the driving force for the protagonist's subsequent actions. The whole \"identity crisis\" aspect also wears out, because there's only so much you can do with it. In totality, this is a 75% Lokesh, 25% Vijay film.Some tacky CGI: While this doesn't hamper the viewing experience overall, you'll come across not-so-great CG work in certain parts. This is especially the case in a car chase sequence.The LCU connect: Felt somewhat inorganic and forced. Given the film takes place geographically far away from the proceedings of the LCU, I felt it stood a better chance as a standalone piece. There are some interesting cameos yes, but nothing that gives you the wowness of Vikram, or even Kaithi for that matter. Lokesh definitely reserved his best for Aandavar.Middle-of-the-road aspect: Anbariv masters are quite well-known for their innovative set pieces. I loved the first set piece (at the cafe) - it felt raw and real, with fantastic cuts and zero slo-mo. There are plenty more in various locations, but only the climactic showdown (which also includes a 1v1 between Vijay and Arjun) lingers in my mind after leaving the cinema hall.P. S. - I enjoyed Loki's tribute to Sly Stallone. If you know, you know.",
    "95": "The original movie, \"A History of Violence\" had some purpose, character arc, but using that same story this one is so cheap version filled with overly stylized, glamorized, bombastic film filled with nonsensical plot points. I had a headache watching throughout of it.Every actor did overacting it's so hard to watch, from Vijay , Trisha, the son character, Psycho, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Sarja, everyone had no organic feel to the story. Even the family bonding is so paper thin, cheesy. The action scenes are forced inclusion so are the deliberate fusion of UNIVERSE kind of nonsense they are doing in here. There is no purpose to the leader character as that of the original film. Like more than saving his family members it's more like \"I NEED TO SHOW OFF\" of how amazing I'm fighter or what not nonsense.It's just terrible to watch. And it's a trend these days of over the top action following the likes of many Hollywood and even other trended PAN Indian religional films template following.",
    "96": "Leo didn't work out for me for reasons like below1. If villain is powerful , hero gets powerful and movie gets successful. This is totally missed here in Leo2. The reason for conflict between vijay and sanjay dutt could have been something else in the script but the reason in the movie was silly3. The whole movie could have been covered in first half to identify \"is he Leo\" and second half could have been made better with more engaging scene/script. The script was just very weak .Overall , it might work for audience who doesn't have any expectations who just want to watch a movie with family or friends .",
    "97": "Leo (2023) :\nMovie Review -Lokesh Kanagraj's exiting LCU (Lokesh Cinematic Universe) has a new update, \"Leo,\" starring Vijay, Trisha, and Sanjay Dutt in the lead roles. Kaithi was a fine watch, but the Tamil audience overhyped it, and then came a better one, Vikram. Since Tamil audiences have already overhyped Kaithi, they had no option but to overhype Vikram because it was a better film. Vikram's power-packed trio and Suriya's introduction gave them that chance; otherwise, the film has nothing extraordinary. Naturally, the hype around LCU went sky high, and then came the announcement of Leo. The Master Duo fought the pandemic despite mediocre content and won it. Leo didn't have to struggle at all. It had pre-release hype of the Master duo coming together in LCU, so things were easy. Maybe that's why Lokesh didn't work hard. Certainly not hard enough to deliver the expected content. Leo is easily the \"Lamest Cinematic Update\" (L. C. U.) we have in the Lokesh Cinematic Universe. Why did Lokesh have to copy a Hollywood movie (A History of Violence) to make such a hyped film after all?Since many of you have already seen A History of Violence (2005), you must be aware of the plot and also that there is nothing great about it. Parthiban (Vijay) is living with his wife, Satya (Trisha), and two children in Shimla. Professionally an animal rescuer, Parthi owns a cafe and earns his livelihood from it. In a fight with gangsters, he kills them to save his daughter, but that brings him more trouble. The gangsters he killed were very dangerous people, so obviously their people were coming for Parthi and his family. The same attack is linked to a big gangster, Antony (Sanjay Dutt). Antony sees Parthi's picture and recalls his dead son, Leo (Vijay), who was once his biggest strength. While Parthi denies being Leo, Antony and his gang members commit every dirty and violent trick to get Parthi to admit that he is Leo. Will Parthi be able to save his family?Leo is an ordinary script with a bad screenplay. It starts boring you from the first scene. That Hyena's attack scene will remind you of those outdated 80s films when a wild animal used to attack the village and a hero used to save them. The same happens here, but it takes longer than in the 1980s. They just forgot that it's 2023, and today's audience has come far ahead of such heroic stunts. Leo keeps adding more to your boredom with such scenes after every 15 minutes. From police's uncooperative behaviour, wife's suspicion, open market fights, attacks, villain's entry, backstory, and the same old identity crisis to the known trick at the end-Leo serves you with everything that other thousands of mass action films have fed you for decades. But why does it take so long? I was like, \"Bhai, khatam hi nahi ho Rahi yeh toh\". The problematic conflicts start annoying you after a while. The man had a court case for killing two people in a private place, but no police case or even arrest for riotous violence in a public place? To hell with whoever thought that we didn't know who Leo was. Bro, we all know he is Leo. The film wouldn't even start if he wasn't. You can't put your entire bet on such a weak segment. Grow up.Vijay doesn't really have those bulky physics, then I don't understand why he has to lose his shirt at the end. Is it a mandatory process, the way Salman does in Hindi movies? If so, then may God keep their fans happy with it. Let's forget \"cinema\" for a while. Vijay's star appeal is visible in Leo. He did well enough in those emotional scenes. It's the writing of the character that puts him down. Trisha has a typical wife's role and is so typical that I can't find anything more typical than to write 'typical' here. That kissing scene with Vijay was a pleasant surprise, though. Sanjay Dutt continues his substandard run with Leo. Baba, you need to work on dialogue delivery seriously. Don't let the prosthetics expose you like this. We want you back. Madonna Sebastian is too gorgeous to fit in the role of a female gangster, so it was definitely a bad choice. Arjun was scary enough, Priya Anand had nothing much to do, George Maryan didn't suit, and Gautham Vasudev Menon was decent. The other supporting cast was pass and go.Lokesh and Vijay's Master was popular for its music, but Leo has no match for it. Anirudh fails to create the Vaathi kind of magic again. The cinematography is average and too bad in the car chase sequences. Leo's VFX team made sure that I went back to my video game days from the late 90s. Those car chase scenes and explosions looked like three-decade-old Formula 1 video games. The production value may be rich, but the outcome is poor. One or two experimental top views by the director and cameraman did not make any difference. And where were those whistle-worthy dialogues? Did they forget to add them to the film, or did they forget to write them in the first place? Master has such intriguing conversions between Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi. Why didn't we get that in Leo? Lokesh Kanagraj's direction is clueless and below par. He is yet to master his classy work, Maanagaram, and it seems that he's not even trying. He's more interested in building a commercial universe that can pass through without quality. If that's the case, Leo is the perfect product that has no quality and is all mass. Let's say Mess! Lokesh needs to revisit Maanagaram again to revoke his forgotten talent, and then we can hope for better films in the future. A dip is fine, but Leo is beyond repair. Such a big drop in quality is worrisome for LCU. Better cure it before it's too late.RATING - 4/10*",

Absolutely unnecessary.Long Review:\nThe Intro and biting into the movie was good. Fight stunts were really good (Vijay did his part well). But chase scene in the mid of movie was awful to watch with over the top physics and Many of the fight scenes were really exaggerated like 1 vs 1000 people, really stupid.VFX on some scenes were really exceptional but in some other scenes (mid chase) were really awful to watch, looks like they rushed the post production here.Cinematography in overall movie was done really great(Loki Trademark) even though the VFX failed in certain portions.Story & Character building were absent in this movie which was the biggest disappointment that basically bored and killed the enthusiasm of the audience.There was only one thing to which the Movie was hanging on to until the end i.e. If Leo is in LCU( Lokesh Cinematic Universe) or not.

    "100": "Leo is Vijay's most hyped film of his career. Unfortunately this movie ended up as a mediocre. Vijay fans would enjoy this film but as someone who've watched Kaithi and Vikram. Leo is not even near those 2 films. This is definitely not a 100% Lokesh film, everyone expected it to be like Vikram, Kaithi but it was actually another Master. I felt like Master was better tbh.Lokesh wasted so many roles like Arjun, Sanjay Dutt, Anurag Kashyap, Mysskin. Their roles had no depth at all like any of his previous film characters like Santhanam, Amar, Anbu had so much depth.LCU looked forced and unnecessary for the film, this film had nothing to do with LCU since this movie had no reason to be in it.Flashback was just too short, it had no logic, and the emotional scenes didn't work tbh.I dont know why directors always do this to Vijay.When it was Beast we expected a movie like Doctor but he gave a disaster. When we expect something like Vikram , Lokesh gives us an Indian John Wick, WHY?No matter how many theories or explanation Lokesh gives, the mistakes in Leo can't be undone\nJust move on.Leo: 6/10.",
    "101": "Lokesh tried to fool audience with the hype of LCU. He tried to justify the expenses done on Hyena CG scenes. But I was unable to connect with that scene. Story or characters were not established yet. I was like what are you trying to do with this scene. If hyena was a metaphor of his character, then why movie name or his name is Leo? It could have been Hyena itself. Sandy, Mysskin and Vijay's cafe scenes were the best in the movie. It is the worst adaptation or remake of History of violence. Almost Parthi took the whole movie to reveal that he is indeed Leo, unfortunately entire audience know that he is only Leo, so there was no suspense or surprise in that revelation. They rushed to write the story and film it and release as promised. But they failed big time in the quality of the story and making. Human sacrifice was your best find to push Leo away from his family? Senseless writing. Could not feel Anirudh's presence in BGM. What was with Vijay's hairstyle?? Really!!?? The comment is not about him wearing a wig. With wig, you have more choice to come with better looks. May be they thought to bring Lion's hairstyle but terrible choice. There was no story to drag it for almost 3 hours. Lokesh needs to spend more time in writing. It doesn't matter that you take inspirations or copy from English movies. People always welcome quality movies. These type of movies should fail in box office for the betterment of tamil cinema. Otherwise more movies will come with hype and collect money just with the cast/crew names. Fans should not encourage these movies just because it's your favorite hero's movie. Support good movies and kick the rest away.",

This Movie experiments with a lot of things that we havent seen in the Tamil industry or maybe even bollywood.Although, I am not a vijay fan He delivered a really good performance,It wasnt his usual \"overly non sense Fight scenes\", This is prooof that a good director can utilize an actors full performance.Sanjay Dutt was good but not exceptional compared to what other actors of this cast reached.Trisha Also Did a great job.The CGI was questionable, it looked really good and refined in some places but most of the time it was not that great. It looked a bit unfinished in many places and also because of this many scenes were affected for me, Many Scenes were Downgraded with the use of artificial looking CGI. Although The Car sequence as we saw in the trailer was a bit artifical looking,When considering The industry standard It was pretty good.And Finally, The music. I gotta say when taking In Anirudhs past Works, This movie quite didnt reach there, i think the music was pretty overused (except one bgm)but the background score was good but i expected the music and bgms to be like Vikram but it didnt quite reach. I am not saying the music was bad but when taking in other Works of Anirudh,It was quite MidAltogether i would say its a pretty great movie, We expected a great movie And LOKESH DELIVERED IT HEAVILY.

The single shot fight sequence at the factory made me to leave my mouth wide open for its entirety! I admire Lokesh for the efforts he puts to push the boundaries of tamil cinema.Vijay really needs a round of applause for his performance and I really appreciate the fact that he agreed to do it in Lokesh's way. I never imagined that Vijay would pull of certain things as these are not something his typical film would have.Throughout the film you could see the hardwork of the crew be it the cinematography, editing or the CGI. And the result as expected is top notch. Anirudh's score has received a lot of mediocre reviews. Even though it's not upto the mark, I really liked the score made for Arjun and Sanjay Dutt. It's kind of underrated in my opinion.Having watched David Cronenberg's A History of Violence, I know the twists, turns and whatnot. Despite this, I thoroughly enjoyed Leo. Although I agree that the Das brothers were not intimidating enough and the flashback potion is written poorly, it is not something that would stop the film from being enjoyable.",

    "105": "Review of Leo by M. SirajVijay's best performance in a step back movie of Lokesh Kanagaraj.Mr. Lokesh Kanagaraj, who is the most wanted director in the Tamil Industry after the block buster of Vikram 2, much hype for his joint venture with Mr. Vijay is quite natural, Vijay gravely worked his level best to get out from the hitch of Beast.Lokesh leisurely starts to concise about Parthiban (Vijay), a café owner who lives in Himachal Pradesh with his wife and two children, Lokesh rebelliously avoids grand entry of Vijay as usual in his previous films with introduction song, he is accentuating an ordinary man's life. Once Vijay came in the lime light through media for saving people from Hyena attack as well as an incident in his coffee shop gets superfluous attention, the situation intensifies, some callous thugs notice him as gangster Leo Das, son of infamous warlord Sanjay Dutt. Parthiban (Vijay) antagonizes various skirmishes to protect his family, as the Sanjay Dutt and his brother Arjun believe sturdily Parthiban is Leo. The rest of the film merely rest on the subject that both Sanjay Dutt and Arjun are trying to prove Parthiban is Leo, is what forms the nub of the story.As a family man Vijay outshines as a father, a lovable husband. Hats off to Lokesh to bring out a never before emotional performance of Vijay, especially when he burst into tears to his wife Trisha, not to doubt him. The high-octane action sequences in the Car chase, the trademark of Lokesh beguiles the audience with fascinating camera effects and bgm.Anirudh's music is pleasing, especially in the dance for Vijay with thousands of dancers, Vijay's energy and dancing skill is second to none as well is action sequence in the cafe in the first half is hypnotizing. Anirudh presence is benchmarked with pulsating background score to accompany the explosive action sequence on screen. Leo is engaging because of Lokesh Kanagaraj's improvisations and the innovative methods he employs to recite the story.In spite of having a galaxy of stars through out in the film, Leo is a one-man show, Vijay is terrific in both characters, to keep audience guessing if he is really Parthiban or Leo, the shots were wonderfully shaped to audience to a certain extent. The absence of a power packed Villain in his earlier film Beast, this time he confronts with Sanjay Dutt and Arjun, both done their job remarkably, but the impact of Ajith and Arjun combination in Mangatha is definitely missing, definitely a setback for the audience who expected much.The film is solely depending upon the star value of Vijay, preparing the audience to be taken to an action-filled violent story, but Kanagaraj seems to made some compromise for the Hero image of Vijay, the anxious audience who had Vikram hang over in their mind, cannot not digest, as he fights with 100 goons alone, holding the neck of a Police officer at Police station amid other Policemen.Lokesh has to think new ideas, should give more importance to Story with resounding Screenplay, the novelty of using the same thing over and over again is archaic, for instance, cold blooded gangsters looking to enter the home of Vijay remind a sequence in \"Kaithi\" where the mobsters enter and take control of the police commissioner's office.In short, Leo is the first half that can claim 100% Lokesh making and the second half is only an average output. Other than character Vijay, the rest of the film give the audience only a soulless feel.Review of Leo by M. Siraj.",

You won't see The regular body language, mannerism.Lokesh's screenplay 🔥🔥🔥\nAnirush music 🔥🔥🔥\nAnbariv stunts 🔥🔥🔥\nNegatives:\nVillains could have been better written.So many known faces in the cast makes us expect more from them.Overall : A Loki, Vijay, Ani & Anbariv sambhavam! 🔥",
    "108": "Loki, Ani & Thalapathy rocked. It was the best treat to Thalapathy fans packed with electrifying action sequences, a gripping storyline, and Thalapathy's exceptional performance. As what Loki mentioned first 10 mins must not missed but for me this movie will keep all of us on the edge of the seat from start to finish. The movie takes us on a thrilling journey as Leo fights for justice, love, and redemption.The action sequences are nothing short of electrifying, with Thalapathy's impeccable stunts and intense fight scenes leaving us the audience in awe. Thalapathy's portrayal of Leo is undoubtedly one of his best performances to date.The choreography and special effects elevate the movie to a whole new level, making it a visual treat for action enthusiasts.Overall, Leo is a mass and electrifying movie that showcases Thalapathy at his best. With its gripping plot, breathtaking action sequences, and Thalapathy's stellar performance, it is a film that will leave all of us thoroughly entertained and wanting more. Whether you are a fan of Vijay or simply enjoy a well-crafted action-packed movie, Leo is a must-watch.",
    "109": "Vijay has been one of the few big stars who has consistently released movies even during COVID years. There is a certain pressure directing Vijay I and we could clearly see that in Lokesh earlier venture, Master with him. Master's probably is the weakest work of Lokesh Kanagaraj. I think most of us already knew that Leo would be a part of LCU (Lokesh Cinematic Universe for someone who didn't know) considering how Lokesh solidified the universe around Vikram. The trailer didn't reveal too much apart from a stellar star cast. Despite having many famous actors in the movie Leo is out and out Vijay film and yet it is not his usual Vijay film.Seeing the trailer and some other clips there has been parallels drawn to the movie \"History of Violence\". Kudos to Lokesh Kanagaraj for a deceiving trailer edit. I dont think Lokesh is trying to hide that he was inspired from the movie History of Violence, but I think he is just trying to pay an homage to it. That is the characteristic of Lokesh Kanagaraj just like how he has paid homage to multiple other movies in his previous films. The movie is set in Kashmir although shown in movie as Himachal Pradesh for the reasons we do not know revolves around a middle-aged man living a peaceful life with his family. Rest of the movie is about identity of the main character Parthiban played by Vijay and how he is fighting off the demons from the past or even if he actually has any. First half is crisp sets up sets up the character well and the incidents happening around the character makes sense. A lot of characters come and go and it feels kind of hard to track what is happening with respect to different characters. However, that does not deviate the movie from being entertaining. Second half of the movie with it's flashback story kind of turns out chaotic and not so reasonable at times. Leo has one of the best action sequences that I have seen in Indian movies in the recent times. The 2 fights in the first half are really well choreographed especially the action scene at the market. Anirudh slowly elevating background score does help the cause as well. Some people were not impressed with the car chase sequence in the second half, but I really liked it. Lokesh brings a unique viewer experience to that chase sequence it may not seem realistic, but still a treat to watch. The movie pretty much excels in all other technical departments. I think Lokesh finds it hard to balance the realistic and over the top nature of Vijay's character. He wants to show us Vijay as a vulnerable family man but also as a ruthless killer which may not resonate well all the times. The flashback episode isn't very convincing enough and does not have the emotional depth it is supposed to have. The choreography for the song \"Naa Ready\" is a marvel to watch and needs to be appreciated more. There is a LCU plug with the character from \"Kaithi\" but it is just for the hoots.Playing roles suitable to their ages seems to be the new trend for the South Indian actors and which it does look quite good in the salt and pepper avatar. Vijay definitely has worked really hard in the role and he runs the show despite the movie having such a heavy star cast. But there are scenes where I miss the quieter and \"mass\" avatar of Vijay which we scene in many movies. Trisha as his wife has played a very convincing role and she has underplayed it well. While his kids' roles add to the family element, I feel that they did not necessarily need their own arcs at times. Gautam Menon's role is apt but I would have liked some more exciting elements added to his role. Both Sanjay Dutt's and Arjun Sarja roles have been underdeveloped and their purpose seems tiring at times. Sanjay Dutt has repeated interactions with Vijay's character at times without really adding much to the film. I believe that could have been better served by adding more to their roles in the flashback.Lokesh Kanagaraj is definitely one of the genius filmmakers in the Indian cinema industry at the moment. Leo may not be his best work from a story and screenplay POV, but it is yet another great example of managing a big star's film with very few conventional elements to it.",

He said things without saying them. And if you are someone who loves movies, pays attention to details and know Lokesh, you will be excited with all the previously found weak points.",
    "112": "Making of this movie is wonderful. A classy movie with extremely good action and stunts. Vijay has excelled and performed to his best as an actor and an action hero. Those who question his acting skills just to degrade him, will not do so after watching this movie. I've seen a few reviews going after the movie to call the villains not too strong. Remember , Leo is the badass in this movie. Not always a villain has to be stronger than the hero or portrayed in a larger scale. If the Hero's character is based around being a badass then he's going to be the villain for the villains. It was so refreshing to see Vijay and Trisha together. All the scenes where they come together sparks chemistry and was a treat to the eyes. Trisha has a done a great job in the movie including GVM, Myskin, Sandy and all other characters.CGI work has been great in the scenes of Hyena, but could have been better in the car chase scenes, nevertheless Loki and team have given their best and it's visible to the viewers. Ani has once again been his rockstar version with the Bgm's and songs, and that's not a surprise anymore, as it has become his norm.Haters can nitpick on the movie. But for the audience this movie will be a treat and worth the watch. Watch it in theaters as that would give you the best experience and moviegoers would want to watch it once more in the theaters just like myself.By now everyone should know this is part of LCU. The LCU connect could disappoint some, but only Loki's next movies can explain how important was the LCU connect for this movie. I would say this is almost a stand alone film with couple of sequences to connect this movie to LCU.Overall this movie was a great experience for me, and I can't wait to watch it again in the theaters.",

The second half becomes a little more predictable and the final act becomes a little dramatic as well. The flashback of Das and his gang could have been more inventive and that is what I would call as the drawback of this film.Lokesh's making was really good as well as the technical department also did a good job and it was Anirudh's music that took the movie to the next level.Undoubtedly, it was Vijay who consistently steals the spotlight by giving one of the finest performance of his career, be it action scenes or emotional sequences.Overall Leo may not be as great as most people thought it would be, but with a stellar performance by Vijay along with a great 1st half, vere level interval block and a decent 2nd half, it satisfied me and delivered a great theatrical experience despite the minor flaws.",

However, upon watching several films, I must admit I was quite disappointed as they didn't align with my taste.I even viewed films featuring Joseph Vijay, and I couldn't comprehend why he was considered a star. However, this particular movie proved me wrong. All my doubts were dispelled, and it turned out to be an absolute delight.The key here is to avoid reading any reviews; the film unfolds with a unique suspense that is beautifully executed, leaving you intrigued throughout. While the action scenes might be a bit over-the-top (typical of South Indian cinema), they are well worth the experience.I highly recommend watching it - don't miss out.",

    "126": "Leo is good movie to watch.1st half the movie is outstanding specially hyena portion is outstand and the slow down on the 2nd half.....\nIn the first half, the movie fascinates with its style and grandeur, while the second half takes you on a rollercoaster of goosebumps-inducing moments. Lokesh Kanagaraj breaks away from his usual filmmaking conventions in this film, offering a narrative that demands the audience's active engagement in connecting the dots. The true intrigue lies in the movie's unpredictability - you'll be constantly surprised, never quite sure where it's heading to. Apart from Vijay, what truly propels the movie forward is Anirudh's exceptional background score and music. Anirudh, basking in the success of 'Jailer,' adds yet another powerful track, 'Badass,' to 'Leo.' The background score is a sheer delight, exciting the audience with its ability to maintain focus on the movie's style, even during intense or unsettling moments. With all that in mind, 'Leo' is a complete entertainer for those who appreciate grand spectacle and drama. However, for those seeking a logical or intricate story, 'Leo' may fall short of expectations, lacking a standout element in its storyline. But, when compared with Vijay's past films like 'Varisu' and 'Beast,' 'Leo' undoubtedly brings a breath of fresh air. It's important to acknowledge that the movie, like 'Leo', isn't without its flaws.",
    "127": "Okay! So lets start. Leo..... tbh one of the worst movie made under the direction of Lokesh kanagraj. The movie has no such impact and power to perform at the big stage or to create a massive hype for being a part of cinematic universe. Forget about grand slam like Vikram. This movie doesn't even compete with Kaithi. As a movie freak you can clearly see how this movie is totally dedicated to Vijay and his fans. Its not a people movie. Its just a way to make Vijay and his fan base happy. The story is dim the characters are killed in an early stage where Vikram or Kaithi doesn't set the same tone. Once you watch this movie as a critic you will clearly understand that its all about Hero and you can clearly see no dedication or respect for your compounded movies and characters. Now why am I criticising? Because this movie shouldn't have been a part of universe and it could have been much better as a stand alone film. Yes! This movie could have been better as a stand alone film. The characters had so much in them to carry themselves and dominate LCU in the future were all killed just to make Vijay strong and make his fans happy. Especially characters like Anthony, Harold and Sandy the psycho. They had so much potential in them. Disappointed with the stroy telling, utilisation of characters. After trying to imprint in people's heads how strong Leo is in LCU Leo couldn't fill that space. If you see Rolex with just 5 minutes of his work he defined art of acting and same goes to Anthony and Harold. Now the rumours are that Leo will be the biggest villain and the most strongest character of LCU sounds ridiculous. Rolex has already won that spot and should be in it.",
    "128": "Bloody sweet! I had so much fun with this. My jaw was literally dropped for most of it. It's a must-watch for action movie lovers with amazing fight choreography. Especially the cafe scene, the visually bonkers bike chase scene, and the final fight with Harold Das. I liked how it connected to Kaithi and Vikram and it did not feel forced at all to me. Not sure why a Christian believed in the occult and was making human sacrifices just to ensure good business. Weird. I have no issue with the flashback portion as some others seem to be having. I would have preferred if Elisa Das was given the same elevation as Leo Das since they both were supposed to be equals. Her murder and the subsequent building of a whole new (Hindu) identity on the opposite side of the country, settling down with a sweet family after being presumed dead is perfectly believable to me. It's weird that one of the protagonists of the LCU used to be a vicious drug peddler and a violent cold-blooded killer. The last confrontation between Harold Das and Parthiban is nothing short of great. Vijay is a bloody good actor. This is my new favorite from the LCU.So, in terms of how much I enjoyed it,\nLeo > Vikram > Kaithi.",

His character felt somewhat underwritten but Sanju baba's performance was nothing else than fantastic.Action scenes were really good and well executed!! Loved each and every action scene especially the VFX and CGI for the hyena was well done.The music and BGM by Anirudh sir is such a freaking damn banger!!!!

There is literally No Mass Intro scene , No Super hero stuffs and all. Just a guy trying to save his family, till the first half.Its one of the Best acting by Vijay in his career.Second Half is a bit laggy feel but its good.Some CGI work was very bad it looked like NFS Car Chase at some points.Final Fight sequence was over crowded with villans it doesn't do much good, But solo fight at last was awesome.Overall its a Good Movie and a must watch in Theatre.Don't go with the mindset of Vikram, its not as much good.

    "134": "This is going to be the most unbiased opinion of LEO. Firstly, I am a Vijay, Ajith, Rajini and Kamal fan. I celebrate all of them equally. Even Varisu VS Thunivu, I slightly liked Thunivu more than Varisu due to many factors that make it a better watch. Enough with introducing myself. As a critic, I lived through LEO.One of the biggest positives is the direction of Loki, how he turns a simple idea, to a blockbuster film without cringey mass scenes. Of course there are mass scenes in the film, but also includes class scenes as well making it clap worthy in the theatres.Vijay's acting, best acting so far, on par with Kaththi's Jeeva. I knew this film was inspired by HOV, so I watched it, and Vijay surprisingly did better than the person who played the character of Tom Stall.Trisha, chemistry was good, however not a fan of romance. The only boring scene in the movie was the family song which i took time to go toilet. However, the emotional liplock scene with Parthi and Sathya, mindblowingly amazing.....Sanjay Dutt did a good job as acting as the villain after KGF. I personally think he got a much better and grand role than KGF. Action king Arjun role was not as good though, it felt like he was acting as Antony Das Loyal Dog. The movie didn't need Arjun, and could of just not used him instead increase the promotions, which could of benefitted.Finally the Hyena sequence. After Parthiban charecter, Chubramani is my second favourite charecter especially in the twist. George Maryan did a really good job as well and liked his portions. Gautham Vasudev Menon was the Amar of the movie. Supporting cast did good, editing, vfx, music are all next level.LEO DAS, most massiest and classiest portion of the film was a spectacle. Twin part was unexpected though. LCU part for me was still a confusion, finding easter eggs throughout the movie was an experience that I will never forget.",
    "135": "StoryParthiban a baker in Kashmir is mistook to be a Gangster in Telangana called Leo by Leo's father Anthony and uncle Harold. How is Parthiban and his family life is affected by this confusion or is Parthiban really Leo.Is this part of LCU ? Do we see any LCU characters that's another question.What I liked ?Breaking shackles of Tamil mass hero cinema. I did not see build up openinh shot or punch dialogues.I loved how they showed Parthiban character as Vulnerable. Hero cries , Hero begs or pleads but you won't feel his stature go down that's very difficult to achieve\nAnirudh BGM especially in key portions like interval.Interval scene.Some elements in first half - Hyena capture, restaurant fight, interval portion etc\nWhat I disliked ?Forced LCU connect. None of LCU scenes looks organically connected. This is because story of Leo was conceived first and later LCU elements are added\nWastage of actors - Sanjay Dutt role was regular villain role, Anurag Kashyap was a joke, so was special appearance of an actress in second half (Won't reveal it) etc. Even Mysshkin looks wasted.Heavily inspired or copied from history of violence movie.Second half emotions fall flat. Scenes get dragged on unnecessarily.Simple wafer thin plot line and very predictable at the end.OverallI am disappointed. It is average movie not fitting well into LCU.Movie was flat emotions looked stale .First half was decent but second half is patience testing and dragging.Rating - 2.75/5Gross prediction- This will drop hope it makes enough money on first 4 days after that it is downhill.I am expecting- 130 cr first and first weekend to be around 300 cr and Overall to be around 400-450 cr .Remember it needs 480 cr to break even.",
    "136": "Leo was probably the most anticipated film in tamil industry , it satisfied all the VJ fans but didnt feed the LOKI fans rightly . As Leo cane after Vikram it was bound to be expected to outclass it in allways possible , but do kot expect another Vikram as you won't get it . The movie was a pure action packed entertainer and VJ just killed it , this is his best performance ever , you will see actor VJ rather than star VJ after a long time . But I was a bit disappointed on LOKI as to why he would have such a big cast and make them all so less impactful like Sanjay Dutt's character was said out to be the main villain but he rarely made an impact . The flashback was very short and the death of the sister made no impact at all . VJ and Trisha's family dynamic was amazing , loved every second of it. The first half of the movie felt realistic and enjoyable but the second half made me question a lot of things. But the car chase scene and the climax fight just made me watch the movie in awe , I bloody loved it. It is a scream generator though , made me scream my lungs off even though I'm not a VJ fan\nI will let you know VJ carried the movie completely , and that is a fact. Hopefully LOKI delivers something more an didferent in THALAIVAR 171 cuz I myself am a THALAIVAR fan 😅. Hey but you should , definitely watch the movie , it was worth all 215 Rs i spent.",
    "137": "After a man was attacked at home by a gang of petty criminals at the beginning, there is a hyena that has gotten lost in a snow-covered town and roams the city center like a giant monster, bloodthirsty and murdering, until finally the hero (with a ridiculous salt and pepper hairstyle, which was probably styled half an hour before each scene - it machtes the snowy landscape!!!!), puts it to sleep with a tranquilizer dart and then visits it with his family, which the hyena is really happy about and is suddenly very sweet and very tame.Afterwards there is a tame owl. The animals behave like they are from a Disney cartoon.The hero, who is is a very nice café owner and family man doesn´t only only tame wild animals, but also kills evil killers. Then he almost goes to prison because people don't believe him for killing the bad guys in self-defense.A conspiracy takes places as well and our man has to solve this too.Tthe soundtrack is truly horrible!",

    "139": "No spoilers\nManoj (Cinematographer)and lokesh(Directer)\nhad been an excellent combination in this movie as they have combined and given an outstanding theatrical experience to all the Movie lovers ,especially to Vijay Fans!The first half of the movie runs with an ordinary yet skillful personality in the town running his Chocolate factory and living a peaceful life.-The unexpected twist and turns with violence on his life keeps the audience thrilled and engaged.The Second half of the movie goes to the flashback story of the villain and his history for a day!Keep in mind that the story line of flashback which was narrated was something which happened just for a day. Practically there need not to be anymore Raw violance as most of the portions are covered in the first Half.-No unusual thrills and hype,as the movie had its biriyani in the first half.But it was a well directed and an decent second half to be honest.U cant expect it to be the same as first half and u cant expect more villanism with Harold and Antony Das,As LEO DAS is the prime show of the movie.Overall the movie is a complete entertainerComedy :- 2/5\nHypes :- 4/5\nFamily watchable :- 4/5\nFans feast :- 4/5\nFight sequence :- 4/5\nCinematography :- 4/5\nTheatrical Experience :- 4.5/5.Go watch it !",
    "140": "A pure theatre experience by Lokesh Kanagaraj.We can see Thalapathy Vijay as a PERFORMER. There are somany goosebump moments. One of the best action choreographed (High octane & brutal) movies in indian cinema. Cinematography was awesome. Theatre experience was greater than KAITHI & VIKRAM. Recommended for family audiance. Go watch enjoy !Performer wise Vijay is the show stealer and\nTrisha done well and the chemistry between both were excellent.Vijay as Parthi is best by him till date.Bgm and Music is Hollywood level. Hats off to Anirudh.It will be a sureshot industry hit by Loki and Thalapathy.",
    "141": "Leo is a 2023 Pan Indian movie directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, starring, Thalapathy Vijay, Trisha, Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Sarja, Gautham Vasudev Menon and others. Leo is out & out Loki's mass entertainer. It does have the elements expected from the makers, but thought few were left and were not considered much. As mentioned by the makers, its an adaptation of a Hollywood film named ' History of Violence'. The plot stands same, the run time of this movie's around 90 mins. The touch of loki and Vijay's massy characterisation made it to 2hr 40 mins.Coming to the story,\nParthiban is a wildlife enforcement officer and a family man who has the hold to control the family and the wildlife species. Parthi also runs a cafe which is the main crux of the story. The family lives happily until, the baddies arrive. It all starts, when Parthi gets into a wild brawl with the baddies in his cafe. Which later made him a hero. The other side, the Das team got to know about him& assumed parthi as leo. As parthi is a lookalike of leo. This leads to the start of main conflict.Is parthi leo? Is he really deceiving the das brothers? How is this a part of Lcu? To get these questions answered, you need to watch the movie. One thing that I liked the most are the posters launched by the team. They were super cool and depicts the character of the hero.The universe created by Loki stands one of the best moments in the film industries, the interlinking of the movie with other movies is a great step. Considering Leo a part of this cinematic universe, it gets all the expectations covered and highs up the audience's pulse. These references/ moments gives chills indeed. Kudos Loki. Contrast to it, I would also rate this movie as Loki's weakest work, there were just changes made in the story and the action sequences were added. It still lacks the crisp, Loki's obsession towards the robotic cameras needs to be changed or should lead to a creation of a new shooting technique. It felt, he was entirely dependent on these cameras. Again admiring him for using the imax lenses, which made the output of the film look like a brightened saga. This anamorphic lens literally blew the minds of the viewers and took the flick to another level . Also the locations shot, syncs with the lenses. DOP Manoj needs a huge amount of applause for his brilliant cinematography . Top notch screenplay by Ratna Kumar. Editing was actually perfect. VFX works in parts, however the hyena sequence didn't give a high impact.The film has a good amount of goosebumps and high levels of giving adrenaline rush. The fight sequences, esp, the cafe, car chase is enough to get your tickets booked and make you feel worth it.Coming to the negatives, Loki na focused more on the characterisation of the protagonist and let away the antagonists characterisation. It was dull and only gives the impact when Ani's bgm is added to it. Now the topic has turned to Anirudh, let me say more about him. He in his recent interview with 'film companion' said that Loki never sat for a music session with Ani and laid trust on him. This is the coherence needed between a director and a music director. Truly, Ani composed one of the best ost's and is enough for all the youngsters and the fans to set these bgms as their callertunes or ring tones. The Das bgm is still grooving in my mind and it wont go away easily.Verdict\nAs said by the team, the movie doesn't have cool intros with high sounding bgm and an intro song. Its definitely a good attempt by the team.Keeping the predictable twists and the run time aside, it would defintiely be an enjoyable ride and an action entertainer. The fights and the bgms will be the main reason for the people to watch the movie. For the general audience, it might be an ordinary commercial film. So,\nWatch it, if you're really involved in Lcu or you want to experience the new avatar of Thalapathy. You wont be disappointed.OverallKaithi>Vikram>Leo.",
    "142": "Am not going to give any spoilers. When it comes to Vijay there is too many negativity revolving him, proving that he is growing by all means. A round of applause to Lokesh for bringing the Actor in Vijay. If u want to see Vijay in a performance oriented movie then this film is for you. Some claimed the pace of the 2nd half is little slow, but there is a lot of reason for it if u think from Loki's point of view. LEO is an underdog. Watch the magic . Go normally and you will come out with smiles is all i would advice.LEO LEO LEOThere was a point where i even i started to scream and clap hands. Such was the performance from Vijay. Anirudh and Anbarivu excel again in this movie. They work hard. Anirudh has gone full metal for this movie. Looks like he got so impressed by the BGM of THOR: Love and Thunder. He has tried something like that and it worked big time.Tamil Cinema has gone to the next level. Whole of India is talking only about one thing LEO LEO LEO.LCU connect was awesome. When u take on someone like Rolex, then u need a badass like LEO for sure.Comparison is the biggest problem which Vijay haters should learn. Everybody's life is different. DIlli's life is different and he is a different personality. Vikram's life is different and he is a different personality. LEO's life is different and so is his personality. Dont compare the stories. Every movie and hero is different. Its like comparing Captain America, Iron man and Thor. They all have different perceptions and different approach to life, but they are all here to save the world. So is Dilli, Vikram And Leo. Different characters of life coming together for a social issue, Drugs. I still dont regret anything about the movie. 1 thing was flashback , the reason was so old school. Sacrifice and stuff was outdate. Could have been a stronger reason. Its a well made movie though it has its minor glitches.",
    "143": "Leo is Thalapathy Vijay's career best as a performer. He NAILS it & I absolutely loved his range. Loki interviews la promise panna maari, \"Idhu varikum paakadha oru Vijay anna va kaamika try panirken\". On this promise, he certainly delivered. Trisha-Vijay emotional portions laam superb.Ani kills it as usual, especially in the first half. The 'I'm Scared' track is an absolute screamer & Leo OST in general is something you're definitely gonna see me use a lot in my stories.VFX is insane & the entire Hyena portion is so well done. A huge step up for Tamil Cinema in terms of filmmaking. Subramani is surely gonna win a lot of hearts.The filmmaking & camerawork is incredible. Andha 2nd half la Das n Co factory la vara 'oru moving camera' sequence absolutely blew my mind. The movie is a proper theatrical experience.",
    "144": "DISCLAIMER: I had watched a 15+ version of the film, which I acknowledge has cut about 3 minutes of footage. I have taken this into consideration in my review for Leo.The film progresses at a brisk pace, not feeling overbearingly long which is a common problem with films that are around 3 hours or more. There are no sections in which the film lags. The 1st half has no major issues to comment about, and while the film takes some time to get going, it sustains the pace it finally achieves. However, the writing is rough in the 2nd half with a few doubts raised about some of the film's scenarios. This makes the film feel disjointed in retrospect.The character writing of the main character is good, resulting in a grey-shaded antihero, masterfully portrayed by Vijay. Despite the rest of the cast also giving good performances, the character writing undermines their performances resulting in them feeling quite flat. However, Trisha Krishnan (Sathya) and Mathew Thomas (Siddharth) have good chemistry with Vijay and convincingly connect as a family.The VFX was sub-standard for a film of this budget. The animals are rendered nicely despite having rough animation, and the cars are really poorly rendered and animated, taking me out of the immersion for a couple of sequences. However, the action sequences involving any CGI are not heavily impacted, thanks to Anbariv's (the stunt co-ordinators) masterful work for this film. These sequences manage to elevate the film effectively.The editing was choppy, although this may be attributed to watching the 15+ cut version of the film.The music by Anirudh manages to deliver effectively, and combined with the action sequences culminate to showcase Leo at its best. However, it is still inferior to his work on Master (2021), also a Lokesh Kanagaraj film, due to a couple of songs in this soundtrack falling flat.The direction is strong and confident, so while the film feels messy in the 2nd half, the direction definitely makes up for it.Overall rating: 8/10 (76%)",
    "145": "Positives:\nVijay showed off his beast,every character gave their careers best.Anirudh's bgm made the movie more interesting and movie contains so many bgm's that will blast the screens for every scene.Anirudh's music takes the movie to next level that makes audience off their seat.Good cinematography and VFX workNegatives:\nSome fight scenes take too much time than necessary.Story line is a bit unsatisfactory especially climax doesn't feel that much satisfactory compared to Vikram.Expected LCU connection more.Overall a watchable movie especially for Vijay and lokesh kanakaraj fans.",
    "146": "This is undoubtedly Vijay's best film in terms of acting and performance. The movie is inspired from history of Violence, and it doesn't have a dull moment if you watch it in the theater.The movie takes off in the first 10 minutes and there is no looking back after that, the interval was an absolute banger. It is definitely a one-of-a-kind movie for Vijay and indeed very experimental.Though this film will smoke all the box office records, you must watch it for the scintillating VFX of hyena and the action scenes.It was a very brave attempt by Vijay to get into the Director's world and become the character itself. There are a lot of Goosebumps moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It was a great experience overall and worth all the hype.LCU is getting bigger and bigger.",
    "147": "The story is badass and the every actor played\nThey were playing in reality evryone should watch this movie, the main actor Vijay thalapathy played an immersive role in this movie\nEvery part of his scene is an art\nGiving goosebumps\nThe villians are also played great actingThis movie is an thriller and suspense mixture\nI am giving 10 out of 10 rating because of story\nLine and best actingEven the bgm of anirudh is badass\nGiving proper sync to sceneEvery one of this played best experience for meFor me the best is the storyline, bgm and acting\nEvery one should watch this movie now in nearby cinema.Great work Leo... Team\nHats off.",
    "148": "Oh, Leo South's latest movie is an absolute rollercoaster of emotions! From the heart-wrenching opening scene to the unexpected plot twists, it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. Leo's performance is nothing short of mesmerizing-he effortlessly transitions between moments of intense drama and lighthearted humor.The cinematography is a visual feast, capturing both the grandeur of sweeping landscapes and the intimacy of intense close-ups. The director's artistic choices enhance the storytelling, creating a cinematic experience that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll.The supporting cast deserves a standing ovation too, each actor bringing depth and authenticity to their characters. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable, adding an extra layer of believability to the intricate narrative.What sets this movie apart is its ability to tackle profound themes without losing its entertainment value. It's a thought-provoking exploration of the human condition, wrapped in a package of stellar performances and breathtaking visuals. Leo South's movie is a must-watch, a cinematic masterpiece that resonates with both the heart and the mind."
