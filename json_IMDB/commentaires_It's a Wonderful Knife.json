    "0": "We saw this as our local theaters \"mystery movie\" where we get to watch a movie before it comes out for a discount, without knowing what movie we're going to see. It started out as a promising comedy/slasher spin on \"It's a Wonderful Life\", but as the movie went on it made less and less sense and went from slapstick funny to just dumb. Instead of just an alternative spin on the main characters life, the second half tried to incorporate supernatural elements to explain the ridiculous plot twists but they just didn't work and fell flat. Even at $5 watching this movie just wasn't worth it. I can watch better movies on streaming services at home.",
    "1": "\"It's a Wonderful Knife\" is one of the worst movies I have watched this year. I love slashers-I really love slashers, but this didn't do anything for me. It neither worked as a corny Christmas movie nor an entertaining thriller. It's badly acted as well, which may be on purpose, though. The storyline is intriguing, and it's an interesting hybrid slasher/cheesy Christmas movie idea-wise, but execution is downright terrible. It felt like they were making things up as they went along, and nothing at all connected to convert into a semblance of a cohesive movie. It was just a mess, and not an entertaining one at that.",
    "2": "It's a wonderful knife takes terrible gen-z comedy and makes it worse, utilizing it so much that it hurts. The kill scenes in this film were awful and corny. This story is as basic as it can be, with the wishing she was never born, which by the way, she never says she wishes, she just makes a statement saying people would be better off without her. There are so many plot holes in this film it hurts, so much in this film makes no sense, I can't even understand where they were going with it. I promise you this movie is not even worth watching. It makes no sense, it's too corny, the forced gen-z stuff is awful.",
    "3": "Not very well written, or well thought out. It seemed like they came up with a cool title and idea, then rushed it into production. The dialogue sounds like it came from a first draft and was very hard to take seriously.The slasher element isn't very interesting because you know who it is from the trailer/opening scene. The jokes aren't all that funny either. Which puts this movie in a very grey in-between of being oddly watchable, yet unbearable all at the same time.Felt like a straight to streaming movie yet I saw it in a theater so props to the studio for that I suppose. Haven't been a fan of these types of slashers though with Totally Killer and the like.",
    "4": "Loved Freaky and Happy Death Day! Not so much this...A good start but a terrible finish. It had its fun moments, but then it didn't.I'll start with the good.The acting. Justin Long does a great job with his character, making him a creepy, awesome bad guy. The main girl, Jane Widdop was an absolute joy to watch. A charismatic and lovely on screen presence. The rest of the cast did theirs.The horror. The kills and the angel bad guy were awesome. The direction and overall motive were also good and fun to watch.The atmosphere and scenes were nicely done.The mediocre.The It's a wonderful life aspect. Some parts were good, some not so good. I know it's a horror movie, but I didn't get much emotion from it.The bad.The direction and writing. This went from good, to completely losing itself, to the point it ruined the ending. There were things that happened that made absolutely zero sense, and then there were things that were messy that didn't need to be there at all.The ending. It was a waste of time. Justin Long's character faded out until the ending, where it was so anticlimactic and basic. I still can't believe they ended it like that.The love aspect. I'm all for a good love angle with whatever preference and whatnot, but this movie doesn't do kindly to straight people, and promotes cheating. It felt weird in a bad way, that it was forced into the script to make a point.",
    "5": "To the pantheon of unusual Christmas movies (Gremlins, The Ref, Krampus, Violent Night) we can now add Tyler MacIntyre's \"It's a Wonderful Knife\". As the title implies, the movie is a spin on \"It's a Wonderful Life\". In this case, a girl feels unwanted and wishes herself out of existence, only to see the horrors that result. There's some gore, but the movie focuses mainly on this girl and how she discovers her importance to the town.It's not any kind of great movie, but it makes no pretense about what it is. With some of the mushy holiday movies that get released - i.e., a dad ignores his family but ends up bonding with them over Christmas - it's fun to see these twisted ones. You'll enjoy it as long as you accept the completely improbable premise.Watch what they do with the closing credits.",
    "6": "This was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was easily one of the bottom 5. It was like a few High School Pot-Heads decided to write a Script turning a Christmas Classic into a Slasher Film. It was not even a Horror Film, because there was close to no suspense felt.I was fortunate that the film only cost me 50 cents with my Regal Unlimited App, but I still feel like I paid more than the experience was worth. This was definitely a movie that should have gone straight to some obscure Streaming service to watch while people are drunk at 3am. Hopefully it will be a forgetful experience that can merely pass time until they simply pass out.",
    "7": "I was fortunate enough to get to see this movie early and I enjoyed myself enough however, I caught myself checking the time at several moments and it started to drag. Justin Long is one of the most interesting actors working today as he picks the strangest roles I loves him in 2022s Barbarian, Jeepers Creepers, and Tusk and this movie is no different he is phenomenal in it and very enjoyable to watch and I would only recommend this movie if you are a fan of those previous works. However, he is not in it much and the lead actress is not very good. The story is almost nonexistent but that's okay for a movie like this. Joel McHale is also enjoyable in this movie but the ultimate product is lackluster if you're a fan of Christmas horror movies or Justin long it's worth checking out but other than that you won't be missing much if you skip this one.",
    "8": "Where do I begin...The number of plot threads which go nowhere, the ridiculous contrivances for the sake of the plot and an utter contempt for common sense. Nobody's motivations make any sense. None of the characters are likable or relatable. The motivation of the antagonist is completely nonexistent. This is one of the worst written movies I've seen in recent memory, such a disappointment with a relatively unique concept, but the execution of this was abysmal. I was onboard for supernatural and fantasy elements for the sake of the plot, it makes sense...but then they throw in more of it for absolutely no reason. Imagine watching the wizard of oz, then learning that Dorothy was a vampire all along, it doesn't have anything to do with the plot...it's just thrown into the plot with no explanation and everyone just moves on and has no questions. This is the sort of bad writing that you're in for with this travesty. Skip this one, you have been warned.",
    "9": "A film that made me glad I have regal unlimited, easy to hate and nice spin on It's a wonderful life (1955) crazy to think that's nearly 70 years old. Probably the strangest role for Justin Long that he changed his voice a bit which sounds so weird especially when he uses his regular voice and besides his role in Jeepers Creepers where his outcome is extremely morbid, you'd want him to die in It's a Wonderful Knife. The main girl is solid I enjoyed her character. The acting is the biggest flaw otherwise I liked the movie a fair amount and has some stylish kills; not as bad as The Mean Green that came out a year ago!",
    "10": "Very boring movie with a very horrible storyline. Not worth my time nor money. A lot of people left the theater mid movie. The story is very basic and a lot of situations were forced on the characters. The choices made are not reasonable. I would never recommend this movie for anyone. The storytelling was very horrible. And there was barely any scary scenes. Almost all the scenes did not make sense at all especially the stuff with the lights. Most of the time I questioned myself what is the message that is trying to be delivered here. What is the concept of family and what am I supposed to get out of it? It was so boring to the point. I started question what is the purpose of my life?",
    "11": "So fed up with this DIE (yes I meant DEI, but let's get the letters in the correct order, it's killing movies) I was put off, within the first 10 mins. I tried to like it. But at 57yrs, I think I'll stick with the likes of the original black Christmas, krampus etc. I love horrors, it's what I watch most of the time and have an extensive collection of physical media. Stop appealing to a tiny minority, give us movies we all can enjoy. I'm not bothered who's in a film, if the stories good. Eg US creepy as hell and Talk to me. But this ticks every box twice and then some. Please bring back good story telling. Us horror buffs need it. And it's what will bring us back to the cinemas.",
    "12": "I throughly hated this movie. I never review movies but this was so bad I feel like I need to make sure others don't spend money on this. The best way I can describe it is the bad acting of a hallmark movie mixed with a slasher with plot lines that don't make sense or are ever explained. I think if you want a bad movie this is for you but just don't spend money in the theaters for this it's really not worth it. The acting is honestly really painful at first it felt like a comercial and then it kept getting worse. The writing felt like it was written by a child genuinely it hurt, the whole time i was laughing at how horrible it was but never at written jokes. This movie hurt me.",
    "13": "Did the filmmakers not understand the most basic construct of the \"Scrooge Christmas\" formula? A BAD person should learn their life isn't so bad. That's not this case with this movie. The protagonist literally killed a mass killer and is treated badly by everyone, including her parents. She gets a tracksuit while her brother gets a F250 truck and the movie wants you to think she is the bad one for pointing out the inequality in gifts. Her parents do not care that her best friend was killed or that she is the hero, they only want to forget everything. She is a victim, not a villain. Why does she need to learn a lesson? That single thing ruined the entire movie for me. She is literally the only normal acting person, yet we as an audience, are expected to view her as a pest in need of intervention. It's as bad as it sounds with the protagonist being happy her boyfriend hooked up with one of her friends because \"you are perfect together\". Seriously? This ahole cheated on you for a year but you are willing to rollover on it because your 24-hour experience made you seem selfish? This is a bad movie with even worse messages. Do not waste your time.The point of the story should be a negative person being changed by kindness but that is not the case here. It's a story of a pushover being told being a pushover is good.",
    "14": "I was so hopeful for this movie and it falls flat in every aspect. Plot holes galore, horrible acting, the kills weren't inventive. I believe I could make a better movie than \"It's a Wonderful Knife\". Ultimately I regretted the time spent watching it, because it only gets worse as it goes on. Some parts made zero sense.It truly feels like they came up with a cool title and then just slapped something together. I'm normally a fan of Justin Long, burmt his character is so annoying that it made my brain hurt. There are no real redeeming qualities to this movie. The design of the killer's costume was pretty good, save for that it's a abomination of a film.",
    "15": "I saw It's a Wonderful Knife, starring Jane Widdop-Yellowjackets_tv, Deadly Daughter Switch; Jess McLeod-One of Us is Lying_tv, The Unforgivable; Joel McHale-Animal Control_tv, Stargirl_tv and Justin Long-Barbarian, the Jeepers Creepers movies.This is a slasher movie that's not too bad. It has some interesting twists. It takes place on Christmas Eve in a town called Angel Falls. Justin is the mayor of the town and is in the process of buying up houses so he can build shopping centers in their places. Joel is the realtor that is helping Justin. There is a serial killer that is killing teens and dresses like the angel on top of the Christmas tree-all in white, with no face. When Jane, Joel's daughter, is attacked by the killer, she kills him and discovers who he really is. But when Jane wishes she hasn't been born-she is having a bad day-suddenly, nobody recognizes her, including her own parents and friends. The killings are still going on and she has to find a way to stop the psychotic killer again-remember, she knows who he is-with no one to believe her. Jess is a fellow student that she enlists in her mission after convincing her that she is telling the truth.It's rated R for bloody violence, drug use and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",
    "16": "To me this is a jumbled mess that jumps between Christmas, Horror, Drama, and maybe Comedy? (I did not get or understand the humor). With other confusing elements. I do not recommend watching more than once if you watch it at all.If you decide to watch it I recommend seeing\nYes, Virginia There Is A Sants Clause (1991)\nIt's A Wonderful Life (1947)\nIt Happened One Christmas (1977)I am recommending seeing them because Katharine Isabelle played Virginia in Yes Virginis.... So, I think there is a deeper meaning with her casting. The other two is because it is a reimagining of It's A Wonderful Life (1947) and It Happened One Christmas (1977) as a teen horror movie. So, you will have a better understanding of this Weird Christmas Horror film.",
    "17": "If you are going in looking for a good time & a no brainer, dont bother.... the title is as good as it gets. 1. no inventive kills, super lazy .2. Boring, just boring & 3. These actors are just TERRIBLE, the lead broad couldn't act her way of paper bag (the Lifetime & SciFi actors run circles around these clowns) . Mystery Movie Monday is the only way anybody should pay for this. Justin Long is the only good thing a bout this movie ( think about that befor paying your money) & Joel McHale ( stick to guest spots on the masked singer) good lord\nYou seem like you could be funny & this film should have an easy fun horror flick but it is not. Its painful to sit threw .",
    "18": "As slasher movies go, this one has successfully added another memorable murderer to the mix. \"It's a Wonderful Knife\" featured a distinctly Christmas-themed - and ironically so - story in which to place a weird killer.The slasher wearing white seemed to evoke Xmas-snow or a biblical angel. Most probably that last, because of the winged hilt on the killer's knife, and his costume which seemed to be a carbon-copy of the angel ornament atop the town's Christmas tree.There was much to appreciate about the slasher's overall design - costume, props, movements, et al. The murderer had a 'wonderful' screen presence that I didn't think I would enjoy as much as I did. But, except for a few action-burst sequences, they barely showed him on screen.This white-robed character felt like an intentional redesign based on similar movie characters from the past, like the one from the \"Scream\" franchise. But that only made this killer even more memorable, not to forget some great physical acting. The man behind the hood and reflective faceplate certainly deserves appreciation for making this overly familiar character 'type' feel thrilling and fun.A great cast of characters further enriched the story and gave it some corny but nice 90s vibes. Special shout-out to Justin Long as Mayor Henry Waters. He has been captivating in several projects lately, and he didn't disappoint in this one either.The idea of pursuing greedy capitalism without pausing to appreciate history or cultural sentiments was a minor plot highlight. It was a tad Scrooge-y but the delivery was spot on. It also lent the slasher - and here's the curious bit - a murderous motive to actually make it possible for Angel Falls to become a commercial leisure and entertainment destination, as opposed to preventing something like this from going forward.The Evans family had a legacy property that was standing in the way of Henry Waters' plans for the town. These scenes were interesting, because they captured an old-school Christmas vibe in indirect ways.And when that alternate-timeline plot twist came along - after Winnie Carruthers (Jane Widdop) wished under the Aurora to become non-existent - it took me by complete and utter surprise. I did not at all guess the story would go in that direction. \"It's a Wonderful Knife\" certainly scored big on that count.The movie became leagues more suspenseful and thrilling after that magical faux-pas and began to pace toward the finish line, delivering little vicious presents along the way.Despite its plot being moderately cheesy and somewhat corny, both Halloween and Christmas confluenced in this movie, and that is not easy to accomplish.Henry Waters' ability to mesmerize an entire town deserved, in my opinion, extended focus. I also wish they showed more killer action and explored the Aurora magic lore, both of which would've added more depth to this story.A little Dickensian style Christmas magic and more than one Scrooge 'type' made this plot feel like a strangely fascinating rip-off of some of the Xmas movies that have come and gone.For some odd reason, \"It's a Wonderful Knife\" was a cliché and yet also a gift that kept giving. Suffice to say, it was the most surprising feel-good movie of the year.",
    "19": "I absolutely love Justin. He's never been one of my favs but I've always found him solid. The scariest part of this movie was seeing Justin's Passion go down the drain. He's not a master of horror but he gave one of the best performances in any horror movie which is jeepers kreepers. It's pretty hard to top that acting job and he's done some solid work since. He's good at comedy but what was this? Story sucked, not enough Christmas. No Christmas music during the horror scenes which is just wrong. Cute characters and I don't care about the LGBTQ part in fact seeing those two cuties kiss was the only saving grace.",
    "20": "I really enjoyed the movie. I thought Justin Long was great and the whole concept was pretty cool. Almost like a Freaky Friday or Totally Killer. The cast did decent for what they were working with. The kills weren't original, but the gore and effects were pretty sweet. I'm a huge fan of both Joel McHale and Justin Long. Joel from \"The Soup\" days, and Justin from Jeepers Creepers and, most recently, Barbarian. I love how versatile Justin Long is. He can play Jess' boyfriend in New Girl and be the biggest dork, then play an evil Mayor in Its a Wonderful Knife and absolutely kill it! If you like cheesy slashers with gore and fun kills, you'll enjoy this.",
    "21": "I had been hoping to see this movie for a very long time and I was so glad I did. This movie like Totally Killer and Happy Death Day does what it sets out to do. Taking a classic family movie and adding a great killer twist to it. The premise is something I would have never thought of, but wow did it hook me. The script is smart and kills are pretty good but do at times look a little fake. Justin Long and Jane Widdop are great in their roles and the message of the film never loses it strength. Overall this movie is a great time and for fans of Scream and Hallmark movies this is truly a classic to remember.",
    "22": "Granted the only thing scary in this comic horror is that Jane Widdop looks like the odd, unfriendly Katie Wix from Collingwood and Joel McHale ( so good as the slimy boss in' Ted') like a bearded Alan, which did distract me this is a rather enjoyable Xmas style Scream horror that reminded me, in style at least, of the equally colourful The Killer Book Club and Totally Killer.The characters lacked the depth of Totally Killer , there is no tension or suspense and killer's identity is well signposted early (something T. K got right) but the premise (based on the classic It's a Wonderful Life) is unusual and like the aforementioned horror films; if Elsie and Molly wanted me to recommend any horrors then I would these three.",
    "23": "This movie made me cringe more than anything. As some previous reviews stated, the all inclusive thing is getting a bit old (all personality types and races) It's way too over the top in this movie. I get it.... Hollywood is gonna keep pushing it no matter what for the new generations.I found the story to be cringe worthy as well. Plenty of eyerollers and scenes where I had to take a deep breath just to continue. Somehow, it was just barely entertaining enough to stick to the end which is why I gave it 3 stars, but do yourself a favor and skip this one. Even as a cheesy horror slasher that can sometimes be good, this wasn't the winner.",
    "24": "In It's a Wonderful Knife, I nearly praised everything. The story and the themes it deals with, performances of the cast, especially the one of Widdop, direction, screenplay, dramatic moments, soundtrack, gore, mystery elements, Christmas theme, cinematography, and ending are all excellent and, from my perspective, flawless.Regarding the flaws, to tell the truth, I cannot find too many except for two. First, I wished that the movie had more gore and violence. Second, the movie didn't exactly explain why went into the alternate universe were she doed not actually exist.But these flaws are nothing in front of all the excellent elements that I mentioned at the beginning of my review, and they won't prevent me from giving an excellent score to the movie. That is why regarding the score, I gladly give It's a Wonderful Knife 9 out of 10.",
    "25": "With a very strong influence from Wes Craven' s Scream, came this cute supernatural slasher.It has a little bit of everything in a slasher and also in a Christmas movie, but having a weird result, with a weird feeling by the end.I'm pretty sure that by this time next year I won't remember anything about it. Maybe I'll remember the feeling of watching it and thinking: It wasn't original, but it was cute.It's not a waste of time by any means, but it's just meh...\nI didn't hate it, I actually liked it...\nBut... yeah... Watch it, and you'll see what im talking about.Or watch Scream instead.",
    "26": "I enjoyed the campy combination of Christmas, Halloween, Hallmark Channel, and It's a Wonderful Life. The Mask Guy character was not consistent--was it a clown, a demon, or some dude in a suit? Maybe that was the point, but it seemed like after-the-fact planning.Messaging in the movie was positive without being over-done. I loved seeing the transformation of a couple characters and the positive messaging.There is enough slashing in the movie to have that surprise element at times; a bit of superstition and supernatural but that doesn't take over the movie. For me it was a fun story and adaptation of a great old movie.",
    "27": "This was way better than I expected. Horror comedies have never been my favourite genre in horror, but this, this is now one of my favourites. I had only watched the OG film when I was young so I was going into it kinda blank but, from what I remember this horror spin really fit the bill. I will say the kills do look fake but that never really bothered me ( expect when my friend pointed it out to me when watching the movie ). Jane Widdop and Justin Long were really good, they went up and beyond in every scene. I also love the romance plot line, that was a really nice touch to the story. Truly I know this might now be for everyone but for me and my friend we had a really really fun time.",
    "28": "I didn't hate it but it could have been better. I think the lead actress acting was terrible though and could have a been a little better.I understand the bad reviews but I think everyone missed the memo on the fact it was meant to be a little tacky, it is a comedy/horror after all. It could have been funnier though I think, the comedy was too subtle. The only time I actually laughed was when the kid outside the house got kicked in the nuts.To be honest the only reason I actually watched it to begin with was because its a Justin Long movie. I'd enjoy anything he stars in. Also I think Jessica Mcleod (Bernie) would have suited the leading character better. Her acting wasn't all that bad.",
    "29": "I watched \"It's a Wonderful Knife\" even though it was on low quality, the moment I saw the trailer, it really called my attention. The first time I saw the movie two days later of its release, I loved the characters, traveling into another dimension, the killings and most importantly, the reveals. The movie was similar to Happy Death Day 2U by traveling to another dimension and Totally Killer by re-stopping the Killer wearing an Angel costume. Revealing the first Killer was similar to Black Christmas and granting to wish herself out of existence was similar to Freaky, not knowing who's Winnie.",
    "30": "This movie is quite okay. However, and unfortunately, annoying and forced in some parts. Okay, but not as good as other current 80s/90s inspired horror movies (such as \"Totally Killer\" or \"Thanksgiving\"). Some scenes were pretty cool filmed though and overall the film is well edited.The plot is interesting and the cast is well chosen. However, they missed the chance to make this movie a big hit and great addition to the latest films of the same genre.Also, a bit more nailbiting and thrilling moments would have been great. Often, the murders happen a bit too fast. But as mentioned above, some of them were pretty cool filmed and presented in an artistic way.",
    "31": "I've been really enjoying this horror trend lately of a whodunit-slasher with a creative twist. Every one of them I've seen so far has been really enjoyable. So I had high hopes for 'It's a Wonderful Knife'. Sadly this was the first one to get it wrong in my opinion.I had hoped for a really clever story where the search for the identity of the killer would coincide with the main character doing her alternative universe thing. This was not really the case. It's a very mucky story and it's often unclear what exactly is happening and what character's motives are. It was not the story I wanted to see.The other big problem was that the characters were not likeable enough. All the other films like this have had really likeable characters, particularly in the lead role, and it is easy to get behind them and follow their journey. That was not the case here.The film goes for some laughs, but is rarely funny. The killer is kind of menacing, but the characters are so flat and unfleshed out that it sucks a lot of the tension out of the kills. So the film is also rarely scary. None of the characters ever seem to have a proper emotional reaction to things that happen either. All in all the film was a disappointment. 4/10.",
    "32": "I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I like all of the stars - Joel McHale, Justin Long, Katharine Isabell, William B Davis.... I enjoy movies and TV shows with an \"It's a Wonderful Life\" theme. What I don't enjoy are movies that feel the need to have everyone \"represented.\" The two siblings are both gay as is the aunt and the geekygirl. The white grandfather has a black granddaughter who's dating a white guy. And that is the sole reason this was made. There's no real story. There's no build up, no explanation of anything other than \"it just is,\" no moral to be learned (as in all the other iterations of this classic tale)... This is just a vehicle for current year ideology. Period.I am really surprised at how bad the aforementioned actors actually were. I know that they can act. I've seen them do it. Apparently, they were all just in need of a check and were like \"alright, let's get this over with.\"Just.... don't do it.",
    "33": "I don't normally do reviews but this one had so many bad reviews I felt I should add one on what I think.. I liked it. I thought it was cute. It had a rather uplifting story about how anyone can make a difference and how important family can be.It wasn't really a horror movie, it was more about how helping one person can make a difference in their life.The main character was very likable and the bad guy was somebody you couldn't wait to see killed.The characters may be may have been over the top, but it made the story interesting watching.I think it's a good movie for somebody who just wants to watch a Christmas story with a little bit of horror.",
    "34": "It's a Wonderful Knife hits too hard on the story line of the movies it is copying. \"It's a Wonderful Life meets Scream\" is an understatement of a tag line. It is the merged copy of these two films blended together with the appropriate amount of current diversity elements.Everyone is happy except for the characteristic parody of the evil town mayor. What has happened to Justin Long that he now only seems to play these oddball quirky characters that are either upfront selfish or accidently selfish? Whichever reason, he only annoys in this film doing some mid-Atlantic parody of a shyster mayor.Overall the kills are uninspired, the cliches heavy, and every trope of these two films are hit heavily in every chance it is possible.Tired lame filmmaking and plotting galore. Sigh. Only mild in its fun leaving the overall product uninspired and tired from the sense of having to check off as many boxes in the woke cultural identities we have now. I wanted a slasher film that had some black humor. Instead, I got a rainbow and wasted time.",
    "35": "It's A Wonderful Knife has such a ring to it, I just had to see it. Now was it a good or bad film, I'm still not completely sure on either end of that spectrum.On one hand, we have a horror great, Katharine Isabelle, and a handful of cast members that try their hardest to convey their characters in a way that feels festive and lighthearted. On the other hand, we have some extremely cheesy writing and a tone flip flops around like a fish gasping for air.Some of the films choices made zero real world sense and it felt like those choices were just there to propel the film forward, and propel forward it did. The runtime is short and brisk, at just under 90 mins, which did not give the film room to focus on any particular thing except poor Winnie and her mission. There were a few things I wish they had spent more time on and some things I wished were missing from the film entirely.Overall, you could do better and you could do worse. Although there was some pretty shotty directing and writing, the film was still entertaining and short enough to get through without too much strain on the audience. I will say, it was not necessary to see in theaters. I may have had more fun with this film watching it on TV as opposed to the big theatrical experience.2.5 Christmas' out of 5.",
    "36": "Most of the negative reviews seem to be from clowns who seem to be unable to handle even the SMALLEST queer content. We get it, knuckle-draggers, you're fragile. Now rack off.As for this movie, it's far better than it has any right to be, really, even with the cast it has. It's a low-budget-feeling horror homage to the Jimmy Stewart classic about the impact one life can have (which you'd know if you read the title, duh) with Joel McHale, Katherine Isabelle, and William B Davis in an all-too-brief cameo of sorts...then there's Justin Long. Good old reliable Justin Long. The man from Tusk, Barbarian, Zack & Miri, and Galaxy Quest. Justin \"I dare you to put me in a box\" Long. I would GLADLY watch an entire movie of Justin Long as Henry Waters. The man is an ICON! And he's deliciously hammy here. He has more ham than Brick Top from Snatch can shake a dead body at, and it's GLORIOUS.Summary: Ignore the anti \"woke\" haters.",
    "37": "I should start by saying I'm not the biggest Christmas movie fan. I went in without any expectations, only to find out it was a Christmas movie, which didn't excite me at all. To my surprise, it turned out to be a comedy horror, a genre combination I usually don't like because it's often hit or miss, and rarely the former. This missed the mark. The film wasn't funny or scary; it was just Christmasy.The special effects left a lot to be desired; could tell that many things were poorly done and looked too fake, like the blood. The movie probably didn't have a substantial budget, and it felt more like a parody. So much didn't make sense; plot lacked coherence, making it uninteresting, and the opening act... wtf was that opening act? The movie was just all over the place, attempting to juggle too many things at once and ending up as a chaotic mess.The acting wasn't stellar, and the weak writing didn't help. The story wasn't interesting, and many scenes lacked logical consistency, which can be forgivable in a slasher movie if they're fun, but in this case, they weren't. At least let it be fun. The characters weren't great, and had nothing interesting to make you care for them; they all seemed like dumb teenagers.I remember getting more unimpressed as the movie progressed, especially when it unexpectedly veered into Christmas fantasy territory. There were some laughs but while some people found humor in it, I did not share that sentiment. I watched the movie with a biased perspective though, it was a mystery movie night.In the end, it's a low-budget mishmash of comedy, horror, fantasy, whodunit mystery, slasher, and Christmas themes. For me, it just wasn't great, and \"Violent Night\" and \"Love, Actually\" remain the only Christmas movies I've enjoyed. Even then, objectively, I still think the film was messily put together.",
    "38": "I wish this movie was erased from my memory...A dull \"All Inclusive\" (if you know what I mean) wanna be slasher-horror-comedy, which isn't gory, scary or comic, so that left us with a lame script that stole the premise from a Christmas classic and turned it into a boring, forgettable and horrid Halloween/Christmas crossover.Also if you have a brain, you know exactly what would happen as the movie goes by, which is even worst in horror movies because it blows off all the emotion.Also, the amount of LGBT characters is over the top, I mean, we get it, it's a thing this years of inclusion but, you know, chill out a bit...Anyway, don't waste your time on this, mark my words: UNGORY, UNSCARY AND UNFUNNY.",
    "39": "It was a slasher Christmas movie that was quite well shot and put together with a half decent idea,so kudos for everyone else involved with it to make it so awful,the script was just so terrible it was just awkward to watch, the story went nowhere, I genuinely can't believe this was made how it was,nothing makes sense, like nothing at all, the writers didn't even attempt to make a coherent story,it was just painful to watch the actors go through the awful scriptI didn't think i could hate a movie that was essentially a christmas slasher movie so much, i don't mind cheesy, i don't mind low budget, i don't mind ridiculousness, but this is none of that, this is just bad.",
    "40": "It's a Wonderful Knife has a style that is not often seen, possibly a style of its own. It will turn some away, but if you go along with it, then you'll find a lot to like, despite oddball scripting.If questions like \"why are these people making out at family Christmas\" or \"why are so many people calm about dozens of murders happening in a tiny town\" or \"shouldn't this person do that instead of this\" stop you from having the fun the movie wants you to have, then move on. True, the movie could be 30 minutes longer. It could've attempted to add scenes to explain and answer some of these questions. This could've made it better or even worse. The film is more concerned with our lead character surviving a killer in this alternate timeline that she is experiencing. With her POV, she doesn't get to answer these questions that the audience will ask. She's asking them too. The only question she needs to answer is how to get back to her normal life.Despite the script not being perfect, it could've been better or worse, but its intentions don't feel like it wants to be anything more than what it is. Because it feels like it's the product that the filmmakers intended. The thing that holds the movie together the best is the acting, with the highlights being Justin Long and Jane Widdop, among others. By it's nature, the movie isn't \"great\", but it fits into the mold of an easy watch that will be on a fairly steady rotation on Christmas.",
    "41": "Got to see the movie early as part of a Regal promotion, and without exageration I can say this was the worst thing I have ever seen in a movie theater. I mean it was seriously terrible, only two or three actors seemed to give a crap, they must've spent most of the budget getting Joel McHale and Justin Long because the effects looked like they were done by a high schooler. Every single one of the characters were insufferable, dumb, and just flat out lame, I'd also like to point out that Jane Widdop did a good job showing us why you shouldn't characterize drama through heavy breathing. And then there's the plot, let's just say it was intensley flawed and leave it at that. The main problem with this movie is that I have no idea what direction they were trying to take the film, or rather they weren't clear with it at all. What it a genuine attempt at a slasher film? What it supposed to be making fun of slasher films? Or was it just a a nothing film filled with a bullcrap story that they knew was going to suck, which is why it seemed no one cared about making this dumpster fire of a film that couldn't even reach mediocrity. If they made it clear that it was meant to be a joke slasher film and played on the dumb things that happened, then maybe it might've been slightly more enjoyable? Maybe? In the end though we are left with a film with ZERO effort and ZERO creativity. Overall just a dumb, dumb, film and a continous groan. Truly I don't see how anyone can enjoy this.",
    "42": "My wife and I attended a screening of the Shudder Original It's A Wonderful Knife (2023) tonight. The plot revolves around a young woman who saves her town from a serial killer. A year later, tensions rise, leading to arguments within the family to the point our hero wishes for her non-existence. She wakes up in an alternate reality where the killer wasn't stopped, the body count continued, leading her on a course to unravel the situation and bring the killer to justice...again.This movie is directed by Tyler MacIntyre (Tragedy Girls) and stars Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), Jane Widdop (Yellowjackets), Jess McLeod (Andy the Great), Joel McHale (Deliver Us from Evil) and Katharine Isabelle (Ginger Snaps).While the original storyline and Christmas atmosphere show promise, the last twenty minutes falter with prolonged monologues and a disappointing conclusion. Justin Long shines as a funny cliche villain, and the cinematography, especially the city's aerial shots, are stunning. The movie's atmosphere, authentic acting, solid soundtrack, and clean holiday aesthetic were perfect. The slasher elements are solid with great blood splatter and slash scenes (but no real gore). There's a good use of a candy cane in here. Regrettably, the final act is an overacted mess with a weak resolution.In summary, It's A Wonderful Knife is recommended for horror enthusiasts seeking a holiday-themed slasher, but it falls short of its potential. I would give it a 4/10 but suggest watching it once.",
    "43": "'It's a Wonderful Knife' borrows its idea from the 1946 movie 'It's a Wonderful Life'; only this is a slasher horror version. (If you haven't see 'It's a Wonderful Life' yet, I recommend you do.)The first few minutes of 'It's a Wonderful Knife' felt rushed, and for a moment I thought I was watching the film's final act. The characters also seemed to make such stupid mistakes that I almost stopped watching. But give it a chance and you'll soon find there is a reason for this.The film's heroin is Winnie Carruthers (Jane Widdop), who has just killed one of the town's most prominent figures, Henry Waters - who happened to be a serial killer - around Christmas time. Don't worry, this is no spoiler, and you'll understand why I say this when you watch the movie. Henry's family hates Winnie for what she has done, and she feels uneasy around his brother, Buck.Whoosh! The film jumps ahead one year, and its Christmas time again. Winnie's family has moved on, but she still can't come to terms with what has happened. Watching the Northern Lights and wishing she was never born, Winnie's wish is granted. And this is where I'm going to stop telling you what happened, because telling you more might result in spoilers. Lets just say the film was interesting for a while, but - unfortunately - as it progressed, it became a bit silly. By the time it ended, it was just stupid.'It's a Wonderful Life' was a much better film. Being a drama, it also had a much deeper meaning to it. But these are two very different movies, so one can't - and shouldn't really compare them. It would be unfair to do so. If you're into slashers, chances are you'll find 'It's a Wonderful Knife' to be a \"clever\" and different slasher movie.",
    "44": "Horror films that revolve around Christmas have been fun in the past, but I feel that it has been quite some time since the last great one. It's a Wonderful Knife, which is clearly a play on the Christmas classic It's a Wonderful Life, both in story and its title, is now streaming on Shudder. Even though I had no expectations for it, I was quite underwhelmed. To me, it is very unfortunate when a premise seems promising and starts kind of strong, but never does anything to take that to the next level. Here is why I believe you can skip this one.After a serial killer kills her brother on Christmas Eve, Winnie Carruthers (Jane Widdop) wishes she was never born. Well, she happens to make this wish while looking at the Aurora Borealis and her wish comes true. She wakes up in an alternate reality where nobody knows who she is. Her family still exists, but things are very different (and they don't know her either). Befriending an unlikely companion, they race against the clock to take down the killer before Christmas, in hopes of reversing her wish. It's the horror/slasher version of It's a Wonderful Life, which has a nice message (as does this film), but unlike that film, there's not much enjoyment here, other than some of the humour.Justin Long plays a character by the name of Henry Walters and just like always, he brings his A-Game. His character is meant to be hammy and ridiculous and he just went for it. He is the worst kind of person you can think of, and while he does that with a smile on his face the whole time, I couldn't help but enjoy it and laugh. There are also a few nice self-aware jokes that had me chuckling, but in general, this film is just dull. Even when it comes to the slasher element, it's an R-rated film and there is nothing you haven't seen before if you like that kind of thing. It just felt as if a Scream movie was taken overly seriously and that just didn't work for the film overall.It's a Wonderful Knife, as I said, does begin strong because the opening sequence made me feel for the character of Jane. For that reason, I was rooting for her to succeed, but I ended up caring about other characters more by the end. The best arc of the film has to go to Bernie Simon, played by Jess McLeod. Her performance was solid and her character evolved in a very nice way by the end of the film. Sadly, I do think the storylines of Jess and Bernie clashed a bit and I'm not against where their story goes, it just didn't feel earned to me. In the end, this is a neat idea that didn't do enough. I'd say give it a pass, even though it does have its moments.",
    "45": "Angel Falls has a greedy businessman Henry Waters who is eyeing the properties he can take over, by any means possible. Winnie is his best friend's daughter. Angel Falls gets a slasher called The Angel, starting Angel killings during Christmas. When Winnie and her brother are attacked, she fights back and eventually kills The Angel. An year later, the town has moved on and Winnie hasn't. Being ignored by her family and being cheated upon by her boyfriend, she wishes to have never been born infront of Aurora Borealis which grants her wish and Winnie is in a parallel world where she was never born and the killer is on the loose. Will Winnie be able to stop the killer and get back to her world, forms rest of the story.I wished with Justin Long part of the slasher film, despite him resorting to the over the top comedy, it would still offer some decent fun. Sadly the film remained flat right from the first scene. The worst part was the film lacking novelty and not trying enough to entertain. It has barely any memorable characters and there are plenty of them. Barring Winnie, others suffer from poor characterization and the short runtime doesn't help as the story gets all over the place in the final act. The killings too were shabby but then it is in sync with the character who is the actual killer. For a horror comedy, this slasher film doesn't offer any decent kills neither any funny scene.",
    "46": "The film opens with Winnie and her brother's group of friends being attacked by a masked slasher serial killer.However, only her and her brother survive the ordeal.After she kills the culprit, by electrocuting him.Fast forward a year later...and nothing is going right for Winnie.Her brother gets all the attention from her family; she catches her boyfriend cheating on her...and it's her first Christmas without her best friend to share it with.So, she wishes she were dead...which causes her to be whisked into an alternate dimension where she never existed.Unfortunately...the flow of how this all plays out, is not only implausible...it's very poorly developed...and simply comes off as nonsensical.The whole thing is a ridiculous mash up of Scream and It's A Wonderful Life (or, as the film references...I Know What You Did Last Summer and A Christmas Carol)...only, without the angel (or ghosts).Or any sort of nuance.The main problem with this film...is that a sci-fi film requires a consistent form of logic in order to work.The recent film Totally Killer!, for example, does a good job on this front.This film, however...not only has NO MYSTERY to it (which is the only thing that makes a Scream-style slasher actually work)...it requires an absolute suspension of disbelief in order to appreciate.First, in regards to how she manages to kill the killer (in her own reality)- in fact, in regards to how a majority of the kills go down...how the outcast girl has answer for everything already plotted out...and, particularly, in regards to how their characters are supposed to be high school students.All of which comes off as lazy, uninspired...and completely unnecessary.Not to mention regurgitated...but I guess that is to be expected.The other problem with this film...is that it's too heavily imbalanced.Meaning...there is too much It's A Wonderful Life...and not enough Knife, to make it enjoyable.But it's the lack of mystery that is it's real downfall.We find ourselves watching Winnie try to convince others about a mystery that's already been solved.So there's nothing to keep you engaged.Which is, ultimately, why it's so hard to enjoy this film.Sure...they attempt to explain the \"science\" behind what happens...and throw in a twist.However, it comes off as incredibly forced.And doesn't particularly add any mystery to the whole ordeal.In the end, it seems like the writers simply don't appreciate the role you play, as the viewer, in this whole scenario.Which is the cardinal sin of filmmaking.And this isn't even going into how stupid the ending is...Simply put, this is nothing more than a poorly done Christmas slasher you'll have to struggle to enjoy.3 out of 10.",
    "47": "Preparing for her small town's Christmas festivities, a teen upset over her role in stopping a mass murderer the year before that no one else cares to acknowledge anymore causes her to transport into an alternate timeline where the killer is still on the loose killing off the town and forces her to stop him again.This was a highly impressive and enjoyable genre effort with quite a lot to like about it. One of the finer features here is the generally impressive setup that allows for the film to go overboard with the rather unique and creative concept. The early setup involving the rampage with the killer and how she stops his spree leading to the resentment she has when that time of the year rolls around again as her desperation to resolve the feelings she has about the situation serves well enough to be a likable foundation for the desire to start her life over. Once it happens and she finds herself in the alternate timeline where everything's in a different headspace, there's tons of fun here with the series of revelations at play where the new fates of everyone are brought up as the discoveries made are generally fun enough. When this goes beyond the solid setup, it has quite a lot of fun with the stalking and slashing scenes. The opening rampage through the present timeline where the killer pulls off several chilling ambushes at a victim's house and a Christmas party leads to a solid chase through the woods where they finally stop him, serving as a solid setup for the later scenes to come once she's arrived in the alternate timeline. Those are far more vicious and striking with the sudden appearance of the killer out of nowhere and unleashing a strong death sequence including sequences at the pier when she first arrives, a fun sequence at a party where it takes out a random partygoer in a suspenseful stalking scene, and the big encounter at the movie theater where the use of the location provides this with some intriguing stalking set in an unusual location. As this shows off the impressive design of the killer who has an appropriate holiday theme and distinctive look, there's a lot to like here that holds it up overall. There are some minor flaws with this one that hold it down somewhat. The biggest drawback here is the final half where it tends to offer up some underwhelming work with the revelations that come about and resolve the mystery of the killer. The first instance of solving the killer's identity is a wholly unremarkable confrontation that doesn't feel like much of a conclusion with how it plays out, and then sets up a lame and underwhelming final confrontation which has the lamest reasoning to go through it and an equally underwhelming sense of action to play out. This becomes quite impactful with how it sets up the flaws at the very end which is not the right way to end the movie. On top of that, there's also the convoluted twists that are utilized here but are glossed over merely to hit a preferred running time in this section which also makes the film feel rushed at this point which combine to hold this back.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, and mild drug use.",
    "48": "Genuinely got quite excited as the film opened: Like Justin Long; his schtick is the best element of the film.Tyler MacIntyre just can't seem to pull the same result from the rest of the cast, & as I just read in another review, the result is hollow.Comedy-horror can work really well ...and is probably my preferred orientation on the scary movie genre. But let's look at both aspects.Firstly the comedic: Regarding orientation, the film is LGBTQI+ friendly, an obvious boon & Katherine Isabelle who plays the aunt produces one of the only jokes that land successfully. I'm unsure who the comedy is aimed at - there is some swearing - but I'm maybe guessing early mid-teens.Horror: My own shadow has given me more of a shock! But perhaps that's where I've misplaced my expectations. There's certainly sone blood, but compared to 'Martyrs' which I watched only days back, it's certainly not gory.A safe, if disappointing watch probably aimed at mid-teens.

    "49": "This was a movie that I was turned on via going to the Gateway Film Center. I saw part of the trailer and put it on a list of 2023 films to check out. Personally, I wish this would have been pushed to December so I could have made it a featured review. Coming out in November, I can't fault the team behind this since that's when it seems Christmas season starts.Synopsis: after saving her town from a psychotic killer, Winnie Carruthers' (Jane Widdop) life is less than wonderful. When she wishes she'd never been born, she finds herself in a nightmare parallel universe where without her, things could be much, much worse.We start with seeing a commercial. Henry Waters (Justin Long) is trying to build a complex that will feature shops, entertainment and I believe either a hotel or housing. He is trying to take this nice town of Angel Falls and commercialize. He thinks that will make him beloved even more than he already is. I get the vibe here that this is borrowing from Gremlins 2 with Clapp.Working for Henry is David Carruthers (Joel McHale). It sounds like he collaborated with Henry's father and should have taken over the business. Instead, due to nepotism, it went to Henry. In order for this complex to go in, they need Roger Evans (William B. Davis) to sell his house. It is borderline considered to be a historical location, but Henry killed that. Roger's family built up this town and he plans to leave his house to his granddaughter, Cara (Hana Huggins).Now David is married to Judy (Erin Boyes) and they have this happy family. It is Christmas so her sister, Gale Prescott (Katharine Isabelle) comes over with her girlfriend, Karen Simmons (Cassandra Naud). David and Judy also have two children. Their daughter is Winnie and the golden child is Jimmy (Aiden Howard).This Christmas is turned upside down when a masked killer, dressed up as the angel on the community tree, starts to kill off members of the community. As the synopsis said though, Winnie stops him. We then see the aftereffects a year later. She lost her best friend, her boyfriend is cheating on her, she doesn't get into her dream college and her brother's early Christmas present blows hers away. This leads to her wishing that she was never born.That is where we get to the crux of the story. She wasn't born so therefore, the killer wasn't stopped. She knows who it is and they're on to her. In this alternative universe, Henry's younger brother who is a screw up is the sheriff, Buck (Sean Depner). Winnie's family lost Jimmy and since she wasn't born, they are now childless. This causes them to fall into a deep depression. Winnie seeks the aid of Bernie Simon (Jess McLeod), who is called 'freak' by her classmates to figure out how she can undo what she did before it is too late.I think that should be enough for a recap and introduction to the characters. If you haven't noticed, this is a play on It's a Wonderful Life, that beloved Christmas movie. Since I don't watch trailers, I thought it was a clever pun title for a holiday horror film. It is more than that though. We are taking that story and giving it a genre twist. That was something about this that I did appreciate. Our set up shows us who the killer is, has them eliminated, seeing the effects a year later to what happened before plunging us in this different version. As someone who loves movies that features alternative timelines or even just time travel, I'm here for that.Now that I've set that up, let me get into how this works for the movie. The best thing this does is setting the baseline of our characters. We know that Winnie is dating Robbie Olenger (Jason Fernandes). Now there is a subplot here that I noticed from the original timeline. This gets confirmed with him soon after. It seemed odd, but it was also a minor thing so I didn't pay too much attention there. We see that despite David working for Henry, his family is still happy. Bernie is bullied and Winnie is nice to her. When we shift to this other time, things are much different and it makes sense to motivations as to why.Moving with this, the heart of It's a Wonderful Life is George Bailey learning why he should be born. That life isn't better without him. That is what we get here with Winnie. She sees what would happen to her town if that was the case. With both movies, there is that idea that when you're depressed, you think everyone would be better off without you. These both show that the ripples that happen when someone isn't there to alter characters. Winnie touches people's lives in ways she doesn't realize. I want to credit Widdop here. I thought she fit this character well. We see a range of emotions from here which I thought made this work.Let me then shift this over to the horror aspect. I do feel that the slasher element is front in center for the opening act. When we hit the end of the first act, it becomes more of an incidental thing. The killer pops up to do a kill and that is solid. Our characters do have to avoid the killer. It did feel like it takes a backseat though for the more heartwarming side of the story. We do have a good cast of characters though that I was invested in so I'll still credit that. That is one of the important aspects for me.Since I've brought up the characters, let me delve more into them. I've already said my piece on Winnie and Widdop's performance. I like McLeod as this mousy counterpart to her. She's been beaten down by everyone for so long. We see growth there as she helps Winnie. I think these two share the screen well. I loved the roles by McHale, Isabelle, Long and Depner. They aren't all likable characters, but they get a reaction out of me. Isabelle brought good comedy. McHale gets to show range here and I appreciated that. Outside of that, the rest rounded this out for what was needed.All that is left then is filmmaking. Now to the other part of what makes a slasher to work, the kills. We get a decent array here. The killer tends to use a knife, but we also get like a large candy cane for one. There is a car battery kill as well. I'm not sure that would work like it does, but I'll give leeway. The practical gore was good. There was CGI with kills that you couldn't do without it and also blood spray. I did notice these. I do think that the cinematography was good. They frame things well. I'd also say the soundtrack fit what was needed.In conclusion, this is a decent modern Christmas slasher film. I love that this is a dark parody of It's a Wonderful Life. There is good heart that comes from this part of the story. Winnie and Bernie do well carrying that story. The slasher elements are used throughout, but I also feel they take a backseat. The acting is good here. Our leads are solid with McHale, Isabelle and Long being bright spots as secondary characters. I'd say this is well made. The practical effects lead the way there with the CGI bringing it down slightly. There was a bit of a pacing issue, but that's what I have with most slasher films. This is still a fun one and would recommend giving it a viewing if you want a slasher with a bit more of a message.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",
    "50": "You'll have a gay ole time with this Freaky and Totally Killer Christmas Death Day flick.Wow, this had a VERY limited theatrical run. I really wanted to see this, but before I knew it, it vanished from theatres. Luckily, it didn't take months or even a year to come out on streaming. And what a nice early Christmas present - I really enjoyed this.To be fair, it's not perfect and let's get the subgenre/synopsis out of the way: the punny title alone should tell everything you need to know. One character wishes she was more like George Bailey, gets her wish and of course, the town's worse off. Only this time, it's centered around a serial killer.In addition to the references I stated in my intro (Freaky, Happy Death Day and Totally Killer) you could also pair this with A(ny) Christmas Carol and Back to the Future Part II. Sadly, though, it's the absolute weakest of them all. Still, I enjoyed it. It did have a little bit of heart, some huge laughs - once I really did laugh out loud and had to rewind (more on that character in a bit,) I liked some of the world building and it did have one huge positive in the form of a Weird - O.The very best character, by a landslide, and the only one I really cared about, was the quirky sidekick to the Final Girl. Aptly named \"Weird - O.\" She gave me the most laughs and had the most depth all-around. Everyone else, was just wrote-by-numbers.As the movie progresses, it does get a bit weirder and kinda runs out of steam, but as a whole, it's a short, fun, funny, VERY inclusive/modern Christmas Slasher/Comedy. Recommended, and while it didn't make my top 25 favorite Christmas movies, which I wish it had, it did earn a nice spot on the Honorable Mentions list.***Final Thoughts: What KILLS ME THOUGH...is when a character has the opportunity to kill the killer and solve the mystery/end the carnage and decides against it. It happens here TWICE. I would go ALLLL Tommy Jarvis on the murderer without hesitation, whether that broke the law or not. (Incidentally, after I write this, I will be consulting with my Defense Attorney friend to see if this would be criminal or not. Still, in the heat of the moment and this happened to me, I wouldn't care either way.)This frustrated me so much, I did end up lowering my overall rating/score. Now, yes of course, because *movie*, it had to happen to progress the story. It still irked me off unbelievably. Made me miss Sidney Prescott/ Sam Barrera so much.",
    "51": "Let's start with the title. Dreadful. Yes it's a play on the beloved Xmas classic but as a title it's lazy and stupid. Doesn't even make any sense.The slasher genre is so overdone now that to really stand out you need to focus on your kills and this movie simply doesn't deliver. All of the victims are killed in really straightforward and frankly boring ways.Characters. There's not a likeable person in this entire movie. Justin Long gives a good camp performance as the Mayor but other than that you won't be invested in anyone and you simply don't care who gets killedThe gimmick here is Christmas time travel and they wasted an great opportunity to have a movie horror fans return to every year. Sadly that won't happen here as this is a one and done experienceIf you want to see a decent groundhog day style slasher then Happy Death Day has it in the bag.4 stars and that's a festive gift as it's really only worth 2 or 3.",
    "52": "It's funny, I did not realize the double meaning of the title until the title came up in the movie.The movie literally starts like a mini slasher film. Watching it I felt like it was going by far too fast but then I realized the movie just began.The aftermath of a slasher attack finds a final girl contempt with life being a survivor. Then she wishes on the aurora borealis to never be born and getting her wish we discover what happens when the horror film does not end. Not even a sequel just never ends.But this is not really a horror move late for Halloween. This is as much of a Christmas movie as it is a horror movie hence the It's A Wonderful Life plot. Wrapping the two concepts together did not mix that well, but I did love the premise. It fell off in its third act as if though it did not know what it wanted to do next and I felt they could have found a better final girl, but this maybe because they are trying something new with her but if you are a fan it horror this might not work for you. Not much of a Christmas movie either but I still like the premise a lot to enjoy the whole thing.I mean Justin Long in a Horror flick seems to always work.",
    "53": "I did not enjoy this at all. I was hopeful for it but nope. A lot of the kills looked way too fake. Most of the comedy was cringe, and the over indulgent queer relationships were a bit much. I get representing and being inclusive, but it just made it seem not real that there were so many. It would be like making a ghetto slums of New York gang movie and only having Asians play all the parts, as there are normally far less of those types in real ghettos.Justin Long was absolutely amazing in this and the main actress was also quite good. I didn't like the amount of making fun of the \"weirdo\" all the time. At some point I was expecting them to stop being so mean to her.The kills weren't even B movie kills either, like the production values were high enough that they could have made some really realistic kills, but everything was just badly acted and always had too much jank.",
    "54": "We have another movie that takes a classic Christmas, such as It's a Wonderful Life (1946), and give them the treatment of making them a Christmas horror/slasher movie; these kinds of movies could work, or they cannot depend on the premise. The movie It's a Wonderful Knife (2023) has a premise that could work in a horror movie with good things about it, but the way things are setup and how the movie executes the main plot with its twist, it will either not make sense, or it will not fit with what the movie is trying to do.The main character Winnie Carruthers played by Jane Widdop, though the performance is good, the character herself can be standard or unlikable at times, though it has a couple of moments where she is at least a good character; she has some smart moments when going up against the killer, and the reasons for why she makes her wish could have been better. The mayor played by Justin Long, has a good and weird performance, but it is obvious who he really is, and his character is hated by other people because of him owning the town; his character does not do much except to look and seem suspicious because of a killer running around. Also, I will add that there are a lot of side characters that just seem like horror annoying cliches.I like the look of the killer with it dressing in all white, and it being an angel fits what the premise is based on; the killer does brutal bloody kills either with a stylized knife or Christmas items; despite the fitting killer and the entertaining brutal kills, the way the movie executes the idea in the movie was poor. The reasons why people do not like the main character or ignore her did not make sense, and when certain things are revealed, I was a bit confused and was wondering about the direction it was going to take; also, the movie was not that despite being called a horror comedy, there were only little scenes that could be unintentionally funny.The movie It's a Wonderful Knife (2023) is not awful, but it has a promising premise that would have worked if the main character were more likable, the execution of scenes was better, the reveal of the killer was less obvious; this is not a movie that will become a Christmas horror movie that people are going to rewatch that much, instead you might watch it and forget it a couple hours after watching. It has good things about it that are entertaining, but the movie in the end is a standard Christmas horror movie that could have been better than what we got.",
    "55": "That was my first thought when I saw this movie coming out and when I read the plot summary. These kind of movies like Happy Death Day, Happy Death Day 2U, Freaky, Totally killer and now It's a Wonderful Knife seem to generate some profit because we've been getting lots of them lately. And actually I don't really mind because I usually enjoy them and they were a bit of fresh air, but now that we've had so many of these I think that this trend should end. At this point I like all of them more or less but I feel like they decrease in quality and overall fun.Anyway I like Christmas movies and I saw that many familiar faces were in this, I was most excited about seeing Katharine Isabelle and the girl from the Influencer movie from last year because I thought that she was really good in that. The movie follows the typical formula like the other ones but some things that stood out to me was that the characters were really overdone for example Justin Long's character and his brother. For me that was too over the top to enjoy and took away from the movies believability. On the other hand I really enjoyed the look of the Killer with that blank white mask and the white robe, which just like snow, has a great contrast to the red blood from the murder's. All in all if you like these kind of movies you might enjoy this one but I think they should really stop making these at this point. [6,1/10]",
    "56": "So in the beginning we get the satisfaction of Winnie killing the murderer. I enjoyed the setup and motivation behind the killer.Then we get to see the community coping with the murders and how Winnie is coping.You get a lot of subtle glimpses that contrast with the side where the killings weren't stopped.Once on the other side it switches up with a culture shock for Winnie. After all in this world the killer didn't get stoppedOverall I loved the characters they did a great job of quickly outlining characters that were barely in the movie. I found myself invested in the main characters and the story. It focuses more on surviving and then focusing on ending the killer.You don't see any mystery because we know who the killer is after all we saw them die in the 1st world. This is about trying to find allies and survive long enough to end the killerIf you like it's a wonderful life and enjoy horror comedies you will love this movie. After all you get double the Clarences.If you enjoyed Tucker and Dale vs evil you will like this. If you just want dead bodies and no stories and no interesting characters I recommend the 80s horror slasher movies over the Saw movies.This isn't a spoiler but Winnie aunt is married to a woman. If you can't deal with that then don't watch it maybe try the Saw movies.",
    "57": "Quite a few movies I have watched of late start well, the premise is there, the atmosphere for a potential classic even, then whoops.A killer is on the loose at the start, and i kind of wished that is how it would have stayed.Because what we get is a jump about 20 minutes in to a movie where the main character says something ( in this case i wish i wasn't born) and they are transported to another time etc etc ( yeah you know the kind of thing) and then have to do whatever to get back to their original time.This aspect kind of flattened the movie somewhat for me, the slasher element seemed to take a back seat, too bad I guess.They people giving this 10 are fake surely?, this is a solid 6 or 7 all day long\nI did not find it particularly christmassy n a warm, Hallmark cheesy way, neither did i find it particularly funny or scary, especially as the movie went on.The characters were a little flat in general but the lead Jane Widdup was excellent and there are some recognisable faces in there too including the excellent Justin Long, Katherine ( Ginger Snaps ) Isabelle, Cassandra ( The Influencer) Naud and Jessica Mcleod from One Of Us Is Lying.Give it a try but dont expect too much.",
    "58": "I noticed early on that there was something oddly relaxing and comforting about this movie. The way it was filmed triggered something deep in my soul. Then I realized it... this movie is, without a doubt, what it would be like if Lifetime or Hallmark started making horror movies.It is filmed in Vancouver, and the town looks like the town you would see is any Lifetime holiday movie. The houses are on very plain streets and appear to be unnecessarily fancy. The houses look like what AI imagines \"upper middle class\" looks like when it shuts its eyes to go to sleep after taking an extra Ambien.The interior shots have rooms that are very nondescript. Sometimes it looks like they aren't even in a room at all, maybe a hallway, but they put up some decorations to make it look like a room. Sometimes you question if they are in an office building or a house. It is hard to tell.The writing is very weak. At some points in the movie, things will happen and you will just have to be like, \"sure, why not?\"It gets ridiculous!! The town becomes this wild dystopian nightmare, and it is sooooooooo cheesy and theatrical. All in this small Lifetime / Hallmark world. It is BONKERS.So, naturally, I loved it. I had so much fun watching this. I am sure some people are going to say this review wasn't helpful because I gave it such a high rating - just going off of the overall rating. But I don't care. If you like horror, Christmas, Hallmark holiday, and Lifetime movies, then you not only have the entertainment taste fitting of the gods, but you also have a real treat on your hands with this one.",
    "59": "Spoiler Free. (I think)Just like the Frank Capra classic it's named after, It's a Wonderful Knife, at its heart, is a story about love and family, but this time with a very welcome big heaping scoop of LGBTQ representation and with a little murder and mayhem lovingly placed underneath the Christmas Tree.Don't expect too many scares, but do expect to see some outstanding performances from the cast. Jane Widdop (Winnie) and Jessica McLeod (Bernie) are cast perfectly for their roles and their on screen chemistry is the real driving force behind this movie. Katharine Isabelle (Gale) plays the fun Aunt that we all wished we had, and Cassandra Naud (Karen) is cast alongside her as her wife. Justin Long (Waters) just seems to revel in his role as mayor. Joel McHale (David), William B. Davis (Roger), and Aiden Howard (Jimmy) all play their roles perfectly.The editing can be a bit choppy at times, and I wasn't the biggest fan of the cinematography. That's not saying the cinematography was bad, just not my taste. There is a fair bit of gore, but nothing too extreme. Even though I knew it was going to happen, one of the murders actually caught me off guard and surprised the hell out of me.There are some truly heartfelt moments between the characters between all the chaos and murder, and it's when Aunt Gale joins forces with Winnie and Bernie that the movie seems to find some really solid footing. There is also a special easter egg placed as homage to another Christmas story early on in the movie, see if you can pick it out.A special shoutout needs to go to Katharine Isabelle for some of the best lines in the movie, delivered with absolute sarcastic perfection, which made the whole audience laugh. I still need to know what the backstory of that Aguilerian Thong is! (or better yet, what is an Aguilerian Thong?)In the end, It's a Wonderful Knife, delivers some great performances, and for me, that's the best Christmas present of all."
