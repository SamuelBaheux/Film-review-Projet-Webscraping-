    "0": "First there was Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, then Twilight and now we have The Hunger Games. Let me start by saying much kudos to the film on being popular by word of the mouth because normally we are bombarded with crazy advertising for a film like this but instead I didn't see that much honestly. I think the film relied more on it's fan base than anything for the box office numbers and it really did pay off. My fiancé and I actually waited until this weekend to see The Hunger Games to see it with a not so crowded theater and still it was pretty packed. I didn't know what to expect and to be honest I thought I would never get into this film but I'm surprised to say that I really did like this movie and actually bought the book because of it. For a long time it felt like the teenager's intelligence was just being insulted with the bad writing with Twilight and I gave up hope for them. The Hunger Games is an intelligent well thought out story that has a clever take on our society and isn't afraid to tell you the truth.The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer surrounding districts. As a punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol by the districts, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the \"tributes\" must fight in an arena controlled by the Capitol until there is only one victor. Katniss, a 16-year-old girl from District 12, volunteers for the Hunger Games in place of her younger sister. Peeta, a baker's son is also selected. Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their drunken mentor, former Games victor, instructs them to watch and learn the talents of the other tributes. They get to go on TV and get treated like celebrities until the games begin and now must face survival and death.I thought the film was very clever on what would life be like if we were put into situations like this. I thought the \"tributes\" were treated more like American Idol contestants and that was very believable. I liked the characters and they were not only believable but they were likable. Jennifer Lawrence does a really good job as Katniss along with Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks. The costumes were so creepy but believable that they would be considered the high fashions of the time. The action scenes were very exciting and also so sad and intense. These are kids who have to not only kill each other but face the possibility of dying before they can experience so much of what life has to offer. My only complaint of the film was the shaky cam effect. I don't mind when there's not much action going on in the movie, but when the action is happening, we couldn't tell who was getting killed and what was going on. Thank goodness this wasn't 3D because I would've had a big headache. Also I felt like the film cuts short on giving any of the other tributes any kind of character development that you really don't feel for them as much.But I thought this was a great movie and a good start to the summer blockbuster films. I have to admit that I will probably buy this when it's released on blu ray and will read the books, it seems like a really interesting story. I'm looking forward to the sequels and most of all I'm just glad that we will have a franchise again where the story is just plain exciting and we're dying to see what happens to our hero's next. I would recommend for you to see this film before it leaves the theaters. It's one that should be experienced on the big screen because of the scope of the movie, the sets are great and it's a movie that you really could get into. Looking forward to seeing what Katniss will do next now that she's ticked off the rich.8/10",
    "1": "OK, first let me admit that I haven't read the books, and I didn't even know they existed: I was taken to the cinema by my girlfriend, who saw something in the trailers I didn't which made her all excited. So, I sat there with a clear mindset, no expectations, no prejudice, no background info whatsoever. First things first: whoever invented the the \"let's shake the camera all around because it makes the movie so much more lifelike\" and convinced others to follow him or her, should be shot. Twice, in fact, just to be sure...It is really annoying, and so unnecessary: it is not making anything more real. For me, in many cases the hectic and jerky camera movement seemed to be only a poor attempt to mask fact that there is nothing (or not much) happening, but it tries to make it look intense and action packed regardless. So cheap...and apart from pissing me off, it didn't work at all, but I admit I well may be a minority... The story feels like it is hanging in the air. Again, I didn't read the books so the scenes may have been adequately set there, but in the movie you get 10 lines, and off you go...and it doesn't add much depth later on either. The most fundamental question remained: what's the point? Sending 2 dozens of younglings to slaughter won't hold aggression at bay in itself, actually it is more likely that the infuriated parents driven mad from the grieving over the unnecessary and pointless death of their children will cry for revenge and go into resistance, or even spark a brutal bloodbath (especially that it is an annual event, so sooner or later everyone will be affected by friends or family). Also, the scale is hanging in the air too, you don't know how the 2 opposing populations (the \"citizens\" of the shiny new world and the habitants of the 12 district) relate to each other, which would be rather pivotal. I won't go on with the many potholes, the bottom line for me is that the scene was set simply poorly. The story, well, is very simple and straight, once you stepped over the inadequate surroundings. Feels painfully unfinished, and though I din't know there is a series behind, I told to the (rather disappointed) missus in the end that it must be so because they already have a sequel in mind. Knowing that gives a little excuse, but still left a hollow \"is this really it?\" kind of feeling in the both of us. The striking similarities with Battle Royal I'll leave alone... Acting was OK, considering the absurdity of some of the characters and the whole context (background and story). I'm sorry, I'm not a big fan of the lead actress (Jennifer Lawrence), as I didn't even know her before this movie (althogh I saw and really liked First Class, but somehow couldn't connect). Regardless, she does a good job of portraying and transferring the tension, fear and uncertainty of the situation she is pulled into, at least a good number of scenes, in fact her efforts were one of the few \"ups\" for me among the many \"downs\" during that long 2,5 hours. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks as well for creating a \"sugar-monster\" character, and also for the fact that though I know her face well enough (just seen in Man on the ledge), here I simply couldn't recognise :) Based on the movie itself, I really don't know how this can be so popular, but I admit I'm probably not the target audience, and also the books may be much better (well, it wouldn't be difficult as the bar is set really low). Donald Sutherland was brilliant saying \"only hope is stronger than fear\", but that and Ms Lawrence's occasional shine doesn't make this worth to sacrifice and evening for. I have a frequent visitor card so it didn't cost me anything, but if I've paid almost 10 quids for this, I would be rather upset...",
    "2": "Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick. Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better.",
    "3": "Three things first: (A)-Read the review and think about it first. (B)-I'm a guy! Haven't read the books, but I now want to. (C)-Please stop shouting 'Team Peeta/Gale, bitch' everywhere! In \"The Hunger Games\", a futuristic oppressive upper class society sets 24 children in a battle to fight against each other to the death every year. There are 12 districts and each district randomly selects one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 as tributes to enter the Hunger Games as a way to keep the districts in check and keep any signs of uprising at bay. The strong, sure-footed hunter, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), in a first of its kind, volunteers to be a tribute in place of her little sister in the games. The huge success of \"The Hunger Games\" should be attributed to the awesome marketing and the apparent title of being the next \"Twilight\" when it comes to its money making ability in the teen-fantasy genre. The camera-work is just fine, save for the jerk motions when somebody is being killed. You won't feel any nausea if you are used to Greengrass's style of cinematography. The acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson were great. Where the movie falls apart is in the second act when the contestants are inside the arena. Say what you may, at least \"Battle Royale\" provided a highly definitive motive for the kids to become killers, didn't glorify the regime and didn't hold back. Of course, since this movie is PG-13, there's relatively no bloodshed on screen and I can overlook that aspect. What kept nagging me throughout the whole movie is, the kids in \"The Hunger Games\" have no motive to kill each other! Sure somebody should win. But it never explains why they would pick up arms and go kill someone instead of letting nature run its course as Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy character explained earlier.The only ones with any kind of character development are Katniss and Peeta. All the others, save for the little black girl and Isabelle Fuhrman barely get to talk in the movie. We have the standard white hunk and his gang of cliché cronies who are the 'villains' and must be brought down. They smirk and take pleasure in killing others while our leads don't get their hands dirty, at all. Peeta, as far as we could see doesn't kill anybody while Katniss killed one guy in self defense trying to save the little black girl. Even the main 'villain' is killed off by cgi animals instead of our leads. So by the end of the movie, our leads are relatively guilt free and their actions in the arena doesn't affect them much. Also they never showed any of the parents being affected by watching their children kill others or being killed brutally. For a movie where 'hunger' is the main context, the children who come from ravaged, starved homes seem to adapt to the rich lifestyles quite quickly and they are barely starved even during the games. The social commentary completely fails in every aspect. Here we have a world that is like ours, which attempts to market every atrocious thing in a shiny package for the audiences. It was just touched upon and I felt like the writers were afraid of exploiting that storyline. They wanted to tell the story of a totalitarian regime, but ended up ditching it in favor of pleasing the masses. For all its talk of female empowerment, the movie panders to the audience who love Gale/Peeta including cheesy scenes which never come off as true. The Katniss we grew up liking in the movie wouldn't have kissed Peeta at that moment, unless of course it was a ploy to make the 'star-crossed lovers' notion work for the sponsors in the movie, which was never quite clear.I was in fact, highly excited to see \"The Hunger Games\". But in its attempt to appease the masses and thereby glossing over the disturbing (yet intriguing) social commentary, \"The Hunger Games\" does the most heinous act any movie could do. The system which we are supposed to loathe and be disgusted by, is cheered and celebrated by the movie by virtue of making the deaths of the children in the games inconsequential by making them caricatures and inserting a convoluted love story even in the most vicarious of situations, set to pander to the teens who will go weak in the knees and forget about the immoral world this movie is actually set in. By refusing to look directly at its own story and by instead fashioning a convenient morality out of its murderous sporting event, it lets the audience off the hook and even encourages them to enjoy the blood-sport as 'entertainment'.3/10",
    "4": "\"The Hunger Games\" is a film that I seem to have a higher opinion of than many people here. As a film buff (Particularly in the action and gangster genres), I am very familiar with quality chase films like \"Bullett\", \"North By Northwest\" and \"Westworld\" so I know a great chase when I see one. I really believe \"The Hunger Games\" is a modern classic that is well worth seeing. There are two things that really stand out to me. 1: Although the film (As well as the books, (That I did not read)), are targeted towards young adults, there are plenty of things in there (Fictional and non-fictional), that are very familiar to adults (Of which I am one). The fictional elements include: William Tell (The shooting of the apple in the pig's mouth), \"The Running Man\" (More on this later), \"The Most Dangerous Game\" (Particularly the scenes of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), having to live off the land and the sicking of dogs on her), \"The Lottery\" (The Shirley Jackson story is an obvious inspiration to the choosing of people from the various Districts to compete in \"The Hunger Games\", since with the exception of the overall winner, \"Winning\" the lottery is a negative,\"Total Drama Island\" and Greek Mythology. The Non-Fiction parts include: Joan of Arc (Katniss), Christ, \"Survivor\", The Olympic Games, Ancient Rome, France at the time of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI (Check out the costumes and gardens \"I remember seeing them in Mel Brooks \"History of The World Part I\")), and Nazi Germany. The other thing that stands out is the character of Katniss. There is a quote by Shakespeare: \" Be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.\" (12th Night). Katniss was born great (Unlike a lot of other teen heroes such as Peter Parker (Spiderman), or The \"Karate Kid\" who fit into those achievement or thrusting categories). Spoilers: If you go right to the beginning of the film, where she sneaks into another District to hunt, and where she becomes the 1st person in the 74 year History of \"The Hunger Games\" to volunteer after her sister Primrose (Willow Shields) was selected, you know she is someone to be reckoned with. As you learn about her, you see even more how special she is. For example: When she shot the apple in the mouth of a pig, when \"Judges\" were having a party and not paying attention to her (She got the highest grade (11 out of 12) from the judges), and when Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her co-competitor from District 12, says: \"My family said, we may finally having a winner from District 12, and it is not me, it is you.\" Check out this great line from evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland):\" There are lots of underdogs in this world,\" he snaps, \"if you could really see them, you would not root for them either.\" (He knew she was dangerous, and a threat to the state). A much different scenario then with Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in \"The Running Man.\" (A film that had similar themes (A futuristic TV competition involving an innocent person and an oppressive government). Think about that: Arnie not considered as dangerous as a 16 year old girl? Well if you saw both films, you would know that Katniss had more obstacles to overcome then Ben ever did. Finally the scene with the flowers where she places them over Portia (Latarsha Rose) the little plant girl who saved her life, followed by the \"Love Sign\", shows compassion and decency, and the way she pays attention and learns things extremely quickly goes beyond what would expected from a 16th year old of her background (Which is in extreme poverty, and probably without an education). This is an extremely easy character to like, and to root for, and coupled with an intelligent script and lots of action, makes for a modern classic. 10/10 stars.",
    "5": "The start of the movie is so obvious, with a tiny little girl scared out of her wits who has no business being in the Hunger Games, most predictably the lead actresses little sister it was obvious she was going to take her place. Even more less surprising we find out that the boy going with her has a crush on her.On to 1 hour and 15 minutes of Woody Harrelson being not nearly believable enough as a crude alcoholic become soft hearted, a lot of senseless dinners, a lot of hype for the contestants we know nothing about, absolutely no politics or explanation of what the Hunger Games actually are or how it came about, and an awful underlying message sent out to viewers. \"Just be yourself, but do what everyone expects!\" Katniss went from being tough, to a weak and sleepy survivor.Are you bored yet? So, they get thrown out into the Hunger Games, there is absolutely no build up whatsoever. The only person you know is out there is Katniss and the boy who came with her. The rest of the contestants you don't know, hardly have a clue as to what they're capable of, most of them die at the start anyway. Katniss runs away from the initial slaughter, to take a nap. Then she takes more naps. At one point out of the blue she finds herself in the middle of fiery doom, with fireballs launching at her, she barely survives. Well, lucky for her, though we were never told. she has some sponsors save her, with the help of a silent montage of Woody Harrelson laughing with a bunch of poorly dressed somebodies. She gets saved with super healing medicine! She takes more naps.Later, we find out the boy who has a crush on her is teamed up with the last of the jerks, for some reason, in a game where only one survives, there are people who travel in groups. Okay? Why??? They make some pathetic attempts to kill her, then give up and sleep. Kat makes a new friend who seems to be the most resourceful, herbal expert. She tells her to dump a bunch of insects on them. Then while it takes forever for her to saw a tree limb off, we're told these are evil, dangerous insects that will kill you. How convenient! She gets stung a few times, and conveniently kills a girl with the bow and arrows, which just so happens she's an expert with. How lucky! Too bad she was stung by these insects, now she's going to take more naps and be saved somehow... by a tiny girl who knows herbal remedies. Wish we would have known that! They turn out to be good pals, what a surprise that is. Well, after a lot more boring stuff of not getting to know anything about what is going on, they randomly decide to go find out what the meanies are up to.Turns out, they gathered all the supplies and somehow found a bunch of land mines to surround the pile. Okay? What's that supposed to do? Apparently, some girl isn't part of their group, she expertly dodges every land mine and gets away with something. So, instead of gathering some supplies, Katniss blows it all up. Then... runs away! Katniss and her little pal find each other, but get attacked, Kat swiftly dodges a spear throw, and sticks the attacker with an arrow. The attacker dies instantly. But finds out poor little girl was stuck by the big spear. Except it takes FOREVER for her to die, we don't know anything about this character, so we don't care, so the long drawn out death is stupid.Well, Kat runs off alone and finds her boy who has a crush on her. For some reason untold he's not with the group anymore and he's badly injured somehow. Okay, they hobble off after way too long, and then find a cave where it takes way too long for them to get things going. She decides to go off on her own for some supplies, and gets attacked by a girl who takes too long to kill her, but some other guy out of the blue SAVES Katniss... for absolutely NO reason, and then... just leaves her alone! In a game where only one survives, with the perfect opportunity to turn the odds in his favor... just leaves her alone! She goes back, takes a lot more time, and finds out there is only one person left? Really? Thanks for showing us some of the action... but anyway they leave the cave, and the Hunger Game... techs, or IT people or whatever they are, unleash a bunch of dogs that are really big and full of muscle. Kat and her boyfriend OUTRUN all of them to a huge metal platform where they're surrounded by blood thirsty animals... who could easily make the jump to the top of the platform... don't. Instead the last guy, whoever he is, is bloody and looks like he can barely move, beats the crap out of both of them. How he got by the dogs is beyond me... but whoever can do that must be amazing, until, Kat shoots him in the hand with an arrow. This causes him to fall off and get eaten by dogs. But Kat feels sorry for him, and puts him out of his misery.After this, there is nothing really to note. Nobody says anything important and nobody cares, they just wish it would end, because they don't really know what happened at all. They don't really know anybody but Kat, Donald Sutherland gives some meaningless scornful look, and walks off and the credits roll.",
    "6": "I've never read the books but went to an afternoon screening to see what the fuss was about. \"The Hunger Games\" I felt was a complete bore. The story unwinds in an excruciatingly slow manner and you really have no emotional connection with the characters. The plot-line itself---people of a dystopian future being made to fight to the death on TV has been done to death (no pun) and done with more wit an imagination in \"The Running Man\" for instance. The gladiator story is told much better in real gladiator movies like \"Gladiator\" and \"Spartacus\" which are both hugely better than \"The Hunger Games\".For an action movie it feels like days go by before there is any real action. The \"name\" actors like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland seem to be as bored as the viewer is with this material. The unknown actors playing the competitors are wooden. When there is action it is usually with such herky-jerky camera work that you can barely follow what is happening. And there are some gaping plot holes. SPOILER ALERT the heroine is treed by the others who will just wait her out to get hungry and come down. And of course they snooze instead. The \"simulated\" monster animals that can actually devour people? Most of the competitors are killed off camera? Come on. . .",
    "7": "What a bitter disappointment! In order to explain what is missing from the film, please allow me to describe what I love about the books.Suzanne Collins creates a moving portrayal of a girl living under a cruel dictatorship. Set against a background of extreme poverty, these books show how the unequal distribution of wealth affects Panem's society. Those living in the wealthy Capitol have so little in common with the destitute people from the Districts that they regard the deaths of District children as entertainment. The violence in The Hunger Games is shocking because it is brutal and unnecessary, yet wholly embraced- even celebrated- by Capitol residents. As for the District tributes, they are not enemies but they kill each other all the same, some reluctantly and others with enthusiasm. As the trilogy progresses, it becomes a compelling commentary on the madness of war and the sad futility of violence. However, these themes are woven into the books in such a way that you may not even notice they're being discussed. You become so immersed in Katniss's world that poverty is a given, and violence a sad but expected part of life.The film follows the basic storyline but lacks emotional depth. The character development is almost nonexistent and the deaths in the arena are bloodless in every sense of the word. The tributes are little more than walking stereotypes so their deaths have no impact. Even Rue's death- heart-wrenching in the book- is little more than a side note in the movie. If I hadn't read the books, I don't think I would have understood the dynamic between the tributes at all, including the conflicted relationship between Katniss and Peeta. Their romance comes across as cheesy and unconvincing. There is no hint of the bond that grows between them as the story progresses.Perhaps my biggest criticism of this movie is that no one seems to be going hungry! I cannot believe the filmmakers overlooked this important point. The Capitol's exploitation of the Districts is supposed to be the backdrop for the entire story. When Katniss arrives in the Capitol and observes how food appears at a touch of a button, she cannot understand how Capitol residents fill their time. The majority of her days are consumed with feeding her family. It defines her. Most of the tributes have never had enough to eat and this is a major factor in the Games.The beginning of the movie seemed promising. The ominous mood in District 12 was just right. It is apparent that the people who live there are exhausted and resigned to their fate. When residents appear for the reaping, they look like cattle being rounded up for slaughter. The Capitol, in contrast, is frightening in it's frenetic artificiality. This juxtaposition was well-done. However, the filmmakers lost me when the tributes entered the arena.There was no sense of tension. The tributes make all kinds of noise as they move through the woods, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they are being hunted. Katniss stands about ten feet away from Cato as he snaps a boys neck and we are supposed to believe he doesn't see her? The scenes from the control room are pointless and add nothing to the movie. They should have spent that time on character development! Unfortunately, this lack of character development causes the emotional scenes to fall flat. I am astounded this was even possible, given the subject matter, but the overall result lacks intensity and depth.I will credit Elizabeth Banks with an excellent portrayal of Effie Trinket. She adds humor and a sense of the absurdity of Capitol life. Donald Sutherland also does well as President Snow. Jennifer Lawrence is an adequate Katniss but Josh Hutcherson is terrible as Peeta. He's just not very likable. We see none of his inner strength. Instead, he comes across and whiny and weak. And Wes Bentley seems to be included just to showcase his ability to grow an amazing beard.One more thing. What happened to Haymitch?! He's supposed to be a self-destructive drunk! His cunning is all the more unexpected because he seems incapable of taking care of himself. I was thrilled when they cast Woody Harrelson and he does well in some parts but it seemed like they had to water down his character to market it to young adults.This movie had a lot of potential but it fell short in many important ways. A score of 3/10 is pretty harsh but I felt as though the filmmakers kept all of the plot points and none of the meaning. Read the books instead.",
    "8": "If you are going to make a movie about children being forced to kill each other for the enjoyment of the public, I would think that the tone one would reach for would be something more along the lines of Shindler's List or at least a tone of some satirical value. And you would think that the angst, fear, disgust and overall awfulness for the main characters would be a focal point. You would think the blood lust of the watching masses would form a visceral sense of at least moderate horror that would serve as a backdrop to all of this. And most of all you would think that children, even children raised to expect that they might someday have to enter a tournament like this, would struggle with a conflict between fear, innocence, longing for some sense of decency and trying to sort through the confusion to survive. It is something of a stretch to imagine a society in which everyone loves seeing children murder each other. That in itself is a plot line the brings a distorted feeling with it. The movie tries to hide that, or at least neglects to even attempt to address that, by layering this movie in and American Idol feeling. There is no sense of outrage. There is hardly a whiff of the sense of all of this in the time we spend with the characters. They are wooden and whitewashed. The most we get in the way of a sense of their overarching dilemma is a few shallow feeling comments and silent looks of stoic concern. The movie seems to present the material in this fashion to make us forget that we are watching children kill each other. It is as though we are watching running man - only with 8 year olds. Who doesn't want to watch a movie where adorable little boys and girls snap each other necks? Or dogs run them down and eat them alive...?If a movie like this is to be done it cannot avoid the moral content without seeming shallow and absently depraved. That is this movie. The core is not attempted. It is like red tails meets running man. I found it absent, vapid and obviously lacking in any real value. It was also a little sick because it didn't even bother for tone whilst presenting the viewer with a mind bending plot. In short, wooden acting, shallow presentation and not at all smart.",
    "9": "Many have drawn a comparison between \"The hunger games\" and Japanese cult movie \"Battle Royale\". There are obviously similarities, but even more pronounced differences. The best example is the universal graphic violence in BR. In THG, if you observe closely enough, the two protagonists are never directly involved in the executing of killing of the other 22 participants in the \"game\". They are not lily-white innocent, not by any means. But this watering down is intentional. Even with the protagonist aside, the more gory part of the killing is shown only once, at the beginning of the game, through a series of montages with visual images so fleeting that they hardly register. One other point that is emphasized (by an instructor to the protagonists) is that this game is not so much about killing as about surviving. He even quotes statistics – 30 per cent dies of dehydration or exposure, paying too much attention to their knives and not enough to their water supply.Set in a futuristic US when the hub around New York dominates and rules, 12 ruthlessly governed districts each provide two \"tributes\" annually to take part in a brutal survival game from which only one winner is allowed to emerge alive. There is a stark contrast between the ultra-modern, high-tech game design and control rooms and the primitive forest that is the playground. The movie is roughly in two halves. The slightly shorter (about an hour) first half establishing the scene and the second half concentrates on the titular event. The much contested lead role, by three Oscar-nominated young ladies, finally went to Jennifer Lawrence (\"Winter bones\") who edged Hailee Steinfeld (\"True grit\") and Shailene Woodley (\"The descendants\"), which seems logical as her Oscar nominee was for Best Actress while the other two's were Best Supporting Actress. And she does prove her worth with a solid performance. In the male lead (which is really a supporting role) is Josh Hutcherson whom I remember favourably from \"The kids are alright\" (2010). Adding pleasure to the movie are appearances in somewhat caricature-like roles by worthy actors like Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson and Toby Jones. Donald Sutherland's appearance is more like a cameo.\"The Hunger Games\" is good entertainment, with a reasonably engaging story. Recommended.",
    "10": "In the future all wars have ended, but famine and poverty still remain in a new North Amercia, which has been split into 12 Districts. To appease the people, and pay tribute to the fallen, Capitol City have devised The Hunger Games, in which 2 children from each District are chosen to fight to the death live on TV.The film follows the fortunes of the two chosen from District 12, and we see them whisked off to Capitol City - a pastel coloured \"Willy Wonka\" style place in which the people wear outlandish costumes, have bizarre haircuts and live seemingly empty and decedent lives. Here they are treated like royalty, and trained in readiness for the games.Eventually the children are pitted against each other and the game begin. It is here that the film begins to remind one of the Japanese classic of a few years back 'Battle Royale' - but without as much blood or violence. As the game progresses the rules begin to change to attain an ending which is pleasing to the masses, rather than those \"playing\" the game, and new elements are thrown in to ensure excitement and \"fun\" for the viewers.The film takes a long time to really hit its stride - the opening sequences seemingly go on forever - and there is no doubt that this film owes a big debt to 'Battle Royale', as well as nods to the original 'Rollerball' (in as much as war has been outlawed and violence has become controlled and organised for the entertainment of the masses) and even 'Logans Run', but it has enough in it to make it a stand-up, worthwhile film in its own right. Not the least of these is the way in which TV is shown to become cynical and exploitative, where - in much the same way as the Ancient Romans had their \"Blood and Circuses\" - love and death are merely elements in mass entertainment.The production is very good - the future Capitol City looks amazing - whilst the acting ranges from excellent (the young actress playing the lead role is very good), to screen chewing (Woody Harrleson eats his heart out!!). The other thing about the film is its length - at almost 2hours 30minutes there is no doubt that it is just too long! A good half hour could have been lost without losing any of the tension or drama. Worth seeing definitely, but make sure you watch it in a comfortable cinema (or else take a cushion!)",
    "11": "The trouble with this movie is that I'm old enough to have seen many of its antecedents. So before The Truman Show, which is essentially the same idea as The Hunger Games, we have Battle Royale, The Running Man and of course, Rollerball. They all deal with mass entertainment in a dystopian future society and they all have their flaws. What's really disappointing about The Hunger Games is that unless you've read the book, the film will give you only a fleeting glimpse into why the games are called that. There's nothing else to help the naive reader make sense of the plot and because of this, the involvement of children will seem a bit odd to anyone who hasn't read the book. In fact, that's something you should take into account when reading many of the reviews of the film as they're written by people who have read the books and can fill in the wide gaps in the film without even thinking about it. Some have said its plot line is mildy satirical, but in my view that's just an excuse for a poorly filleted and disappointing adaptation of a marvellous book.",
    "12": "To be honest, I was hesitant about this movie, mostly because it seemed like a new, toned-down version of Battle Royale. I had never read the books, but I feel that if a movie is good enough to inspire someone, then the book will be good enough to be read.I want to read the books.I didn't care for the shaky cam, especially in the beginning, but that's a personal preference of mine. I was highly disturbed that there was a world where children would be allowed to kill each other for sport. I kept wondering \"Who would let this happen? Why are their people cheering for these children's deaths and not mourning them?\" Rue's death satisfied that question. That was the most beautiful scene in the entire movie. Her death struck a chord with Katniss, an entire district and me. It was wonderful to finally see someone raging at the death of one of these kids, and she was the perfect vessel for it.The lovey dovey stuff was to be expected, but this movie didn't try to shove it down your throat like a certain sparkling vampire movie did. It was subtle, and not even something of assurance, but sweet.Just watch the movie. That's all I can say. I'm gonna go read the first book of the series. That's how good this movie is. It inspires the viewer to read and I'm ready for the next installment",
    "13": "The movie is so bad I cannot even decide what to pick to begin with. Everything was wrong in it. Possibly one thing was good in the movie - that it finally ended. Although I heard they plan to make a whole franchise out of it. Back to the bad sides - the film is nonsense in every aspect - the very idea of holding people under control by forcing their kids to kill each other? What the...? The Capitol so rich and so big, yet all its residents being free people. Where are all servants, all people who provide services? In districts? But hey, someone needs to clean those streets or polish toilets. In the film only people seen in the Capitol are gay-like citizens and soldiers. Next, premise is set as if the film is a teen flick. Yet, it has quite disturbing idea behind - teens killing each other in picturesque fashion. Another thing - couple of kids teaming up to kill other kids, while there could be only one winner (putting aside slight change just before the end with 2 possible winners). Also, acting of young actors is wooden as hell. Last thing that comes to my mind - advancement of the Capitol is sick - cameras in every tree and creating(?) beasts and whatnot with some fancy interfaces in headquarters...What the...? Where are boundaries of their capabilities? And yet they have mines... for coal? Really guys, I wish I hadn't spent my money for this crap.",
    "14": "I have read a TON of reviews that told us this is THE THRILLER, the revolution, the super amazing thing. Basically it is only huge victory of marketing over the common sense. To say that the Hunger Games is better than Battle Royale is the same as to say that Coca Cola is better than the best French Champagne, because the Coca Cola sells more bottles and it is better known around the world. Oh, this power of marketing that sells water with sugar and forces the masses think that it is mana directly from the heavens! To say it simply and honestly: The Hunger Games is huge failure. It is super boring nonsense that tries to play emotional, sad or whatever. It is thriller written by the worst author of the love books you can ever imagine. It is movie where the only real thrill is a bunch of silly costumes of the Capitol People. But even they do look as a collection of weirdos from very cheap music video from 80ties.I loved Battle Royale for its roughness, political message and pure shock value. There is nothing like that, when there is the first combat scene, it fails miserably. You can basically see only shaking camera. Then there is another long boring part, then again some super short combat messed again by another shaky camera. Then some hallucinations, then some memories, then some other boring sequence. There is a lot of similar movies (TV show that will be survived only by the sole victor) and every single of them is more thrilling. The only thing that would make the movie even more unbearable would be Sandra Bullock in the leading role.The Hunger Games is a joke, it is less thrilling that any Harry Potter movie. It is basically movie for kids dressed as a thriller. It is definitely not recommended for anyone ho seeks real thriller or really powerful movie. But again: If you are twelve it might be fine for you. The leading actress is pretty so you may be happy just to observe her in various dresses and enjoy when she runs around the woods. There is a bit of tears, flower gathering and shallow morale for these teenage girls who may like this Hunting Barbie kind of stuff. As a male I have suffered horribly however.One extra point for silly costumes and crazy haircuts. This is probably the only shocking thing in the whole movie.",
    "15": "It goes unsaid that the book is almost always better than the film. This movie is unique in the fact that it is much worse than the book. I'm not a fan of the latest fad of teen literature to begin with, but being a science fiction fan and a lover of the movie Battle Royale, I had high hopes for this. The word \"hype\" doesn't even begin to summarize how much attention and praise this movie has received, and it definitely did not deliver. The lead actress was great and the idea of a bleak future landscape separated into districts to keep the population in check is a great story. But the film didn't tell that story well. We get only flashes of how or why this system game into place or what the \"hunger games\" purpose actually is. It was very slow, very predictable even if you hadn't read the book and had virtually no action. The fight scenes it did have were quick flashes that if combined total two or so minutes of the movie. And don't get me started on the awful CGI of the \"killer dogs\" at the end.",
    "16": "I do not know the book this movie is based on, but I sincerely hope that it is much better (and have been told that it is) than its adaptation. As it stands, the movie is a PG13 version of Battle Royale, with a hint of Running Man, a touch of Truman Show, minus any irony or humor, with a lot less gore (to keep it PG13 no doubt), and a lot more cheese.The one thing that might have set it apart from its many predecessors would have been the political and social background story which is hinted at in the brilliant but short performances of Tucci and Banks, but gets drowned out by the tedious, incoherent, and unconvincing attempts at action and cheesy teenage romance of the Twilight variety.Even though the \"action\" is clearly intended to carry the movie, given the amount of time devoted to it, it is largely vapid PG13-type stuff, where the heroine MacGyvers her way out of a tight corner by dropping a hive of waspy insects onto her assailants --- who, in spite of being in a fight for their lives, guard her, and themselves, by collectively taking a nap at the foot of the tree their opponent is trapped in. Common sense isn't the strength of any of the contestants, which gallivant unguardedly and noisily through woods they know to be full of people out to kill them, and spend quite a bit of time publicly (and noisily) emoting when disagreeable stuff happens. Gimmicks abound, many of which easily predictable as they are introduced hamfistedly one by one during the preparation and training phase.Movie making is a business, and much of the revenue comes from young people, and there is every reason to believe that this movie is successfully catering to their tastes and preferences. Unfortunately for the rest of us, this means that all the interesting commentary on our own lives and societies that the source material might have contained is only a small subtext to a teenage drama that has been done before, better, sharper, and more convincing. The scenes with Tucci (equipped with dental enhancements that accentuate everything he does) and Banks (also in magnificent costume) are the highlights of this film, degrading the main action to mere filler for the teens. Unfortunately, for more than two hours, that's just not enough.",
    "17": "Suzanne Collins must have a radical hatred for teenagers -- including her own, if any --- to have taken such pleasure in their slaughter; in this poisonous and absurd movie.\"The Hunger Games\" fails absolutely as a social commentary, since those of us awake and with functioning minds know Mankind did away with gladiators at the fall of the Roman Empire. Today's imperfect society certainly has its faults, but the society in this film is false and ridiculous. Even science fiction needs an element of truth to make it work.As bad as this movie is, they still have to cheat at the story. The whole idea of the games is having 24 teenagers killing each other; so why then do the game-masters send in a team of 4 computer generated leopards to help get the killing done? In contrast, the \"Twilight\" series is like Little Mary Sunshine. I see teenagers every day. They are not as bad as their parents' generation were as teens. Why then did they flock to this hateful movie to celebrate their own slaughter?",
    "18": "This is actually my first review here. I just have to say something about this movie. I was really excited to see it, because it sounded like such a good story and I've been hearing people talk about it all the time.First of all, I was bored to DEATH during this movie. The scenes seemed so long sometimes and everything in this movie sort of got me annoyed. Poor characters, lame and cheesy lines, stupid teenager love story - that I could not believe until the end because I thought she liked the other guy back in her town whatsoever - the cast was –well- was mediocre, battle scenes blurred, background of the plot was not explained properly(I did not read the books). I only caught a glimpse at why it's actually called 'hunger games'; however no one seemed to starve – EVER.I was looking forward to the battle scenes but they made them so quick and blurry and f*** up (sorry), that even those were boring and annoying. Also annoying: the 'hero' does not even make use of her 'strength' the bow thing but instead hides in trees and only kills people when she absolutely needs to - of course. It's a teenage movie and why should she kills someone? You don't kill people, kids - even if your life depends on it.I'm rambling because I am still so upset that I paid 10 euro to see this crappy movie. I enjoyed absolutely nothing about this movie and I don't understand why other people like it so much.So: do not go see this movie, if you haven't already. It's a waste of time.",
    "19": "Simply, many over the age of 18 read these books and loved them, and it wasn't because there was a girl, a boy, and another boy in a love story. It was about an awful political system where children faced to the death for their survival with awful paragraphs of cruel brutality. This is part of what made the book unique. The movie, was an attempt to draw a crowd like Twilight for money, and completely blurred out children killing each other to survive so that it could be made PG13. Ridiculous. Jennifer Lawerence is an AWESOME actress though, and she did a great job. Throughout the movie I was never convinced that she lived in district 12 nearly starving... or that Peeta was dying in the hunger games.. it was all very pretty and not anything like I imagined they would do with it. Oh well, maybe they'll remake a rated R version some day that adequately portrays the books theme.",
    "20": "Eerie reminiscence of the mankind's dark, psychopathic past (the Greek Minotaur, the roman's gladiators and the island of Capri, and most recently the drafting of youths into the Vietnam conflict) this movie takes place in the future where society pits male and female youths (a total of 24) selected from 12 districts against one another in a compelling, lethal cocktail of hide and seek, and musical chairs. This movie, like 1984, reflects man's insecurities whereby in the future, he gave up his power and control to the state in exchange for a state managed society. Subconsciously, this movie particularly strikes home to the males of the Vietnam generation who were selected to enter the war games in the jungles of Vietnam when they came of age (and later when it became a lottery system) much like the characters in the movie. And like in the movie, much of the battles in that war were filmed and televised.",
    "21": "Vastly over-rated movie - I really don't know what all the fuss was about. Clearly meant for teenagers: trite romance; contrived, hole- filled plot; Disney-style happy ending. (Though at 2 1/2 hours it is way too long for teenagers' concentration spans). However, as far as teen- oriented movies go, it is still better than Twilight, though that doesn't say much.Take out most of the first hour or so, as this was all just padding and didn't develop the characters or plot much; give it a more realistic, gritty feel and take out the Disney romance, sentimentality and ending and this could have been a decent movie. In its current form it is boring and crap.If you want a good, gritty, Last Person Standing / Survival of the Fittest -type movie, watch Battle Royale instead.",
    "22": "I heard this is the adaptation of Japanese movie'' Royal Battle'' but trust me, I have seen both of them, all I can say is, it's much more better than that one. That movie was just awful. I just love this one. Jenefer's simplicity yet sharp moves, cleverness make this one amazing. I was so into this movie, I don't know how those 2 hours + movie come to an end.",
    "23": "The movie was well made and pretty much followed the plot. Where it was necessary to carry a plot element but eliminate the character on whom the plot point centered in the book, they found a clever way to reroute that element to another character. There were a few things I was hoping to see that weren't there, but the movie is already 2.5 hours. All that said, however..... Dear Hollywood, shaky, hand-held cameras are dramatic and artistic and provide a gritty realism. ON THE OTHER HAND, shaky, hand-held cameras are annoying, distracting, occasionally nauseating, and do NOT provide the atmosphere you envisioned in your head. So stop it already. Steady Cams were invented for a reason. I will not see this movie again because of the bad camera work.",
    "24": "While the film is competently acted, almost everything else about it is atrocious. Since I haven't read the novels, I can't speak to the faithfulness in comparison with the source material, but for a book that supposed to be rather violent, the movie was very tame. My biggest complaint would be the shaky-camera work, which, while useful in creating a sense of intensity or confusion, is quite headache-inducing and more importantly, obscures the action. Among the positives were Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson, who I felt gave rather entertaining performances, and the lighter, more humorous bits of the film were more enjoyable to watch. In regards to the preparation for the Games, I take issue with the backdrop of the whole affair, as it reeks of so-called \"reality\" TV, which I despise. But overall, I felt like this movie was like a watered-down rip-off of Battle Royale, without half of the emotional depth and pretty much none of the visceral content.",
    "25": "I haven't read the book but my brother and wife both loved it. The trailers made it look like \"The Running Man\", so had it not been for them I would have had no interest in this whatsoever.Within the first ten minutes I thought the film was either directed by a woman or made for teen-aged girls based solely on the camera work and editing. The shots of Katniss were brief with shaky hand-held camera work, while the shots of Gale were needlessly long, smooth and drawn out. Also, I can't believe that a film with male audience in mind could ever make Elizabeth Banks ugly.Katniss decides to volunteer to be a \"tribute\" so her little sister does not have to. They made it seem like being a tribute was a really bad thing, but didn't really give much explanation as to what it meant which really weakened what is a pretty central story point. Maybe they just assumed people would go in knowing that being a tribute meant being pitted in a mortal battle with peers, but it only took me one sentence to explain it, so they should have been able to find a way to squeeze it in.So Katniss and Peeta are named as the tributes for their city -- which is called Sector 12. They are taken onto a train in a scene that is filmed as though they are prisoners being taken into a concentration camp, the only problem here is that the train is filled with lots of fancy food and luxury (something seldom found in concentration camps). So the film style tended to tell us contradicting things.Peeta and Katniss arrive in a city full of weirdos that immediately made me think they were now in the land of OZ. Katniss then had a scrub-down which only reinforced the Wizard of Oz parallels in my mind. I'm all for homages, but they have to be subtle or they come off looking like a rip off, such as in this case.The next part of the film is probably the hardest to sit through as it is a long, dry series of sequences where the tributes from the various sectors are interviewed and trained in preparation for the games. What makes this more frustrating is that the film skips over all of Peeta and Katniss's competitors. If the filmmakers thought they couldn't do it properly they shouldn't have attempted it at all. They did find time to waste with Katniss's farewells to the new friends she made (which also wreaked of Dorothy's farewell to her friends in Oz).Now the games begin, and being a sucker for action movies I was really hopeful that this would turn the film around. Actually it did get better from this point on, but there was one major flaw that became apparent very quickly: The filmmakers were trying to make a PG-13 film about mass slaughter.What that meant in this case was using annoyingly shaky hand-held camera work to try to camouflage the violence. It didn't make it intense or interesting, it just felt like another cop-out.One by one the secondary characters die off while the world watches. One thing that did bother me a bit was when Katniss dropped a nest of wasps on a bunch of unwitting people below. It bothered me for a couple reasons: one was that these killer wasps didn't seem to affect Peeta, who was with the group below, and also because it's a well known fact that wasps will fly up... so the only thing that should've happened is that they would fly up and sting Katniss unmercifully.Katniss befriends a young girl who reminds her of her little sister, but inevitably the young girl is knocked off. This leads to a bit of a rebellion in the young girl's home sector, which is, from what I know of the story, a precursor of future events. The rebellion scene was actually the one moment in the film where the story shone through and became easily the best scene of the film.Katniss and Peeta team up for the final leg of the film and eventually outwit the game's creators by attempting a Romeo and Juliette type scheme of poisoning themselves. It's a little convoluted, but for some reason the show's brass seems to think that if these two both die they will beat them at their own game. Personally I'd let them die and then laugh.So Peeta and Katniss are now global celebrities, which is another point that is not really clear... why would you make these peasants that you hate so much that you make their children fight to the death celebrities? Anyway, Gale, who has been watching the whole Peeta and Katniss romance blossom on television turns up and there is a hint given that Katniss is actually more interested in Gale... so what concerns me now, is that not only have these filmmakers savaged what was a pretty good story, but they've also pointed the sequel in the direction of Twilight, and there are already too many of those films.I'm sure that some people who have already read the book(s) will enjoy seeing some of the things from coming to life, but I've always felt that the best adaptations make you want more, and a want to read the source material. This film did not do that for me, which is a bit of a shame because there are some good things in the story. If I were the author I'd be livid.",
    "26": "Directors who film using shaky-cam should be taken out and publicly horsewhipped. There is a reason steady-cam was invented, you morons!! I would have given this movie a 10 if it weren't for the fact that I couldn't watch half of it. I had to look at the back of the seat in front of me during the shaky-cam scenes, and of course, those were the best ones. As far as I could tell from what I could watch and from the dialog, the movie is quite true to the novel and the acting is very good. The scenery is quite lovely, as well - turns out it was shot in North Carolina, which means that's Appalachian country.Did I mention the director should be flogged for using shaky-cam?",
    "27": "First of, there is no option here to give ZERO rating, so I am going with 1/10. I generally have a look at the rating at IMDb and go to the movie. Seeing a rating of 9/10, I was convinced that this will be a movie to remember forever - likes of Harry Potter & LOTR franchises. I got what I expected for all the wrong the reason. I am a avid reader of books, but I didn't read the Hunger Games by Suzzanne Collins. May be the book is something else. The movie title is Hunger Games, but there is no hunger shown nor there is any games shown. 24 kids are picked for 12 districts in festival of 'games' where the contestants kill each other. Then the contestants go through a ritual of showing off their skills to get 'sponsorship'. Sponsorship means they could get help in the games. After nearly one hour of going nowhere with the story, the games starts. A bunch of contestants get killed in first 10 seconds. Every 10 minutes, another contestant gets killed. But this is a PG-13 movie isn't it, so the director is sensitive enough to not show any killings, instead indicating the contestant is dead by a loud bang and a holograph projector shows their picture in the sky. Dumb you think ?, read on...And by the evening, all the bad bullies of the remaining districts form a 'Alliance' and start hunting one particular girl-the heroin of this movie - WHY? I am sorry, I do not know. Read on...They find the girl quickly. The girl climbs a tree, but the bullies can neither climb the tree nor shoot a arrow or throw a knife. What do they do ?. they wait for the girl to climb down. Why don't they simply make a fire and burn the tree ? Well, I a not the writer nor the director....Point I am making is, this movie is SO DUMB, SO BORING. This is a 'B- GRADE' movie taken at huge expense, turning a R rated story into cheesy Teenage flick - but failing miserably in the attempt. By the time the movie ended, after 2hours 20 min, I was the first one out of the cinema hall, hoping for peace of mind.",
    "28": "So, after all the hype, I just watched The Hunger Games and really wasn't impressed.It's basically Battle Royale dumbed down for kids. You could clearly see the intent to hide anything that would take it over the 12A/15 certification. Hell even Speed had more verbal and physical violence and that was a 15.I found it boring. The majority of scenes were silence or dubbed over with gently epic music. And, throughout, I couldn't help but feel that the whole moral premise was on par with The Only Way is Essex (TOWIE); In order to be successful, you must pander to socially acceptable rules, the way you look and are perceived are the only factors important in your social acceptance not what you can do. Which, personally, I find disgusting.",
    "29": "First let me say, I love the books.Now let me voice my problems with the movie:Acting:Actors were good, I actually expected a worse performance. My problem was a lack of character development, they felt very flat, you don't link with the necessity of Katniss to win.Plot:They are called the HUNGER GAMES. They have to suffer, they have to fight for food, they have to kill each other. They made an R rated book a PG-13 movie and they expect it to work ? The fight had to be brutal like it was in the book, the tension of them moving in an arena that was trying to kill them didn't exist in the movie.The political implications you never understood them, you don't get that sense people in the other districts are linked in some way to the capitol, you don't sense people in the other districts has to suffer to great extents to find food. Development:The movie is freaking slow, I was failing sleep, mind you I finished the books in 18 hours non stop of reading. There are some useless scenes, others are too long and the important ones are too fast.Camera:Please kill the director and his stupid shaky camera, it was annoying. He failed to portrait the suffering of the participants, the action, the fights.I hope they do something for the next two or else I wont watch them. They need a better director, screenplay and writer.",
    "30": "It is not a series to be understood from the other movie of the series first. I can not say that I like Jennifer Lawrence and I like her acting. But it could be a good athlete. It is quite obvious that the author is inspired by which films, books and ideas.\nI like the world so much. It was a fluent film that could be watched with excitement.\nIt was a film that had remarkable characters but did not smile at the pros. The stereotypes did not sink. This is a series I like.",
    "31": "With The Hunger Games being one of my favorite (young adult) books ever, I pretty much hesitated to go to the first screening of the movie. In the end curiosity won and I did go and regretted it.It's not that The Hunger Games is a bad movie. It isn't. It's actually a good, exciting and very entertaining one. But the ending let me down in a big way. And that puts a big (negative) mark on the overall experience.I think Lionsgate did almost everything right with this movie adaptation. I love Gary Ross as a filmmaker. He wrote Big, Pleasantville and Dave and directed two of them. I love Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, Lenny Kravitz as Cinna and especially Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. When I read the book I even had Hutcherson in mind for that role, so casting director: well done! To avoid an inconvenient rating Ross uses a lot of shaky camera-work. This gives you some headache in the beginning of the film but once the action moves to the arena it works out fine. You hardly see any violence but you know it's there. Smart move. Ross also makes more use of presenter Caesar Flickerman (than in the book). He watches the action in the arena and gives his comments. He also explains (to the viewer) why certain situations are dangerous for the Tributes, making the stakes more understandable. Unfortunately Ross uses this trick one or two times too many. Great use of music and the singing of the Mockingjay birds is also very well done. Ross also uses some elements of books 2 and 3 to give the viewer a hint at what lays ahead. For instance there is more president Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the film than in the book. He sees that Katniss can be a thread. The reason why suddenly two Tributes are allowed to win The Hunger Games is even better explained in the movie than in the book. And we also see the first uprisings in district 12 after the death of one of Katniss's friends. That's a moving scene. For all this Ross uses a lot of screen time, more than two hours and twenty minutes, paying much respect to the book. Thanks for that!So what really let me down is the ending. That could have been more dramatic. The way Katniss survives The Hunger Games could use a lot more suspense (\"What the hell is she doing? What is she doing?!\") and the consequents that follow should have been more dark and menacing. That's a big miss. With The Hunger Games Gary Ross delivered a solid, well made and very entertaining movie that hopefully rockets both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson into stardom. But if you're a very very very big fan of the incredible first book – like me – you really should think twice before going. Because usually the best movie adaptations are made in your own mind.8/10",
    "32": "I want those 2 and a half hours back. I don't have words to describe quite how hard this movie sucks but I will try. Always best to start with a positive though so I will say this movie is probably twice as good as Twilight :) Now for the bad: 1) This movie is paper-light in terms of plot. Dystopian futures centred around class struggles have been done to death. They are not weighty backdrops with which to lend your stories depth.2) I really couldn't care less about the characters. About an hour in I wished they had all died.3) The socio-economic backdrop aside, the futuristic vision this film conveys is boring. Maybe that was the point and I am missing it.4) The premise is ridiculous and clearly Battle Royale and The Running Man had an ugly love child. I understand this film was based off a book series - I didn't know this before watching but even still after nearly 3 hours of my attention if you can't convey the alleged gravitas and merits of this story I am unlikely to be impressed with a deeper literary exploration of this shamelessly exploitative money-grab.5) Did I mention the plot was paper thin? 6)Any chance of something remotely interesting or 'edgy' in terms of the dynamics of the unlucky lot thrust into the grips of mortal combat was looked over in favour of the mainstream, pleasing approach. I can only imagine this was for reasons alluded to in point 4.7) The attempted conveyance of a romance in this film was plain ridiculous especially after this lengthy scene was played out straight after the equally ridiculous tragedy of the main characters little friend having just died.8) Maybe I fell asleep at times but I am pretty sure the only person to have benefited from a 'sponsors drop' was the main girl. I found this odd as much was made of this little rule in the build up and I was led to believe that sponsors would have 'favourites'. Seems they all loved her and hated everyone else.9) Related to above... Clearly any half decent sponsor would have air dropped a ladder in to the group trying to get her out of a tree.10) Even as an action film, this flick is nauseating. The 'set piece' fight at the end is lamentable and even then is tinged with the nasty soiling of poorly thought out emotional drivel.11) Having watched this film not more than an hour ago and having had it rob over 2 hours of my life I think it is still telling that I cannot remember the main characters names. Anyways, I will stop bashing this film now. Suffice to say I hated it. It's terrible - avoid it if you value half decent cinema. Avoid it if you are just after some cheap action thrills. By all means go watch if you need to test your threshold for boredom, cheesiness or sanity.",
    "33": "Hunger Games only feed my interesting even more, but this Gary Ross movie fails to make me full. The movie is based on the 2008 science fiction novel by Suzanne Collin, telling the story of teenager Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who lives in a post-apocalyptic nation of Panem AKA North America where The Capital, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation by having The Hunger Games, an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12–18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death. You probably asking why don't they rebel against this cruel matter. They can't kill everyone, they rebelled in the past, why not now. That is the idea. By the capital killing their children without remorse or second thought. They demoralize the districts and keep them down. Africa is absolutely ridden with child soldiers, so it's somewhat possible. I know it's bit unbelievable, but just go with it. The movie fails to also mention Avoxes from the novel, the people who rebel against the Capital anyways. I imagine District 9 would be frequent winners of these games. They have illegal aliens. Just joking. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katnis, but she does have some lacking values such as Lawerence gives near emotionless deliver of lines. Well that technique is commonly used to show uneasiness, tension, and stress. Sort of like from Katniss' POV, it's just not well-delivered. Not only that, but its hard to buy the fact that she is supposely 16, when she already start in more adult roles before this film. It's seem out of place. Katnis is chosen for Hunger Games with little to no training against well career tributes whom districts with a better economy since they had resources to train for the hunger games. She isn't going alone, she is follow by Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson) a short, boring one-dimension boy character. To make them have a chance of surviving, alcoholic trainer Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrison) is wanted them to fall in love, so they can get sponsors to help them with the game. What is missing the movie is Katniss's inner monologue wrestling with the fact that she doesn't love Peeta, but has to. To show young love to become a audience favorite. The fumbled romance can actually be contextualized as two people being manipulated into this awkward thing they think is romantic love but really isn't, because it's what fans both in the novel and outside the novel want. It hurts the film. The story, especially the movie, works best as a scathing satire of reality television, but the absurdly shaky camera, especially in the fight scenes was annoying as hell. If they're trying to set a frenetic tone to simulate actual fighting their doing it wrong. The movie does a fantastic job of depicting the ignorant high classes with the capital civilians with awful clothing. The people of the capital see these children as characters on a screen and even when they don't they won't blame the government for bringing them there, they will blame the other child for killing him/her. It's interesting in a way, because in real life, people pay to see movie just with the fact that children are killing other children. We don't blame society, we blame the child. Truly eye opening subject here. Another thing, Hunger Games fail to show us hunger. It's not presented in the movie well enough. Most of the actors looks well-fed. In a world, where they can create animals like wolf mutts, why couldn't they create animals to be eaten? Doesn't matter anyways, cause the bad CGI makes them look fake, even the fire dress looks fake. The music by Taylor Swift 'Safe and Sound' and the soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazing. The PG-13 rating didn't really hurt the film, as most of the death were pretty gruesome, and some of them were really emotional such as the death of a member of District 11. I hated the fact that the movie wrote out several really important plot points like Katniss having to adapt to going deaf halfway through and Peeta thinking his leg might be cut off. I think it's importation to the plot. Also, part of the appeal with the world building was the inter-district politics which play such a huge role in the sequels missing here.The books are original enough that you don't notice how the basic story structure is shamelessly pillaged from Running Man and Battle Royale. Everyone is saying it's a copy of Battle Royal, what about \"Knights of forty islands\". The first novel by Sergey Lukianenko in 1990? 6 Years before, Battle Royale was finish. The story is very similar. Just because something came out second doesn't always mean its a rip off. Similar ideas are always going to be around. Besides, the Hunger Games focuses more the the 'glamorized' idea of the games. The author took the premise of our reality TV shows and went far right with it. Never really got why the Hunger Games seemed to be linked to Twilight. Other than the love triangle and conflicting emotions of a female main character, there were no real similarities and let's be honest here: the Hunger Games was just better than that pathetic portrayal of vampires in all aspects. At less here, the female lead is a free independent string woman unlike Bella. The movie is not as good as the book, but that's because the book is written in first person, with a lot of detail and plot points derived from Katniss' personal thoughts. This could not be translated into a movie seriously (I would have hated hearing her narrate it) so other methods had to be used. The movie work as what it can do, and that's really good enough.",
    "34": "'The Hunger Games' is an amalgamation of many films and TV shows we've seen before. For starters, the long-running reality show 'Survivor' comes to mind as a good part of the film is set in the forest where the characters must rely on survival skills to survive. The film's premise, in which children and teens between the ages of 12 and 18 must fight to the death as part of a televised spectacle, is reminiscent of 1998's 'The Truman Show', where Jim Carrey's entire life is put under the microscope of a reality show, broadcast to millions.The setting of Hunger Games is a post-apocalyptic dystopian future similar to the 2010 British film, 'Never Let Me Go'. Both films posit a future where a society of mindless, brainwashed automatons are unable to rebel against a totalitarian system that calls for deathly self-sacrifice of the young. With all the characters adopting such a one note conformity, there's very little wiggle room for any kind of interesting drama in the film, which relies more on the cheap thrill of watching teenagers attempt to do themselves in vis-a-vis mortal combat.The rulers of the post-apocalyptic country we're introduced to, 'Panem', are more like unpleasant fops from an 18th Century Louis VI French court than the ineffectual pacifists of the 1993 sci-fi satire, 'Demolition Man', starring Sandra Bullock. And our 'common folk' protagonists 'Katniss' and 'Peeta', from 'District 12', remind us of an Appalachian setting, similar to scenes from 'Winter's Bone', the same film in which the Hunger Games' star, Jennifer Lawrence, was nominated for a Best Actress Academy award.The Hunger Games takes an interminably long time before we get to the meat of the story. The reason for this is that the film's scenarist, Suzanne Collins, seeks to extract as many tears as possible from her teenage audience, by dwelling on the victimization on the protagonist's younger sister, Primrose, and Katniss' sacrifice, when she volunteers to take her place as part of the Hunger Games. Can the cold-hearted leaders at the 'Capitol' be stand-ins for parents in general, as the 'kids' appear to be completely at the mercy of adults who hypocritically claim to be acting beneficently on their behalf.The Hunger Games won't begin until we're treated to the next long-winded sequence where the principals are introduced to the public via the big media broadcast. The criticism of the media here seems to be all too obvious but Stanley Tucci is effective as the foppish master of ceremonies. Like many of the 'twists' throughout Hunger Games, Kantniss' dress catching on fire during her TV interview, hardly seems fantastic at all. If you want better 'magic', check out any Harry Potter flick instead! Finally, we get to the meat and potatoes of the film--the fight to the death between the kids. One immediately thinks of a futuristic 'Lord of the Flies' here. Interestingly enough, director Gary Ross's herky-jerky style prevents us from really experiencing the full import of the violence. On one hand, that's commendable since the film's basic premise is wholly unappetizing. On the other hand, it prevents the film from being suspenseful, as the violence doesn't seem real, suggesting that these characters are also not real people.Hunger Games finally morphs into a completely dopey and comical spectacle as the teenagers (aided by the surly establishment) attempt to do one another in. As the games begin, the kids begin hacking each other with machetes. The rest of it is completely derivative including a dull computer-generated fire, a wasp nest falling from a tree, booby-trap explosions, more computer-generated nonsense (a pack of gnarling hounds), poisonous berries and a fight to the death on top of a weird sculpture called 'Cornucopia'.If this isn't ridiculous enough, at a certain point, the powers that be declare that there can now be two survivors, provided they're from the same district. This turns out to be a ruse and the new rule is rescinded which lead the protagonists to threaten mutual suicide. Although the bulk of the people are depicted as enjoying the spectacle of the mass killings at the beginning, the authorities now fear that a mutual suicide may cause unrest in the districts. Hence, the basic rules are changed, and now two are allowed to survive, instead of one.As Jennifer Lawrence appears to have signed on for three more Hunger Games sequels, she'll probably be set financially for life. Whether her overall reputation will survive after acting in such drivel, remains to be seen.The Hunger Games is really designed for young teenagers and older, less sophisticated teens who have little interest in reading anything resembling what any reasonably educated adult may refer to as 'literature'. It's a film that's mostly devoid of 'ideas' and appeals to devotees of soap operas, who always seem to end up entranced with one-dimensional villains and heroes or heroines, that inevitably end up on elevated pedestals!",
    "35": "A grand historical picture rolls out slowly, war, slavery, resistance, has already had an epic meaning.",
    "36": "I knew hardly anything about the title before watching last night but I soon realised that it had to be an adaptation of a teen novel. It was the only way I could justify all the waffle and time wasting that went on. Nearly an hour passed before we even got a sniff of action and even then it was far more interesting in Running Man & Battle Royale.The plot holes gaped and the acting was wooden for the most part - Woody Harrelson was the stand out but that's not saying much.We ended up forwarding through swathes of the film just to try and find something interesting - we failed.Very poor and I hope the book is better or it shows a lack of class from the readership.",
    "37": "Alright, I'm going to be honest. I thought this film was going to be terrible. I really did. I've read all the books, and I thought they were okay, but not really worth all the hype. Then I saw the film, and I was blown away. This was one of the best films of 2012, and I cannot wait for the sequels to come out, although I am a little upset that they're splitting Mockingjay into two films! Oh, and by the way, there is a film just like this one; it came out 10 years ago, was called Battle Royale, and it was better than this, even though this film was excellent.The film takes place in a dystopia future, where the world was destroyed by an unknown event. The area that survived, now called Panem (North America), is now split into 12 districts, all ruled by The Capitol. We find out that the districts attempted to overthrow the capital, but they were defeated, resulting in the destruction of District 13. Now, for the past 74 years, two citizens of each district; a boy and a girl, all between the ages of 12 and 18, are sent to die in a tournament called the Hunger Games. The last person standing receives a lifetime of fame and fortune, and the district reaps the benefits. This film follows 16-year old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) of District 12, an expert archer, who volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the games. Her partner, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), is a baker, and they come with a strategy of pretending to fall in love with each other in order to look good and get help from the outside world during the games. They are guided by Haymitch (a great Woody Harrelson), a drunkard who is the only surviving winner from District 12 (only two from the district have ever won). They head for the Capital, and are trained, and they meet the other tributes. Here is the movie's biggest flaw; most of these characters actually had bigger parts in the book. Here, they run around and get killed off. Only Rue from District 11 is given any substantial screen time, but it's still not enough. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is the wicked leader of the totalitarian Capital, and he doesn't want District 12 to win, because it results in the poorer districts (9, 10, 11, 12), to stand up and want to rebel again. The games are overseen by Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) and the Gamemakers, who add new obstacles in order to make the games exciting. Those two were barely in the first book, so their larger part in this film is very welcome. Eventually, our two heroes work together to try and win, and I won't spoil anything else. This was a very well done film. The actors are great, especially Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna. The effects are all well done, and the cinematography, which I heard people didn't like, is also pretty good. Director Gary Ross (who sadly isn't directing the next film) did a great job translating the book to the big screen, and it was a success. Hope the sequels are as good as this. \"May the odds ever be in your favor\".Final Verdict: 8/10",
    "38": "Alright, where to begin... I hate the Hunger Games franchise. The books are boring and disgusting garbage, so one day I watched the film to see if there was any improvement... nope, not a bit. It was just a melodramatic rather ugly-looking girl murdering other kids for an hour. The movie should be titled, \"Two hours of my life I'll never get back\". If you like the dystopian genre, try Soylent Green, that's a much better movie with a real story and a truly amazing film. I had a nice, big bonfire last week and burned all the DVD's and books of this pathetic franchise I could find. It's an extremely overrated series, not very good, and I honestly wouldn't watch it again or read it if you payed me! Don't waste your time with this garbage, it really isn't worth it.",
    "39": "The hunger games is a wonderful film that is angaging from start to finish.I really enjoyed this film and what it had to offer.The action was done well even though the camera was shaky it still had that emotional grip during the action sequences.This film has the basic plot of battle royale young adults killing each other and thats it.The hunger games is sent up in a world were people watch all this violence in amusement and shock.The actiing from jennifer lawrence is to die for she gives a eye opening performance.Also josh hutcherson who was stuck in child actor nirvana for a while shines in this well.Woody harrelson and lenny kravitz did a fine job as well.Donald sutherland does a in the shadows performance.For a PG-13 film it is quite dark and grim especially when the action kicks in and when characters talk about the whole idea of the hunger games.If you want a brutal,sometimes jaw dropping but emotional experience watch the hunger games.",
    "40": "This movie is nice but highly overrated. I can tell you that the first 20 minutes are so/so the next 10-15min are no/no And the rest good except the ending. That about sums it all up. Maybe the only people giving this good ratings are kids and fans of the Book. I fell asleep after the first 20min and had to watch it the next day.Do your self a favor and wait for it on TV or something. Trust me you would not want to pay over 10 dollars and who knows how much on soda and popcorn for this.Hey give it a try. But I wouldn't pay full movie price or DVD price for it.",
    "41": "In a future dystopia named Panem there was once a civil war. Brother against brother , state against state , and , as always , one side won. They established a treaty known as the treaty of treason where every year there forth a male and female child from each of twelve districts would be chosen to fight to the death in combat with the last one standing made rich and famous.So we see the beginnings of the 74 th Hunger games.Primrose Everdeen is in her first year of reaping and she is certain she will be chosen.

The epitome of childish.",
    "42": "I don't know how being a super critic works but I do know one thing. This movie has not been reviewed fairly at all. You gotta look past the book okay movies that are based on book are going to be different from the film always because books are a bundle of words on a page. Unless your running time is 7 hours for the film naturally you have to cut and paste all I am saying to you hardcore book fans out there is be aware of that. Films and books are two completely different mediums. As for some reviews on this film I failed to see the Blair witch camera work relations at all. The movie was shot quite decently there it's an action film the camera needs to move around in order to bring the audience in if the camera just sat on a tripod you'd complain that the action got away from you. Great fight choreography well written story with some good direction. The cast was wonderful in their performances the only two thing that bugged me were the fact that glimmer died at all and the starship flying over head in the forest. All in all a decent ride.",
    "43": "What's seriously wrong with the reviewers/critics ? I mean seriously 9, 10/10 for this crap!Hunger games is an event of choosing 2 people from 12 districts and the 24 people so formed battle each other to have one winner. A shining example of homicide. The first half of the movie is very sluggish. It builds up , introduces various contestants and makes you hungry to see the battle.If you have tolerated this one till interval, your expectations are sore high for a mind-boggling 2nd half.But Alas...WHat happens is even worse.. There ain't any fights.. just a few knife/arrow shots and the contestants die like a pack of cards. The conclusion as we all know , our lead actress had to win with a comic twist in the middle to increase the TRP of the show ..Jenifer Lawrence does a great job trying to hold the movie together. The visuals are first- rate.The novelty of the plot can be appreciated but there can be no excuses for the poor execution.In short, avoid spending on this movie and enjoy games at your home.",
    "44": "Blame Twilight! Ever since Twilight came out, all these teen flicks have been a variation of Twilight. Hunger Games is no different, it's just Twilight with teenagers trying to kill each other, oh wait, it IS Twilight, minus werewolves and vampires. The cheesy predictability associated with these teen flicks is in check; in a dystopian future, annually a bunch of teens are pitted against each other in the titular event until only one of them is left standing, all in the name of entertainment. Hunger Games thinks it's smart and different, but I couldn't help thinking I've seen it all before, with young Japanese actors and actresses. Oh yes, I have! 2000's Battle Royale starring Takeshi 'Beat' Kitano. Royale did it way better though: the concept is more credible and in a way, more scary - the youth of Japan are out of control, so a program is introduced to discipline/punish (delete as appropriate) them; the youths are selected by high school class, they are sent to an undisclosed island where they are to kill each other until one is left. The catch? They're wearing explosive collars, any tampering with them will blow their heads off. Now, that's a much more effective concept! For Hunger Games the final nail in the coffin is when Woody Harrelson's Haymitch convinces Wes Bentley's character to give the rioting public something to root for - \"young love\"! I literally cringed and almost gagged when I saw that scene! Avoid, avoid, avoid! Watch Battle Royale instead, you'll be grateful that you did.",
    "45": "Having not seen Battle Royal or indeed read the Hunger Games books, I probably don't have the same scope for disappointment as others do. And judging it purely on it's own merits, it's certainly not the worst dystopian film I've seen in recent years.However, while I did like Jennifer Lawrence's performance, there isn't much else positive to say about this movie. Everything feels a bit rushed and unfinished- kind of like the final series of Game of Thrones. The screenplay is badly constructed and it doesn't allow the central characters to shine as it should. The depiction of futuristic aristocrats is highly unimaginative and the general setting and social structure is just far too unrealistic. This had the potential to be a masterpiece but the final result is just confused and ostentatious.",
    "46": "The movie is excellent. Jennifer Lawrence gives a wonderful performance and shines as Katniss. Woody Harleson was perfectly cast as Haymich. Katniss is a strong likable hero. She is manages to mix being strong,caring and distant with being vulnerable and caring. I loved the relationship between Katniss and her sister and also between Katniss and Rue.I like self deprecating/humorous characters. Pacey Witter is my favorite example of that. Twilight's Jacob has it, Damon from Vampire Dairies but for some reason it's not endearing with Peeta. He was blah to me and at times annoying.I am a romance nut but cringed at the peeta/katniss stuff. I like movies and books were the good guys live, win and have happily ever after. I don't get the sense I'll be happy by the end of this series but I'm rooting for Katniss and District 12.",
    "47": "The concept of being forced to fight for ones life meets Disney snow queen lead by a stoic, one expression does not suit all occasions. Mixed in with weird paternal miss matching and emo that never hits the mark. This film should never have been released. It is droll. Even the concept of winning and achieving, the human who survived, yadda , yadda, c'mon they were prisoners who were tortured and forced to fight each others. Extremely brutal mixed in with butterflies... this is sick. This film fails to entertain, is completely presumable, has poor acting and even less interesting and engaging story. This may be my 2012 droll.",
    "48": "I don't know a thing about the book, so I just gonna pretend its a movie. Pretty much through out the film I was thinking \"did the writers interact with humans at all?\" And I don't think so. The hole story has its forced sense, where characters and events happen in a not realistic way, with the purpose to get from A to B, and when they would conflict with the story they just go to non-existence. Like the riot in district 11, that is what would happen if the government how already treats people like slaves, would go \"Oh hey, I gonna take away from Your children and gonna slaughter them for no real good reason. But hey it will be fun.\" But in this movie this only happens so the story can progress forward, and once that it done its purpose it goes in to a non-existence stage.Than there are the evil 4, how teams up for what reason? they will need to kill each other anyway, so no real sense in that. And they keep loverboy as a pet \"Oh he's are best chance to found the hero\"... why? (to keep loverboy a life I guess) Than they found her, apparently none of them can clime tree's, they magically can't shoot the hero with bowl and knifes. Than they go, because loverboy how would be dead right there since he served his purpose, goes \"lets just wait till she comes down\" and they like \"okay\" Not that they could not shake the tree, or place a mine on it and trigger it. No. Lets just wait so that the hero can survive. Than they all go a sleep... really? they have a dude next to them how they cant really trust, a chick above them how the same, and other how runs around in the forest how might kill them, but how needs a guard, right? Than there's the bee hive, lets just forget that they probably make that much noise that our hero how is close to them would have realized \"oh bees\" on her own. But angry bees only infects one evil person, even though they stormed the 3 other mean person and loverboy but they get out just fine.Of course this is just the top of the ice berg, there are so many things wrong with this hole movie its impossible to write it down in this limited space. But to sum it up, its the classic case of lets keep the hero alive even though she should so die here, and here, and here. Oh well we just gonna make everybody else mindless, and react out of the character so there's a cheesie way to save her.",
    "49": "Although the movie was unlike the book in some ways, the movie blew me away. I bet many of these reviews would be much better if there was no book, although the book is amazing. I was left hanging when the games started, and even though the beginning was a little slow, it was very nice to see how Katniss changes throughout and how once quiet, now brave and strong. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Lenny Kravitz, Woody Harleson, Willow Shields, Liam Hensworth, Elizabeth Banks, Issabele Furman, Alexander Ludwig and the rest of the cast did an amazing job. But the person who stood out the most was Jennifer Lawrence. She did amazing acting and did as well as she did in the movie Winters Bone. If you want a good movie, get some money and go see The Hunger Games...my top movie.After all, The Hunger Games was a fresh piece of paper with outstanding never before seen drawings on it. This movie is worth the money.",
    "50": "This is just plain awful. The author took all the fun and sarcastic criticisms about our society out of the original \"Battle Royale\" that she copied off. The acting is okay, but the premise is now quite absurd. The suspension of disbelief is simply not there. The CG is also down right awful too - its very low budget CG that makes Xena from 1990s look 10 times better. The worst part is the pacing, which goes at a very slow and boring pace. I felt like I am watching silent movie with occasional action that doesn't really excite me.This movie is simply not worth a look. Complete and utter waste of time. Go watch the original \"Battle Royale\".",
    "51": "like everyone else, before going to the movies I stopped on IMDb and read a few criticisms of the film - both those with better than average grade, and worse. But I think it's finally time to wonder what is the purpose of this time consuming ritual. because when a little thought, in few years back, i found that just a couple of films is well characterized with the average grade on this site. but here, not only that I stopped with this habit, I decided to write my first review. for me like for many others with first reviews, trigger is terrible dissatisfaction with seen. I did not read the book nor did I know until yesterday that this film is another adaptation. for the book I do not know, but the movie turned out, on my sorrow, to be for children up to 14 years maximum - the magic of 21st century and advertising machinery. After the first few minutes of the film when you realize you're 28 year old who is stuck with teenage movie and after you realize what would not just the end, but everything, look like, you tell yourself: ''sit back and at least try to enjoy visual side of the movie''. but that too ceases to be an option once you realize that you are about throw up because some producer decided it was more fun instead of continuous motion of camera to record in the way: cut-ear, cut-leg, cut-tree in the background,cut-somebody runs, cut-Hair... and all that in 0.3 second and from different - all possible angles. must be seen to be believed. but even that is not the worst, because imagine what the feeling of nausea you get when you realize that the hour of the movie is spent to describe the characters and get nothing better then awful cliché: bad guys are trained, arrogant bullies that smile too much and of course despite the superhuman strength, arrogant like that, they must be kicked by the petite 16 year old shy girl. but since this is still a children's movie, you will not literally see bloody action scenes where this brave archer girl kills super-strong and skilled bullies, but you will rather see scenes where those skilled bullies can not figure out how to catch a girl who ran away from them to a tree, so they decide camp under a tree until this girl alone does not get hungry and climb down. but because it was cold, of course, the bullies get cold so they find it was smart thing to make a fire and warm themself, but not too close to tree as it could catch on fire and kill a girl they've been chasing to kill.:)To conclude, if you're not 14 year old teenager, this is not a movie for you. don't get yourself tricked like I did.cheers",
    "52": "When I heard that there's going to be a cinema release of \"The Hunger Games\", I was really excited (as many fans, really). Casting seemed kinda appropriate, even though not perfect. I believe they should cast actors of the age as represented in book, not any other. Beginning was ... okay. I guess. They drill us in by few slides of the basic explanations of everyone who hasn't read the books. However, everything from that on goes downhill. At least 80% of original scenes from the \"Tributes\" part of the book were either changed or left out completely. She buys the medallion on the market instead of being a gift from a friend. Peeta's father never visits her, giving her promise that he'll watch out for her sister. Haymitch is nowhere until the train scenes. I mean, his failure of drinking problem is NOWHERE NEAR AS POINTED OUT AS IN BOOKS. I like the actor they cast for him, Woody, my boy, but they just don't give him an opportunity. There's no chemistry between characters, actress who plays Kantiss is just staring here and there like a dead seal, without any acting whatsoever. Actor who plays Peeta might be even worse. There's simply no connection whatsoever between them, no chemistry - before or during the arena. For everyone who has read the books, Ru's death was one of the most emotional scenes in whole book. In movies they scavenged it to 30s scene without any emotion whatsoever. It's like watching that dude who died at the first step in arena being buried - no one cared! Jokes were plain, not well executed, Kantiss's absence of water was never portrayed (as if she instantly found the water), scenes in the cave were empty, without any emotion whatsoever, scene where Tresh spares Kantiss was plainly retarded as if he had the eyes over the arena and saw what she did for Ru ... I can't begin to describe the enormous burden I bared during the movie time. They almost destroyed the book for me. I can bet up my house that (if anyone ever decides to make it) this will be the easiest movie to make parody of (maybe just above Twilight) simply because they thought they can make it to look better in the books. They ruined great R+ books and dug them down to the PG+13. I mean, seriously? There's like three drops of blood in the entire movie. Main actress looks as if she ate her whole life ten meals a day, not starved for half of her life. She doesn't lose weight in arena, no, she actually gains it. I can go on and on about the flaws of the movie, but I think this is enough. I'm just hoping someone will remake it in the future and make it ACTUALLY R+ because that's what it is. It's not a freekin' teenager drama but the movie about survival and overcoming the tyranny that was put upon them.They even put president as if he was nothing. Just a dumb guy. They added a \"bonus scenes\" so we can see what's happening \"behind cameras\". Oh God ... even special effects looked as if the movie was made in 2000thish. Seriously movie makers ... if you can't do your job properly, don't do it at all.",
    "53": "Well, they tried.Tried to make a movie about something other than explosions, vampires, and Adam Sandler, but they only succeeded in making a dreary, slow, self-important attempt at social commentary.The hairdos and costumes just aren't enough to carry the whole movie, sorry. I think the movie really tries to be something way more than it is. In the end, it's a story that could be told in 10 or 15 minutes. The future is totally effed up, people are decadent and soulless beyond belief and so we've turned back the clock to the Roman Coliseum for our inspiration for entertainment and social control. It just strains credulity to the breaking point to believe that people would actually act in the manner that they do in the show.Why would the participants form alliances? Why wouldn't they try to escape? Why wouldn't the populace rebel more than they do? And why would the supposed \"games\" take as much time as they do? I've got a hunch that in the real world such games would be over in a matter of minutes. But none of that is explored at all. It's just a contrived bit of dark, dreary, fluff with a monumental amount of special effects.A little more thought and a lot less glitz would've been a much better show, but then, I'm sure I'm not the demographic this was aimed at.",
    "54": "Could somebody please help me out with some questions I have after watching this \"thing\" (can't call it a movie, sorry)? I've read some user critics and basically it says - teenage movie and read the book. So my questions are: - do you think if I read the book I wouldn't still think this \"thing\" isn't still crap? - if you call it a teenage movie do you think our teenagers are so dumb they would see this a perfect movie? - do we want to show our teenagers that killing other children is a \"game\" and if they kill other child people (we adults) will actually cheer at it? - is it ever possible that community at size described in the movie will enjoy children killing children? - how became Kati the chosen one? What was that special on her that everyone start to think this immediately after meeting her once? Why wasn't the chosen one for example the girl who throws the knives 100% all the time or that guy who throws the spear better than Brad Pitt in Troy movie? I found those to be the chosen ones more than a girl who misses stationary training target by half meter....? - How boy from District 12 managed to escape from group of berserk guys who were slaughtering all other kids with just wounded leg? Did he \"run\" away? Can someone explain me also what happened in that well organized - harmonic group? Cause they seem to be great friends killing others and suddenly he finished with stabbed leg...? - Is there any rule that you can pick up only package with number of your district? Cause that guy running for his package could easily grab one-two more easily. Well I was thinking that if it includes something important for guy from particular district - it can be definitely handy for me too. Maybe not immediately but in very close future... but that's just me I am so greedy.can someone return me two and half hour of my wasted life? - have IMDb became useless tool? Cause I consider 7,2 rank still as good movie. I wonder why The Hunger Games doesn't have score somewhere about 3-4% where it belongs.",
    "55": "How is movie about teenagers battling to the death not going to actually show any of the killing?! I paid more attention to it the second time watching and realized that every time someone dies the movie goes silent and cuts away. There is actually only one killing death shown, and it's by accident. The movie did do a good job at not making that noticeable, but it's still a big flaw. And also, why do the tributes have to be teenagers? There was no explanation to that at all. I hope the book explained that somewhat. I thought the end of the tournament was ridiculous. First there could only be one winner, then they announce there can be two, then psych, there can only be one, and then the last two are going to commit suicide, so the government decides two is fine again. If you want to see a far superior movie with practically the same plot then watch Battle Royal. It's subtitled, but it's mostly action anyway so that's not a big deal.",
    "56": "Suzanne Collins' novel was a deserved bestseller because it was fast-paced and intelligent with a strong heroine at its core. Which is why it is so disappointing that the most accurate description of the film version is plodding.Set in a repressive future, where twelve progressively poorer districts pay penance to a rich capital city by way of a lottery that forces a male and female teenage recruit from each district to participate in The Hunger Games, a yearly televised gladiator style competition played until only one survivor is left standing. When her innocent and vulnerable 12-year-old sister is selected against all odds, the resourceful Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her place, and along with the male offering, Peeta, is whisked away to be trained for the deadly games.The film is largely faithful to the novel, but feels compelled to tone certain aspects down to its detriment and add things that are unnecessary. Director Gary Ross provides by-the-numbers direction that is far more dull than inspired. His visions of this world are disappointing. The dirt poor District 12 looks like a set for denizens of Deliverance, except that Katniss, her sister and her friend Gale are entirely too well scrubbed for such a place. By contrast, the capital city and its citizens seem like they were snatched from one of the cheesier episodes of 1960s Star Trek.The set up of the lottery, the trip to the city and the training seems to go on forever. Ross and company provide some very badly done flashbacks to fill in gaps in the narrative. For instance, Katniss is conflicted that Peeta has been chosen since he risked the wrath of his tyrant mother and showed her a kindness when her family was starving. The book told us in a couple of paragraphs. The film requires no less than three flashbacks so vague that those unfamiliar may think Peeta is being mean to her in them by throwing food to pigs.Once the action moves to the Games, it doesn't get any better. The use of music (which can enhance suspense) is severely limited and Ross films the action with one of those jitter-cams, which often makes it near impossible to fathom what is going on. Worse, any time we start to become involved in the action in the forest, Ross and company segue to an added sequence featuring Donald Sutherland's icy president or Wes Bentley's calculating gamesmaster (a character not in the novel) or some other lackluster diversion.The casting which sounds great on paper, turns out to be a mixed bag. Sutherland dusts off his glare as the predominant villain. Bentley is fine, but his role is excess baggage. Woody Harrelson is a great choice to play a former winner who functions as an adviser/agent to the the two main characters, but the script has reigned in or eliminated some of his best moments. Elizabeth Banks is little more than a buffoon as the ludicrous Effie Trinkett, while Lenny Kravitz manages to be sympathetic as a kind stylist.In the core role, Jennifer Lawrence seemed to be a real coup for Katniss. Unfortunately, she comes off like a more mundane Helen Hunt. Katniss should be appealing and dynamic. On paper, she popped. On film, not so much. Part of the problem is that Katniss is conflicted about a number of things and Lawrence has confused conflicted with ambivalence. Instead of filling the gaps destined to happen in a film transfer, Lawrence keeps both the other characters and the viewer at arm's length. We believe she is tough and resourceful and can do miracles with a bow, but she is so aloof for the most part that we don't care. Instead of insight, we get far too many scenes of Lawrence either brooding or weeping as a substitute. When she develops a rapport with a young competitor, Lawrence fails to make us understand why or feel that it is anything other than a plot contrivance. We never feel any doubt in the film that she will triumph, so the film seems to be marching slowly to a preordained climax. Lawrence also shares no chemistry with co-star Josh Hutcherson, which mutes the later moments between them.It is arguably a scripting and acting fault that Hutcherson, despite lack of chemistry with Lawrence, actually emerges as more sympathetic and whose character, whose future seems much murkier, elicits more concern. Hutcherson manages to take on a more passive role, and successfully elicit the sympathy that often and puzzlingly eludes the lead. Yet if Lawrence has no chemistry with Hutcherson, she has even less with Liam Hemsworth as Gale. The film takes a character whose appearance in the novel was basically as a bookend and tries to set the ground for some kind of Twilight-lite triangle. Hemsworth is entirely too clean for District 12, generates no heat with the leading lady and has the thankless task of being reduced to either smiling or pouting - the latter of which he does not do well. Too many segues from the action to Hemsworth looking angsty to remind us that he is in the film and supposed to be of some import become annoying quickly.While not a total disaster by any means, the film truly misses the mark by a farther mile than many would have you believe. The film is neither suspenseful nor does it allow us to really get to know or root for the heroine, a character that jumped off the written page. The additions are ill-conceived and the workmanlike direction proves entirely unsuited for material that requires a surer, more inspired hand. And would someone please tell directors to stop shaking the camera all over the place in some misguided attempt to generate \"you are there\" excitement...it doesn't work.",
    "57": "I have never felt so cheated by a film in my life. This film was advertised as America's answer to Battle Royale. This was a unique opportunity to ponder a dystopian future society, where children are being forced to fight to the death as a means of keeping the population in check. A chilling, thought-provoking concept, which the producers of this film didn't bother to take seriously.You see, halfway through the film I realized I was watching twilight, not Battle Royale. The real plot: Jennifer Lawrence can't decide between Liam Hemsworth and the albino kid. That's it. That's the story. The rest is just dressing. The Hunger Games is cashing in on Twilight's success, a product to be force-fed to a target audience.It's a sick world we live in, where children being made to kill each other serves as a back-story to a love-triangle. Hollywood has no shame, and clearly no imagination. This \"film\", for lack of a better word, is nothing but cheap exploitation, an insult to your intelligence.",
    "58": "Really good movie but, as usual, it wasn't as good as the book which was outstanding. Obviously, you must inevitably cut out quite a bit of content in order to turn a 10 hour book into a 2 hour movie. This is not necessarily where I felt the movie missed it's mark. I didn't mind that certain minor characters were cut out (Madge and the Avox girl) and others' had their roles diminished (the prep team). I also didn't mind that certain characters' roles were embellished for the movie (Gale and Crane). However, while those were things that were necessary for the transition from pages to big screen, certain changes were not and slightly affected the overall feel of the story. ***SPOILER ALERT*** IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK AND INTEND ON IT, QUIT READING NOW. For example, Katniss and Peeta were instructed to never separate from one another during the training session by Haymitch. This was a crucial strategic element and the movie not only glossed over it but actually largely removed it entirely. This made the \"star crossed lovers\" vibe difficult to push. The way the Cato/Thresh thing went down also was unnecessarily changed. It wouldn't have been any longer to keep to the book here. In the book, Cato was more of a villain whereas in the more, while they tried to make him out as one, small changes diminished this effect, this change being just one of them. Now for the biggest areas of the movie where changes weren't necessary. First of all, the Mockingjay, which is the symbol of the entire trilogy, lost all importance in this movie. All tributes take a \"token\" into the arena with them and this was Katniss' token. The fact that she got it from Madge and Madge not being in the movie is irrelevant to the fact that they still could've had this symbol keep it's meaning as a symbol of rebellion and a smack in the face of the Capitol. Secondly, the scene of Rue's death. While I thought the movie did a really good job here, there is a critical moment afterwords where Rue's district shows their appreciation for Katniss' actions by sending her a piece of bread. Katniss then salutes them to show acknowledgment. This should not have changed because it is a major part in Katniss' rebelling against the Capitol. Katniss voluntarily saluting the cameras without initiation didn't make any sense. Instead of sticking to the book, the movie decided to replace this important sequence with a scene of Rue's district revolting. Not only did this not happen in the book but it actually doesn't occur until the second book when Katniss and Peeta take their victory tour. I wonder how they are going to fix this when they make the next movie. I did like some of the changes they did make though. It's not really possible to keep a movie in the first person so showing things that happened outside of the arena (Crane meeting with Snow, the control room, people watching back home, etc.) helped push the third person feel that was a must. Overall, it's impossible to know how I would rate the movie without reading the book which is really strange because you normally know. I might think that the movie was outstanding because I wouldn't know any different. Then again, I might feel like some of the scenes were rushed and not explained thoroughly enough. Nonetheless, it was a really good movie. It could've been great if they would've stayed a little more true to the book but it was still a good film and I look forward to seeing the next two.",
    "59": "Let me start of this review by saying that I have never read The Hunger Games book. That may to some of you discredit what I have to say here, but please read with an open mind.First of all, I only went to see this movie because of the MASSIVE amount of hype its garnered. When I initially saw the preview's to it a few months ago, it did not seem like anything special or something that I personally would I particularly would care to go see. However, I was offered a chance to go see it (Free of charge) here recently so I took up the offer in hopes that I might be pleasantly surprised. Needless to say...I wasn't.In short the Hunger Games is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen and her trials surviving the Hunger Games, which is in itself kind of like televised modern day gladiators. Katniss selflessly volunteers to participate in the games when her much younger more innocent little sister is randomly selected to represent their district.There wasn't very much I cared for in the movie itself. The first half of the movie is spent basically building up to the game itself, showing little tidbits of training and preparation but nothing really exciting. The second half of the movie is mostly just Katness hiding from other competitors waiting for them to pick each other off (Which in reality would be the smart thing to do)...However it makes for a relatively dull movie. The actions sequences in the movie are few and far between, and only mildly exciting when they do occur.The thing that really bothered me about the movie though was the predictability of it all. For example...(MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD)... Katniss and the boy selected to compete alongside her in the games (Peeta Mellark) create a faulty love interest with other in order to gain sponsorship during the games. Which apparently having good sponsorship really helps your odds of winning. Anyway, in order to create suspense the proprietors of the games change the rules which originally stated that there can only be one winner of the games changed to their can be one winning district (two individuals) to win. Of course they go back on their word at the end and expect Katness and Peeta to kill each other; however their plans are thwarted when Peeta and Katness enter into an apparent suicide pact after which they allow them both to live.To me...That was just a total cop out...I would have been much more impressed (And would have raised my IMDb score a few points) had Peeta and Katniss brutally fought it out to the death at the end of the movie.Either way, I refuse to rank this movie any higher than 4/10. It was mildly enjoyable at times, but painfully uninteresting at others.Perhaps if you're a fan of the books then this might be a better watch for you...But speaking from the standpoint of an outsider who had never even heard of the books or the movie until a few months ago...I can wholeheartedly say I was deeply unimpressed.",
    "60": "Last night I finally saw \"The Hunger Games\" and I must confess it's an entertaining movie. Shades of older movies such as \"Rollerball\", \"Logan's Run\" and more recently, \"Battle Royale\" are very present in \"Hunger Games\". In a distant future North America goes through a war that leaves the nation devastated. The war was caused by internal uprising, not a foreign attack. After a lengthy war the state prevails, but much of the nation is left in ruins. As means to remember this sad period, the state organizes a reality show called 'the hunger games', where each of the 12 districts that started the revolts years ago, must submit a young boy and girl to participate in a televised fight to the death, where only one can become the sole victor. This is where this movie veers closely to the Japanese masterpiece \"Battle Royale\", with a premise very much alike.Our heroine comes from district 12, Katniss, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Despite casting a bombshell as a tough warrior, Jennifer pulls it off amazingly well, giving a serious performance. I understand this movie is a book adaptation and, in my case, I haven't read the books or book so I can't really tell if it's a faithful adaptation. A strange feeling invaded me while watching \"The Hunger Games\"; it felt like something big was going to happen, a big revelation or the real truth behind such barbaric game. But this revelation never happened and by the time the film ends I'm left with more questions that answers. Unlike \"Battle Royale\", I developed little sympathy for the rest of the young kids involved in the game. Out of the 24 participants, the movie is designed for the audience to care for only 3 characters: Katniss, Peeta and Rua, that's it. Little or no background is given of the other participants, some of them seemed to really enjoy all the hunting and killing.Little is said about the president of the nation, portrayed by Donald Sutherland, in what I thought was a waste of talent. Again, reading the book would probably help me to understand the many plot holes this movie has. I think more could've been done with the movie's premise, a more social commentary, but director Gary Ross apparently chose not to. In the end, \"The Hunger Games\" is really a light version of \"Battle Royale\".",
    "61": "So why is this movie so incredibly popular? Is it *that* good? No, actually. Not at all.First of all, this stuff is neither new, nor original. \"The Running Man\" has a similar concept, but it's actually more believable. \"Battle Royale\" is basically exactly the same movie, but it's also more realistic. This is some twisted interpretation of \"Big Brother\".No, it wasn't *awful*, but, for such an over-hyped movie, with such a huge budget, and such a high rating... I did expect more.Maybe you have to have read the book (which the movie is based on) to understand it properly, but, since I haven't, I didn't quite get the whole idea behind \"Hunger Games\". It is implied that the purpose of the show is to keep the slums (districts) intimidated, and to prevent rebellion. How does that work, exactly? If you think of it logically, having \"Hunger Games\" INCREASES the chances of rebellion e.g. families prepare their kids from a young age for the possibility that they might be chosen to enter the game at some point, so a large % of the districts' inhabitants are supposed to be good warriors, with solid survival skills, well prepared to kill and hunt. Not to mention the hatred they all seem to feel towards the organizers of the game. Does this not INCREASE the chances of rebellion instead of decreasing them??And why couldn't these kids just refuse to \"play\"? The spectators expect to see people kill each other, so what would happen if the kids just stuck together and didn't give those viewers what they wanted? They'd be forced to stop \"Hunger Games\" altogether if, season after season, people refused to \"play\".And... erm, I didn't quite get the \"hunger\" reference anyway. There was no evidence of the supposed scarcity of food, and the characters didn't really seem like they were starving. And what exactly is the connection between \"hunger\" and children killing each other? The \"future\" society looks like the 19th century, and they, most certainly, don't give out the impression of being capable to produce \"genetically engineered killer bees\", or medicine that can heal a deep wound in less than 8 hours. It was totally unrealistic. The so-called future looked more like the past. It was extremely primitive, actually. Didn't make any sense.How is it possible to generate images of animals/trees on a computer screen and then instantly transfer them to a physical location as actual living objects (wild animals, burning trees). It would only be possible if the battleground was a simulated environment, which, as far as I'm aware, it wasn't in this case.Character development was really, really sub-par. We know NOTHING about the lead male. No background on him whatsoever. Same goes for the antagonist. Not to mention the rest of the \"players\" -- we hardly see any of them, except for Rue (briefly), who, as a matter of fact, serves no purpose whatsoever, and adds nothing to the story. Elisabeth Banks is s***, as usual.I didn't see the point in Liam Hemsworth's character? What purpose did he serve? Why did the lead male side with the bad guys? Is isn't explained. And why did they actually accept him into their group -- knowing that he is romantically interested in the girl they're hunting down? And why DID the \"bad guys\" form a group to begin with -- knowing that there can only be one survivor anyway? O.K., so there are 4 of them in this group, and they are hunting down the lead female. What happens after they kill her? They will still have to kill each other, so... what is the point forming a group to begin with? The MOST unrealistic scene in the movie, was the one where the lead female climbs a tree and the bad guys decide to camp beneath her. They could've EASILY shot an arrow at her or set the tree on fire, but they decide to wait for her to come down. O.K., but, in that case, since there are 4 of them, they should've taken turns to watch her, but, instead, they all go to sleep (and wake up) at the same time. How dumb can they be? And that love story between the lead characters was so incredibly lame... I do not want to see anymore of Twilight. That franchise is really getting on my last nerve, and it doesn't help that a lot of movies copy elements from it nowadays. Very disturbing!Anyway...The movie is watchable, but there are a few too many plot holes for my liking, which is really distracting and unsatisfying. I was waiting for some of the answer to be revealed throughout the movie, but... nothing.It's just an extremely poorly pieced together story that, at times, is more frustrating than entertaining.1 star to bring down the overall rating, which is currently much higher than the movie deserves. Otherwise would've rater 5-6.",
    "62": "In the past couple of years Hollywood has piled on the films made from best sellers, from Harry Potter to Twilight. It's a safe bet for the movie makers cause if the books were read by millions (mainly teenagers) then it's likely that people will watch the film. Though the Hunger Games was a lot more serious than those two, apart from say the last 2 potter books, with a more brutal theme if not new because the successful Japanese Battle Royal was out first but Hunger Games was a best seller so Lions Gate made the film. If someone knows how to make something big out of something small that's LG. They didn't have any mega successes but that's why the made HG. First off we can thank Lions Gate for finding a good director and placing a lot of energy on finding the actors. And they got a good script written. They even paid attention to the budget. Let's talk about the story: The nation of Panem consists of a wealthy Capitol ruling twelve poorer districts. As punishment for a past rebellion, each district must provide two \"tributes\" - one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 selected by lottery (the \"Reaping\") - every year to compete in the Hunger Games; they must fight to the death in a vast arena, with the sole survivor rewarded with fame and wealth. In District 12, when Primrose Everdeen is chosen in her first Reaping, her older sister Katniss, an expert archer, volunteers to take her place. Peeta Mellark, a baker's son, is selected as the other district tribute. After the two youngsters find sponsors, train they start the HG. Where there is no friendship or innocence only survival. Though the film doesn't clear up a bunch of things, I'm guessing because of time constraints (what's with the hand signal?) they did build up a cool world. Maybe a strange communist world mixed with Rome? Despite that sometimes you can see that they should have spent more money on this or that the set and the filming is great. The atmosphere is great and the awesome music helps that too. The actors are believable, with co-stars like Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz, Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci. And the star Jennifer Lawrence has already proved herself before this film in Winter's Bone and she didn't disappoint here either and was someone you can build a franchise on. The film can be split into two parts, I liked the first part better, the whole build up of the show. The actual game was maybe a little jolty. I didn't really get the \"there can only be one\", animal, killer instinct feeling as their motivators, and I thought there would be more blood, sweat and one on one fights. They probably tied the directors Gary Ross' hands to tightly, because unfortunately watching what rating it got was important plus if you want more blood watch Battle Royal or the Running Man. All in all you can really feel that LG did everything to make something good out of a book from a recycled story, they were paying attention to how much they could potentially make from the franchise. This worked through most of the film but by the end I just thought it was a good job, but it still is good to see that a YA book adaptation can be done well. I give it a 6/10 with the side note that if you want to see genius watch Battle Royal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg0FxMyBLP8",
    "63": "I had heard so much \"hype\" about this movie from the media and from co-workers, that when this came out I debated whether or not I was going to see it. After all, they had spent countless hours discussing their \"craze\" about the books, etc and had pre-ordered their movie tickets to see it the second it came out. Obsessed much? I think so. Anyhow, I took a chance and saw it before it left the theaters. Why did I see it? I have no idea. The plot of the story was very disappointing. Kids killing other children. What has America come too? Sure we have our military fighting for us, for our freedoms, so that we can even go and see a stupid movie such as this, but to cheer on kids fighting and killing other kids til their death?

    "64": "Sort of a witless, teenybopper version of The Running Man, Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 black comedy of game shows gone amok, The Hunger Games is a hash of random thought and truly the worst professional cinematography in a major motion picture I've seen in 50 years of film-going. (It often appears that the camera operator is going through an epileptic fit during a tornado. And that's when people are eating lunch. In a fight scene it feels like an espresso OD might be happening as well.) There are enough plot holes, lapses in logic and dopey coincidences in this film that it would take a volume longer than the entire trilogy to detail them. But let's start--and end, with this one: This is the 75th televised Hunger Game. Entire districts turn out every year to watch their hometown champions. Why then are ANY of the participants unprepared for ANYTHING that happens? That being said, Jennifer Lawrence is the only reason to see this film, and you could do yourself a huge favor by renting Winter's Bone instead. It's shorter by about 90 minutes and Lawrence plays a similar, if tougher, smarter character in that one. The rest of The Hunger Game's cast is either a) brutally, bizarrely over-dressed and over-coiffed or b) faceless and dull. This is a bad, bad movie. And you know what? I'm saying this and I saw the movie for free one Saturday afternoon. Imagine how angry I'd be if I had paid to attend?",

Whilst watching this film, you need to forget about the book and think that this started as a film.The scenes are effective and action packed which keeps you wanting more! Surprisingly, it didn't seem to go on for 2 hours 22 minutes. The acting was great and believable for all the characters. This film was... different,in a good way, to other films with reasons like the camera angles and effects. There's nothing much more to say except you'll be sorry if you miss this cinematic experience and that this film definitely deserves a 9/10! I hope you use my advice,book readers, on not thinking about the book because if you do, you'll struggle to enjoy the amazing movie! The hunger games is definitely a MUST SEE MOVIE!",
    "66": "The creative philosophy underpinning DEATH RACE 2000, ROLLERBALL, THE RUNNING MAN and others re-imagined here for the TWILIGHT tweenies. A survivalist action-drama set in a dystopian future, it does for bleak prophetic sci-fi bread and circus flicks what TWILIGHT did for vampire cinema. It's teen-trendy, twee, diluted and toothless. Vapid, unchallenging and oh-so safe with every punch tastefully pulled, every mock-emotional set-piece carefully orchestrated to tug the superficial heartstrings of the wannabe emo self-harmer brigade. Overlong. Really overlong. And it was tripe.What this stuff needs is jet-black humour and vengeful rebellion to make it work. For the protagonists to win and turn on the architects of their plight with guns. cudgels and knives and pulverise their asses in a climax of violence, retribution and destruction.

I got the impression to get food they had to have their names put in the drawing each time they did but it wasn't explained. My daughter said it wasn't in the movie but it was. I have the books but neither of us have actually read them yet. I also thought there was enough blood in the movie to make the point of what was going on. No one needs raw gore unless they are a sadist. It doesn't matter if the over all theme has been done before. Look at all the vampire movies. The stories may be similar but overall it is different and all of them vary. That is not important.I liked the girl who was cast as the lead but I almost didn't watch it when I found out Hutcherson was in it. He is one of the worst young actors around. He didn't fit the part as they were trying to portray it. He isn't that attractive and he always seems so childlike. I think that was a big miscast. I also didn't like Woody Harrelson. I don't like either of these actors so that sort of turned me off and then having Sutherland who is too old for the part I think. He is in too many movies like Liam Neeson. I thought his part was sort of milk toast.The movie is all right but I don't understand why it was such a big box office success for the life of me. The acting was adequate and it is a bizarre movie. Some writers don't always want tragic endings and I have to say I am glad they are getting away from that trend. I watch movies for entertainment. This movie seems on a par with a TV movie to me and I can't say I didn't like it but I was disappointed.",
    "68": "I really enjoyed the novel by Suzanne Collins (not so much the sequels, Catching Fire recycled way too many elements from the first novel and I didn't even bother reading Mockingjay), but I was very disappointed with this movie. Let me enlighten you (I'll try to compare with the novel as much as I can, but mind you it's been a while since I read it).For starters, the beginning seems stretched out a lot. And I mean, A LOT. For the first hour and a thirty minutes or so, we are given descriptions of how the games will be. Through interviews, talk shows, press conferences, seeing the tributes train and prepare for it, etc... The way the film is constructed at the beginning is, in no ways, amateurish, and is actually pretty well done, but I started lacking interest in it about 50 minutes in. It just isn't all that interesting after a while. By now, after the hour and a half of massing pumping and hyping, you would expect the last half of the movie to be epic, to be impressive, yes? Unfortunately, it isn't. The problem is that the filmmakers tried to market a very violent novel for mature teenagers with a violent premise to kids. The camera keeps shaking constantly to not show any details, and it is annoying, because you end up practically not seeing anything at all. You have to be very, very focused on the screen to make out practically any action occurring in the second half. A lot of things also seem pointless...Peeta's camouflage in the dirt being the most pointless of all. How useful was it to the story? He showed it to Katniss, as if to waste our time, and never used it after...The film could also have used more screen time for Haymitch. Woody Harrelson is perfect for the character, and in the novel, Haymitch had some pretty interesting things to say. But, in this movie, Haymitch is so underused that we barely get to see his drunken antics and his powerful thoughts. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket is really annoying...No fault of Banks, the character is just plain annoying, and yet she has more screen time than the 100 times more interesting Haymitch. Effie Trinket really bothered the hell out of me.Still, there's some positive to be had: The acting. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Katniss Everdeen. Her performance is enough to carry this huge-budgeted overlong film on her shoulders when the film needs it most. Always in character, Jennifer Lawrence shows us all her talents as an actress. It was the second time I saw her in a movie since the amazing X-Men First Class, and I can't wait to see more work out of her. Josh Hutcherson delivers the merchandise in a performance slightly inferior to Lawrence's. Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Wes Bently, hell, even Lenny Kravitz gives in a respectable performance. And I have nothing negative to say about not one, but two great climaxes. I liked that the film doesn't end all happy-go-lucky like traditional Hollywood movies, but it foreshadows a sequel, which, I sincerely hope, will be better, darker, and braver than this movie. Overall, this is a film that could have been so much more. I do not get all the love it has been getting. While all the actors give great performances (Jennifer Lawrence especially), the action is underwhelming and the build-up to the action is way too overlong and packed with unnecessary details. If you want an idea of what The Hunger Games should have resembled, watch the Japanese movie Battle Royale. Now that is one very intense movie. DISCLAIMER: I'm not a Battle Royale fanatic trying to bash The Hunger Games, I actually first heard of Battle Royale after watching this movie. I just think that, personally, after having viewed both, Battle Royale is much better than The Hunger Games. (I strongly recommend reading The Hunger Games over the viewing of the film).",
    "69": "Even knowing quite a bit about the heavily hyped film before I saw it (on DVD), I was still very disappointed. This is a poorly made film, very lackluster and the only reason to rave over it is sheer \"fanboy-ism\" -- you just love the books so much, or the heroine Katniss, or the strikingly pretty actress Jennifer Lawrence, that you cannot view the film objectively.It is boring, it is disjointed. If you go in to it, not knowing the story beforehand or having read the book (or trilogy of books), it would make little sense -- just a lot of carnage without much rational explanation.Yes, the books were influenced by the Japanese \"Battle Royale\" and yes, some films like \"Running Man\" and others. That did not bother me. The first book of the trilogy is strongly written, with moving prose and a very appealing female heroine; it was nice to read a book for young adults (and it IS a book for teens, not adults) that is not all about \"who the female protagonist loves?\" and \"who will she choose?\" and/or the bitchiness of her teen female rivals.Susanne Collins treated Katniss like a real heroine, whose journey was important than her romantic life, ergo this was a MUCH better book than \"Twilight\", with its weak, clumsy Bella Swan who just falls into romance with her sparkly vampire lover. I loved Katniss in the book, and wanted to read about her journey.So that brings me to the biggest flaw of the film version: Jennifer Lawrence, gorgeous and sexy, is 100% wrong for this role. Darkening her hair and making it messy will not turn this stone fox into anything but what she is -- a super beautiful 21 year old woman. Katniss, on the other hand, is STARVING -- I repeat, STARVING -- skinny, underweight 16 year old, who the books say \"looks about 12\" due to malnutrition, who has short boyish hair and dark skin (it is implied she is of mixed race).Lawrence was clearly picked because of her stunning debut in \"Winter's Bone\", and hey! that was set in the rural Ozarks, with her as a uneducated mountain girl. But the resemblance ends there; Ree Dolly was nothing like Katniss, except \"rural\".Myself, I was rooting for Hailie Steinberg (\"True Grit\") who was the right age and physical type for this part. But I am sure many young actresses might have done a good job. Lawrence, with her voluptuous body and sturdy frame, does not remotely convince us she's ever missed a snack, let alone a balanced 3 course meal, in her life.Everyone else in the film is similar good looking, evoking a TV show with teen stars rather than Dorothy Lange photos of Depression-era Appalachia (which the book DOES evoke). These big strapping movie-star gorgeous actors don't look hungry; they don't even have a smear of dirt on their faces. None of them, including Lawrence, ever look remotely scared or worried, hungry or thirsty, angry or sad. It's like watching a cast of good looking robots beat each other up.The violence, which in the book is quite upsetting, is blurred and subdued -- OK if your kids want to watch this, worthless as dramatic narrative. There is no sense of loss when anyone dies, not even cute tiny little Rue.The movie costume crew had some fun dressing the citizens of The Capitol in over-the-top costumes -- kind of mash-up of \"The Fifth Element\" and the Court of the Sun King -- but the Lady Gaga-like results just look silly and not menacing. Much more effective if they looks banal, like our TV talk show hosts and politicians are nowadays. Blue wigs and hot pink makeup make them look like ineffectual clowns.Of the 3 novels, this first one is by far the most affecting, serious and well-written; the sequels are quite weak. Lacking the big action set pieces and the fact that the heroine sleeps through most of them, I can't imagine where this is going. Jennifer Lawrence, though: she is going to be a BIG big star, that's already written in the cement.In short: not recommended, especially for adults who will be bored.",
    "70": "(spoilers abound) My daughter read the first book after I had read all three and we went to the movie yesterday. I don't know where to start with how disappointed I was. There was little to no character development. You don't understand the bond between Katniss and Peeta - you don't like Josh Hutcherson - terrible terrible casting there. I was excited with Cinna's casting, but they don't show what an important part of her life he becomes in a short time or even the three who make her over. The arena scene was limp ...all the gripping emotional struggles she goes through, are virtually left out. Things that are important are changed...the Mockingjay pin's origin, for instance. The (spoiler)animals at the end with the horrible eyes of the dead. The Mockingjays don't SING they whistle. The thing about Mockingjays is they talk in the voice of the speaker. They would have sung Rue's song. From the initial shaky camera work to the casting, to the last scene...I did NOT like this movie. Terrible disappointment as far as I'm concerned. If you love the books, you'll go see the movie, just be prepared to dislike it. In fact, parts of it at the beginning, well, practically the first hour and a half are terribly slow and boring.",
    "71": "you read it right this film is pile of junk & may i ask what were some of the good actors doing there like Wes Bentley .i mean what the hell is this about the story shows that N.America is divided and is names Panem.with 12 districts .the 2 young people are selected each year to participate in hunger games.and those are televised & everyone is watching them on TV in Panem this film looks like Rambo meets Jason Bourne but i had hopes because i didn't have even seen the Pics or trailers of the movie.hoped for some action & brutality but it sucked at it.why didn't they used guns in this film if they are allowed to kill and win what exactly is the hunger games its filled with cheap wannabes pretending to be tougher but end up failing.& Jennifer Lawrence cant act she can only smooch in movies with her big fish lips.maybe if you put some dirt on a basketball stadium she would suck it up . put AL Pacino in this and it would look better.this film wastes not only the time & money but it spins your head also i am shocked at why everyone is going crazy about this film.people lost the taste. & i read it just beat titanic which is re released on 3d.just see some old James bond films like golden-eye or something, its crappy film like these are ruining cinema.what a shame.i am sorry but i have to warn others please do not watch this for free you will regret.there are no games in this film its an insult to sportsmy rating is 0/10 most awful film in history .there is a Japanese film called battle Royal i think ill go check that out it would be better then this trash",
    "72": "Having read the books, I wasn't sure how they would capture this dystopian adventure on film. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie does a nice job of setting up the back-story and history leading up to the Hunger Games themselves. I thought that the casting was on the spot and Jennifer Lawrence captures the depth and strength of our heroine Katniss with aplomb. The book had a fairly dense storyline, so there are always sacrifices that must be made in bringing it to film. However, the story hits the high points well. While it's a little slow out of the gate, it finishes strong. If I had to offer a criticism, it would be the lack of emotional depth in some scenes, which too often was sacrificed to the momentum of the story. I expect that the coming 2nd film will be the real highlight of this series as the book was packed with action.",
    "73": "I have to confess that I've never heard of the book \"The Hunger Games\" or that novel's author, Suzanne Collins, and if it hadn't been for the hype surrounding this movie and the way it seemed to capture the public's attention, I probably wouldn't have even bothered. Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening. In summary, I loved The Hunger Games and I can't wait for the sequels when they come!",
    "74": "Hunger Games is a great movie combining all the 12 factions together and making them fight to rhe death will make a good action film. Lawrence does a great job as Katniss and makes us really feel for the character as her and Peet fall in love. Each shop fully captures and sets the mood for what the director wants you to see. The Capitol is vibrant and colorful. CGI is good and the actual Hunger Games are amazing. Making the two leads actually seem in love. Overall, I'm happy with this and think of is a good interpretation of the book.",
    "75": "An unoriginal concept which has been done before (yes, we're all thinking Battle Royale). Acting was above average though. However, at one point, Katniss' (Jennifer Lawrence) mourning of Rue was too dramatic and over the top.The shaky camera effect was at first mildly irritating and annoying, but I guess the audience becomes adjusted to the shakiness about a third of the way into the film.Some of the scenes were very unbelievable e.g. The evil gang failing to kill Katniss because she climbed up a tree. I distinctively recall one of the clique members being able to throw a pocket knife skillfully enough to kill a lizard.... and the rival archer gave up after two arrow shots? I found Katniss's naivety to be too unbelievable. I know this is a sci-fi movie based on a novel, but come on, did she not for a moment fear that Rue would betray her?I am giving this title a 2/10 since I do not believe it deserves the great acclaim that it currently has.",
    "76": "Reading all the ratings here you would never know this was a great movie. I was curious after many years had passed and had a chuckle seeing only 7.2 score with hordes of haters complaining that it wasn't Battle Royale.You know why it wasn't Battle Royale?Because it is Hunger Games you freaking idiots.And if you wish it was even darker and more violent, go watch SAW. or Human Centipede..that's where your true souls reside.Meantime, this is a great movie that even certain kids can watch with parental guidance.. family viewing which is for kids who b benefit by early education into the complexities of social wars, without putting SAW or Human Centipedes in their faces, while being dark enough, colorful enough, complex enough to entertain the adult appetite.Highly recommended.",
    "77": "I saw this at a preview screening and having never read the books I was unaware what all the fuss is about. Now having just seen the film, I am still unaware what all the fuss is about..The central story concerns a future society where 12 areas (or Districts) have been locked down under police guard and wire fences, after they have held a rebellion against the state at some point. In punishment for this rebellion and for rising up against said state; they have to provide 2 kids between 12-18 (tributes) each year to fight in 'The Hunger Games' -a no holds-barred death match tournament, in which there can be only one winner. This is televised round the world and can be manipulated depending on how the action is heating up and who the audience's favourites are (similar to a certain Arnie movie). We follow a girl / woman from District 12, who volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the tournament, after she had been selected and didn't want to go. She travels to the capital with another boy from the district and there they begin extensive training ready for the games to begin. I won't go into any more detail without wishing to spoil the other parts of the story but once the tournament starts - there begins a love story, various double crossing and in a brilliant stand-out scene; a hilarious disguise that even Andy Mcnab or Bear Grylls in their special forces days would not have been able conjure up..The acting is OK, but the dialogue seems pretty trite and the future-scape and costumes, look like someone has just watched a combination of Equilibrium and the 5th Element over and over and over and over again (Having not read the book I don't know whether these costumes were accurate to that?). The main issue is that the violence is fairly none existent due to the intended teenage audience, therefore surely losing any power about the wrongs of such a tournament? If you're trying to make a point about violence being glorified in the media or a tournament, to water it down or even worse allow the viewer to 'escape' this horror just seems pointless. The kids are all good looking and clean cut, some of whom are slightly annoying but are given no back-story in the film. So aside from our two heroes you really don't have any vested interest in seeing them survive and obviously because you don't really see any of them die it just doesn't seem that meaningful and they appear to just be making up the numbers.Overall we all know it's going to make loads of money because there is a die-hard faithful chomping at the bit to see it...but I just didn't get it. It's a very good looking but ultimately fairly empty film. I won't go down the Battle Royale route but obviously they are incredible similar, so make up your own mind about whether this has been 'influenced' by that.. but I do feel this has been done better and on a lower budget before.5/10",
    "78": "if you read the source material, it's very violent, brutal, bloody, gory, and has nonstop action and mayhem once it gets going, the movie is the exact opposite, it's SEVERELY watered down, too tame, not violent enough, there's a severe lack of action, there's no suspense, and the shaky cam and cut aways EVERY FIVE SECONDS annoyed the ever loving crap out of me. I'm one of the many people that wishes this and the other three movies were Rated R and a lot more violent so they could REALLY show the terror of the games and how unpleasant panem really is.P.S. stick with battle royale 1 and 2 instead",
    "79": "I do not honestly understand all the fuzz about this movie. It is bad, it loosely based on a Japanase (excellent) cult movie (and this is already disappointing since the time all US remakes of excellent Japanese movies are 99% of the times simply ill conceived) and it is simply boring as hell and full of stupid incongruence. It is a teen movie, OK, but it is not that great. It is basically a representation of a story using a story line that resembles a lot talent shows such as American Idol and the like.There is the Host Stanley Tucci and the contenders and of course one of them is the girl on fire and there are rumors of a love story between her and one of her opponents...Come on... This is all so cheap and cheesy that it could be even worse than any reality show you have seen so far...Of course if, you love Reality shows, this movie is for you!",
    "80": "(SPOILERS) So I watched this movie before I've read the book (boy, I learned my lesson when I did that with Percy Jackson) and I was hardly paying attention. I drank four Cokes, and I had to go (movie theaters do that to me). I was also with friends, so I tried my best to hold it and watch. I liked nothing about this movie. I have developed a distaste for dystopia ever since watching/reading The Hunger Games. Since I wasn't really paying attention, I sorta let this slid. It was later I received a book report on a book of my choosing. So, not being a reader, I choose one my sister had in her closet. Only now do I understand why she put it there. There's a reason Suzanne Collins' book is 5 bucks. But I'm not gonna discuss the book, it's the movie that's even worse. I have never liked Katniss. So \"Bold\" and \"Brave\". . . Yea, she was wearing a fire-dress and tied herself to a tree. That's so daring. Oh no, what if those other kids actually used common sense and burnt it down? Then I guess she could break out the Karate she learned from the owl in the woods back home. Katniss had no real character growth, in my opinion. Yes, capital people are snobs, we got that the moment you were all expected to fight to the death. Katniss became so resourceful. Finding 11's little girl was the best thing that happened to her. And in the end she got speared in the gut. Katniss, wow, I expected you to tear up, but shouldn't you be, I don't know, running for your life, not placing pretty flowers on her dead body? Oh, wait, it's the sentimental value, right? So while Katniss is speaking for the trees and take a hundred naps, Peetah has gone Darthvader and joined the dark side. So while he was secretly protecting Katniss by playing the bad guy's lap dog, he was cunningly scheming for a way to save her. Why? Cause he developed a crush on her the first day of school. (why do they have school if most are gonna enter the death games?) So, while he's making his \"Peetah's Clever and Intelligent Plan\" (How To Train Your Dragon Book readers get that) Katniss got close and personal with \"The Bees\". Thank God she doesn't have allergies. So Katniss kills a girl, looks very mean for hurting Peetah, and runs away. With another enemy. Who healed her? Why? It's all or nothing? How did Rue even know Katniss wasn't gonna kill her? Big bugging issue for me; Peetah's a baker and a genius artist. There is no way anyone in their town can afford a cake with that much icing detail. And their icing should be mud, right? If Peetah was bleeding out and dying, how did he find the time to paint one side of his entire body? Where did he get the paint? Why'd he \"trust\" Katniss when she thought he was trying to kill her? Also, what's this \"I'm gonna kill this chick, and that dude, but not you. I have the perfect chance in this Life or Death battle, but you look pretty cool, so I'm gonna let you hunt me down later. EVEN THOUGH you and your partner are about to die and I could win. . .\" from 11's boy? Never read past Book 1, never want to.There are times when you watch an okay movie and people urge you to read the \"so much better\" book. This is one of those times I really regretted it. Being a die-hard book fan, I have a utter most respect for any and every writer, no matter what. The fact that you can write something, and have the guts to show it, is in itself a great accomplishment. But when you take an original idea and somehow decrease it's decency to mundane, that's when you lose yourself as a writer. Same with copying (we saw Stephanie Myers do that to Animorphs with The Host) Same with movies. Taking something great and making it better is amazing but also rare. Taking an already diluted and paper-thin idea and making it worse is astounding. Still, I can respect the fact that some DID film the movie and put the ideas together. But who's the lazy-guy that did all the shots? One of an leg, an ear, Rue's dead body's side, Katniss stepping on a leaf. That's just sad.And I'll say it again, I love movies and books. There both amazing creative works. But, this is leaving a bad-taste in my mouth. There are only two books out of hundreds I've read that I actual disliked. Only one book have I stopped in the middle because of how bad it was. I finished the Hunger Game's to find the sad cliché of Katniss using Peetah but finding out she actually liked him somewhat. Oh, but look who's not interested after years of stalking. So prepare for the next movie, Katniss tries to get Peetah to fall in love with her again. And the finale! They are together, but something is separating them. Let me guess, Katniss is somewhere so far far away, and it breaks both their fragile little hearts.I actually wanna dare people to watch this, and see if they agree with me or disagree. That whole \"I can do camouflage cause I'm a baker\" still gets to me, and is a poor poor excuse to make Peetah a little less useless. 1/10, for a sad movie adaption, a sad plot to begin with (could have been decent) and for giving Katniss a useless baker to love instead of that amazing, great looking, wonderful, other dude (He was so totally interest. . . sorta. (Yeah, I so remember his name, I just wanna make him seem. . . mysterious). . .",
    "81": "This is not so much a review, everything has already been said in the other postings, but rather my experience with this movie and book.OK, look, I'm probably old enough to be the grandfather of most of the people submitting reviews to this movie. I am not into the teen age drivel that seems to be everywhere you look these days but .....I first heard about the story when the book came out. It seemed you couldn't turn around without hearing it being discussed everywhere. The enormous hype made me mildly curious, but not so curious that I wanted to read the book. Fast forward several years: the book had been out, the movie hade been out, the DVD had been out and only then did I accidentally stumble across the DVD at the library. I could check it out for free and if I didn't like it I could turn it off after ten minutes ... so, why not?I immediately found myself captivated by the beautiful cinematography and background theme and despite the over-the-top and ridiculous costumes and makeup of the people in The Capitol I decided to continue watching. I was drawn deeper and deeper into the story and the characters and after about a fourth of the way through I knew I was hooked. The acting, starting with Jennifer Lawrence, was exceptionally good. I have to go through about 25 movies before I find one that I can say I absolutely loved ... this was a 25er.To finish my story: unbelievably, when I returned the DVD to the library, on a table in the lobby of the library where they sold used books cheaply, I found a mint condition copy of the book (the big paperback format) for fifty cents. I grabbed it. I began reading the book when I got home and couldn't put it down even though I already knew the story. Collins' writing style was as captivating as her story and the very few differences between the movie and the book were not worth mentioning. Actually, I thought the movie version of the ending was better (just couldn't imagine Rue as a werewolf).I now own, and have seen and read, all of the books and movies of the franchise and consider them among some of the best entertainment of my life. SO it seems the old adage is wrong because you really CAN teach an old dog new tricks. Other young adult movies came out after 'The Hunger Games' which tried to capitalize on the same type of theme and they, by comparison, have failed miserably in my estimation.",
    "82": "The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It's amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don't know what else to say about it, but it's silent, gritty, and compelling.",
    "83": "There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be.",
    "84": "In a cinematic world of re-makes, re-imaginings and full-blown copies, it's inevitable to see a movie like The Hunger Games wallow in the limelight and hysteria of mainstream banality and post-Potter hunger simply because it's there. Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses. This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold, but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved of a character or scenario to really care about.A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit, freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy, shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the \"greater good\" and fun of a bent society. Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power; The Hunger Games.The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles, scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone; turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank.",
    "85": "The hunger game is a game that everyone is not willing to participate in.In this killing game with no humanity, no rules, and no shame, the purpose of the game is just to make people forget to resist and lose their humanity.One of the most important rules of the hunger game is: only one survives.This man returned Yijin to the \"privilege, wealth, reputation, prosperity\" that the poor compatriots in his hometown envied.Every game, everyone will watch. In the process of watching, everyone is immersed in it.At this moment there must be countless ideas in their hearts. But under the guns of the army and under the huge screen, there is no way to show ideas.Paying attention to the game itself is the only correct expression.What is suppressed is human nature\nMany people expressed their desire to live according to their own wishes, and they did not want to be a pawn at their disposal. They are normal human beings with thoughts, humanity and desires, not desperate hunting machines.It's just that in the end, either look at the distance or choose to die. A certain area can't stand it, it's a riot. They were greeted by repression, slaughter, bloodbath, and company.In the game, the last deceased thinks he understands the rules of the game before dying and thinks the winner is the default. In fact, the outcome of the game does not matter to the president.This supreme commander doesn't care who the dead person is or whoever wins. The only thing he was afraid of was surprise, surprise, and people 's emotions beyond control, their yearning for silencer, and their resistance to bondage.",
    "86": "There was a great deal of hype and fuss when The Hunger Games came out as a film and perhaps I should have known I was not target audience because up till then I had never heard of the book series (or indeed that a film was being made). Although with the usual hoopla that goes with any large film, quite a few critics I respect gave it surprisingly good reviews and I decided I would check it out at some point as it seemed to offer more than just a copy of Battle Royale for American teenagers. With all the fuss (and teenage audience) I was very happy to let it go by in the cinemas and instead I waited for the DVD.The film offers a lot of potential and this potential is evident from the start because it sets out its stall to be many things. Firstly there is plenty of room for satire by virtue of this exaggerated futuristic world where this annual murder is presented as both entertainment and also as a way of punishing the masses and keeping them in their place while those with the power enjoy the best of life. Secondly there is the opportunity to draw the audience into being a viewer of this very thing and then confronting us with the horror of what it really means so that there is at least a part of us questioning what we're finding entertaining. I wasn't looking for this to be some incredibly dark film that spits out an audience full of self-loathing and introspection, but I did expect it to be intelligent and impacting on some level to make it stand out from being just a teen-friendly adventure story.The film itself surprised me by falling far short of what it could have been and squandering or ignoring most of the things of the potential it had. In terms of the satire, it never convinced me of the world it had created – it seemed unnecessarily excessive and didn't have enough truth to it to make me believe. I got the impression that it wasn't particularly interested in making the world function as a real place either – just that it was on screen was enough. As a place for commentary or digs at real things, it wasn't that it picked easy targets or easy shots, it was more a matter of it not really having much interest in saying anything beyond a few very basic things. This is a problem not only because it wasted potential but also because the first hour or so of this film is entirely in this world.The second hour is within the games itself and as such it does have dramatic moments as one would expect (it is after all, an expensive Hollywood thriller), however these are fewer than I would have liked and also a lot less impacting – I watched most of it with a removal that I shouldn't have had. The delivery of children violently murdering other is only horrifying in regards how sanitised and unhorrific it is. I wasn't looking for it to be really gory or to revel in the blood, but it certainly should not have been something that I watch without any reaction. This lack of horror (even just emotional horror) leaves the game as a rather hollow affair which eventually turns into a standard thriller where we root for the \"good\" kids over the \"bad\" kids, even though it would have been stronger to have not drawn that very easy line.The performances are mostly solid even though the majority have little to work with. Lawrence is a good actress and she adds a weight to her character tat doesn't seem to come from anywhere but her. I liked her throughout – even terrible \"fire\" special effects seemed unable to make her look bad. The supporting cast aren't able to bring as much as her to the table – even though there are plenty of big names here. The majority of the other children are carefully cast and given exits from the story that befits the easy-road approach to the plot.I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but I was surprised to find that the words sanitised, safe and standard were the ones that kept going through my mind considering I was watching a globally successful satire that uses the murder of children by other children as its core plot. As it is The Hunger Games comes off as a lot of ideas that have been done better elsewhere and any teeth it may have had are all smoothed down and buffed into a consumer friendly product that will undoubtedly become a smash franchise – my only hope is that the next film can deliver some of its promise and not just churn out something as safe, generic and frankly unmemorable as this one.",
    "87": "One of the things I liked the most about reading 'The Hunger Games' was the intensity of how it was written. Feeling the story seemed maybe even more important than reading it, so when I went to see the movie, my expectations were very high.On the upside: Great performance by the main characters, excellent visuals and well directed.On the downside: The book gives a lot of context as to how the characters feel and how things have come to be the way they are. The movie changes a number of things to make it at all possible to show the story and for me the choices made took down the quality of the story a bit. To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in my opinion, didn't really develop in depth the way they should.Long story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the book.",
    "88": "Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the \"The Hunger Games\" book series by Suzanne Collins. I've read them countless times and when I found out they were making a movie of them a little over a year ago I was very excited. But I was also worried.\"The Hunger Games\" is not very easy source material. The book is written in first person narrative with very detailed descriptions of everything form the characters' looks to the strange futuristic devices they use in Panem, the future version of the U.S. where the story takes place. I couldn't imagine that they would be able to convey every detail as I had imagined it and make the story believable without an R-rating or a huge budget. All of my concerns were wiped away when I saw the movie.I've never seen a more faithful adaption of a book in my life. All of the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cast (I'll talk more about them in a while) and the pacing is as if they were exactly replicated from the book. And the small things that do differ or are added (such as more insight to the gamemakers' control room) only add to the amazing world Collins created and improve the narrative movie-wise. And the movie is great for people who haven't read the books as well. Not once did I feel as if something was vague or badly explained.The cast is stellar. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss carries the movie and makes me regret complaining about her casting because she was too \"hot\" and not starved enough. She IS Katniss and one can feel the graveness of an situation just by looking at one of her expressions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is also a true breakout performance. The way he looks at Katniss will makes girls all over the world envy her, just like it's supposed to be. Other standouts in the cast include Stanley Tucci as the flamboyant talk-show host Caesar Flickerman, Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic but caring mentor Haymitch and Wes Bentley as the sinister game-maker Seneca Crane (his final scene might be the best one in the whole movie). The child actors Willow Shields and Amandla Stendberg who portrays Prim and Rue are believable and heartbreaking even though they're inexperienced.Despite the PG-13 rating the movie doesn't gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience. The violence may not be gloriously graphic but it's still there. People will feel the tributes' pain and despair and not even realize the violence isn't gory until you've left the theater. The movie also deals with important themes like survival, governmental control, grief and helplessness. There is a minor love story subplot, but it doesn't distract from the movies main themes. In my opinion I think it rather improves them by showing some light in the dark.The only complaint I can think of is that the movie feels too short. It's almost two and a half hours long, but it feels as if it goes by in a blink. I will have to see it again to fully pay attention to every detail (such as the costumes and animation of the Capitol, which looked amazing). But this is still not me saying that the movie is rushed, because as I stated the source material is very dense and the filmmakers managed include almost everything.People are expecting this to become the next Twilight-style teen movie franchise. I can't say I think the two stories have anything in common even though I hope \"The Hunger Games\" will do as well at the box office. But if the first movie is any indication of the quality of what's to come - this will be a series way out of Twilight's league.",
    "89": "I should tell you right up front that I have never read \"The Hunter Games\"--so this review is more for this group of folks than the die-hard book lovers. In many cases, I have no idea where the book and film differ and my expectations were quite different from my daughter--who has read the series. However, one this that DID bother me is that despite the film's title, no one appeared to be all that hungry in the film and the way food was used to manipulate and control the masses was not explained well. The only way I knew this was that my daughter sat next to me and explained this (and it helps that we both know sign language). But apart from that and the god-awful 'shaky cam\" (one of the WORST inventions in the history of filmmaking), the film was enjoyable and engrossing throughout. As I said, though, the shakiness of the film (especially at the beginning) was a problem--and I felt motion sick just watching the movie! The plot and movie have already been discussed in a bazillion reviews. The film has already been out about 45 days when I saw it tonight, so I don't want to give a lengthy review. Instead, I'll talk about what I liked. Foremost, the acting was really, really nice. I cared about the characters I was supposed to care about and it tore my guts out when one of them was killed in the film--showing what a nice job they did and how well the director elicited the performances. I liked the story a lot--especially since I love dystopian sci-fi films. In many ways it was like combining the original \"Rollerball\" and, perhaps, \"Gladiator\"! It was truly original and kept me riveted. All in all, a terrific film--well worth your time provided you don't mind the violence necessary to convey the story. However, despite the books being very popular with kids, I would think twice about bringing any kids younger than about 12 or 13.]",
    "90": "When a massive movie franchise comes to a close, often a hole can develop in the highly competitive market of Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. Perhaps never before has that hole been as large as the abyss left by the HARRY POTTER series, given the rapid release schedule of those films. It's 2012, and there's no new POTTER. Some might argue that the TWILIGHT series fills the void, yet not only is that franchise little more than a punchline to all but the hardcore fans, it too is set to (hopefully) wrap up this year. Enter THE HUNGER GAMES, seemingly a sure thing based on the POTTER formula: hugely successful series of young adult novels? Check. Talented cast of young leads and respected character actors as support? Naturally. Large scale production and, crucially, marketing budget? You bet. So is THE HUNGER GAMES worthy of taking up the POTTER mantle?Amazingly, it might be even better.While no-one would suggest that THE HUNGER GAMES is the most original new property coming from the Hollywood machine, Lionsgate and director Gary Ross adapt Suzanne Collins' source material in just the right ways, jettisoning un-cinematic elements and focusing on the meat of the story right from the opening frame. Rather than build the world of Panem through tedious exposition and backstory, Ross instead drops us directly into the grim life of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her journey to the Hunger Games, a perverse spectacle inflicted annually on 24 unfortunate teens. While the POTTER series certainly headed in a darker direction as it went on, THE HUNGER GAMES is horrifically bleak right from the get go, and Ross' decision to show instead of tell, through the use of wonderfully expressive, fluid camera-work, paints an ugly picture indeed. There are so many refreshing elements at work here, with an active, independent, and strong female protagonist and a startling absence of overblown CGI, but it's the nastiness that makes this film unique. Delivering a family appropriate experience while retaining the majority of the violence and unpleasantness of the novel is a delicate proposition which Ross mostly pulls off, but one can't help wondering about the potential for a much harder, R-rated cut of the film. It's an understandable issue to be sure, but an issue nonetheless.Where THE HUNGER GAMES perhaps doesn't fare so well is in the internal strife faced by Katniss, particularly in regards to potential love interests Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Collins' novel has much more freedom to explore, and even dwell on, Katniss' emotional state through inner monologue, but given the nature of film, particularly a mainstream blockbuster such as this, much less room is left for introspection, and some of the character dynamics and relationships suffer in comparison. Katniss' independence is unfortunately undercut by the franchise building mentality of the film, setting up an inevitable love triangle to be explored in two potential sequels. That said, she's still a much more positive, appropriate female role model than TWILIGHT's limp and passive Bella Swan, or indeed any young female character in recent memory. THE HUNGER GAMES is an important film at many levels, one which heralds the birth of the next big Hollywood franchise, and if the quality of the first installment is maintained then the sequels can't come soon enough.tinribs27.wordpress.com",
    "91": "I am referring to the audience watching. Because the original Battle Royale (japanese movie) with a similar theme, was more of an adult version of this movie right here. Having said that, the idea is so good it translates to the screen, even if it is watered down a bit. Plus I was just enjoying the girls moaning and exhaling in general while watching this and finding romance even in the weirdest of situations. Throw in Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and the always reliable Stanley Tucci for some acting/weirdness weight and you got yourself a movie.Apparently though the movie has not covered everything the novel had to offer (which should be no surprise). What should be a surprise to anyone who was living outside the US, is the fact, that this was one of the most anticipated movies in recent history (though I'm more than happy that The Avengers beat them at the total box office of course). Better drama, story and acting than Twilight, hopefully it stays that way and won't dwindle down the road ...",
    "92": "In the ruins of what once known was North America, lies the futuristic nation of Panem. In the center of the country is the wealthy Capitol, inhabited by lavish-clothed citizens. Surrounding the rich Capitol is twelve outlying districts, each having a different industry and supplying materials for the Capitol. Some of the districts are wealthy (District 1: Luxury, District 2: Masonry, District 4: Fishing), while some are dead-poor (District 11: Agriculture, District 12: Coal mining).Before the film begins, the 13 districts fought with the Capitol, resulting in catastrophe, but eventually the Capitol won. The aftermath: the 12 districts were forced to annually give in a male and female between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the Hunger Games; the participants are called \"tributes\". The 13th District was, unfortunately, obliterated by the Capitol (sort of).Our heroine is sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen who comes from the poor District 12. She's received tesserae to meet the needs of her suffering family, in exchange for getting her name added additional times for the \"Reaping\" (the time when the names of the participants are randomly picked). When her sister's, Primrose Everdeen, name is unexpectedly drawn during the reaping (despite the fact that her name was only there for once), Katniss volunteers to take her place and enter the Hunger Games, a TV show which forces 24 \"tributes\" to fight to the death as a reminder to the rebellion 74 years ago.The heart of Panem, the Capitol is where the \"tributes\" undergo training (Katniss and Peeta have drunken Haymitch) and several interviews. Here, everything looks different from District 12. \"The showers are different\" (as Peeta says), the buildings are more colorful and the people there are lavishly-clothed. The citizens of the Capitol don't join the Games but they do are responsible for giving sponsors: some sort of gift received by the \"tribute\" during the Games. The sponsors depend on their opinions and these opinions usually depend on the \"tributes'\" scores given by the Gamemakers; each of the \"tributes\" are evaluated by the Gamemakers based on their skills and the higher the scores, the more likely chance they're going to get sponsors. After the evaluation, we get the interviews hosted by the eccentric Caesar Flickerman, and the Games begin in 3 ... 2 ... 1.The 24 \"tributes\" run at once in different directions, some to the tempting backpacks filled with valuable items, some clashing to kill some \"tributes\", some escaping to the wild.Pushing the PG-13 rating to its fullest, the Games do involve blood and some deadly kills. While Katniss and Peeta are relatively quiet, some of the Careers (\"tributes\" who spent their entire lives practicing for the Games) are very brutal especially Cato of District 2. The Careers form a pack to kill the other \"tributes\" first before they kill each other until only one remains. \"The Hunger Games\" is often compared to the \"Twilight\" films. They may have a similarity (a love triangle which places Katniss in the middle of Gale and Peeta), but the main focus of the film is not the love triangle. Katniss originally loved Gale but because of the \"Reaping\", Katniss allied with Peeta Mellark. That's basically what the love triangle covers. The love triangle is only a piece in a larger plot set in the dystopian future surrounding the Hunger Games. The film has an excellent cast. Putting Jennifer Lawrence as our heroine Katniss Everdeen is nothing but perfect. Coming off from an Oscar nomination two years ago, she's one to rise into super stardom. Her performance here is very convincing and very powerful that she deserves an Oscar right there on the spot. Her ability to show rage, nervousness, fear, determination, sadness, is just very spellbinding. John Hutcherson is also one not to be missed. His portrayal of Peeta Mellark is convincing also, being able to display nervousness, and fear. The others were also excellent: Alexander Ludwig plays Cato viciously, and brutally; Woody Harrelson plays the drunk Haymitch perfectly; Stanley Tucci portrays Caesar Flickman with charisma and style; Elizabeth Banks depicts Effie Trinket with meticulous details. The action is another thing the movie excels in. Although there might have not been a lot of intense explosions or \"Kabooms!\", the moments that take place in the Arena are thrilling likewise. The fight is not about action but more about hunting and survival skills. Katniss is relatively quiet, unlike the Careers who are more excited about getting into a fight where they are able to snap people's necks. The film is based on a novel, a novel I enjoyed immensely. With the author Suzanne Collins also playing a part in writing the screenplay, the movie is faithful to the book's contents. Although there are slight alterations, there are no major alterations that might change the course of the plot (such as \"Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief\"). Anyone who has read the books will be pleased with how Gary Ross transformed the book into this film. Not a fan of the books, no problem, you can still enjoy this film. In other words, anyone can enjoy the film. Rating: 9/10Final Verdict: \"The Hunger Games\" is an action-packed drama that lives up to its massive hype and can be enjoyed by anyone.",
    "93": "I am using a somewhat popular blogging platform (not google's) for workspace on a project I'm running on cinematic abstraction. I am not into the social aspect of it, though I have developed contacts. It just offers appealing options in the code. Now and then, as a kind of smoke break, I switch from personal work on my dashboard to the general stream of published content. I mostly filter for cinema, so suppose I am blocking out a lot of junk, but still, being able to tune in that channel of youthful stream-of-consciousness allows for some pretty cool observations.The age of average user in that place seems to be below twenty. They blog and reblog like crazy, with new posts arriving every minute. The level is several notches above Twitter, and predominantly visual. It goes beyond 'liking' something, to putting together some attractive personality. Items that get a lot of traction, within what is filtered by me, include fashion, urban nightscape photography, Sofia Coppola, everything tagged Dali and surrealism. There is the occasional Walt Whitman quote followed by pictures of waffles or movie stars.So, spending quite a bit of time with (partially) the target-group for this film, I have to report: a sizable portion of our youth is not dumb and desensitized, it seems to me, they may be melodramatic (youth seldom isn't), but they are curious, alert, visual creatures. They are looking for art that teases the imagination. In ten years time, some of them are going to be commendable artists. So, if I'm being honest, I would be much, much more accepting of something like this, if it was a spontaneous, say collaborative project generated by teenagers from that community. The focus would have been largely the same, I'm sure: stifled passions, cruel , dystopic adult world. But the personality?What we have here is that adults in the high corporate levels have made many of the same remarks, and here is the shrewd business plan: nicely package teenage dynamics inside the visual culture that consumes and defines them. It's a smart move, and this is the most acutely aware of the recent crop, so much so it makes (the first) Twilight seem naive and old Hollywood.What does this mean? The film is made from a lot of spare parts, as though reblogged (Battle Royale is only the most recent and obvious). It is shot as a fast-moving stream of visual snippets that is not at all the Bourne effect: the idea here is less the first-person character experience, and more of a comfortable cognitive map for a young audience growing up on internet and instant interconnectivity. It takes place in a world that venerates spectacle and celebrity, with the Gamers paraded around 'tinseltown' like the hottest new MTV stars. The battleground arena is filmed by hundreds of cameras that instantly connect everywhere, including the skies.So far so good, an effectively aligned version of contemporary pop culture. The action once it kicks in is formulaic, but that is because the guys running this have no imagination: you can observe the director of the Games and his team of assistants, every decision they make to affect the gameflow, instead of perhaps intelligently structuring the situation is absolutely contrived and geared for special-effects: most of all, nondescript monsters to speed-up the finale. The artistic personality, since every decision is of an artistic nature, is simply unappealing.But, here's the catch that entirely sinks this: like a bunch of smarmy, Victorian-era schoolteachers, adults responsible for this - the 'sponsors' for the event - couldn't resist imposing on the teenage playground fun with a combination of finger-wagging, 1984-style fearmongering about the future, and sensationalized movie-treatment of suffering.The film was designed in the vein of, hinges its entire appeal, and probably used every channel of that visual culture to access an audience, then turns around and claims that culture is decadent, exploits and degrades. Moreover, it attempts, this multimillion dollar product, to remind us that outside of the comfortably-numb limits of reality TV and the internet, in the real world out there persists hunger, inequality, and poverty. The lead is played by a girl who two years ago in Winter's Bone had to eke out a miserable existence in southern Missouri, another clue of short-sighted imagination, casting her because she was good there. The downbeat scenario is replicated whole here, including the killing of squirrels for food.In other words: \"sit down in the multiplex to have fun with this thing you have seen advertised on TV and across the internet, while we lecture with important statements on the state of the world.\"If I was sixteen now, maybe I wouldn't know it, but I believe that younger self would deserve much better. So if you are that age and looking for something that nourishes with rejection, I would turn you over to something like Godard's Breathless or Harmony Korine's Gummo: rebellious films made by young filmmakers in the effort to capture a little something of what it means to live in the world. Breathless (conventionally) popularized the jump-cut that is the main device here, but was using it as a breach with established ways of seeing. It was radical in its time, and you deserve something radical in yours.This is the 'sponsored' version, where adults take your money while pretending to educate.",
    "94": "So as a movie enthusiast and a Cineworld unlimited card holder i do my fair share of visits to the cinema. Of course when a film garners interest the trailers become more and more prominent; this could be said for the newly released \"Hunger Games:Catching Fire\". Constant trailers and advertisements on TV....which led me to think...well i haven't even seen the first one yet. This led me to take up the opportunity that CineWorld had put before me, in seeing the first film in the Cinema in a one day special showing of the 2012 blockbuster...........but oh how i wish i didn't. Fast Forward to the end of the film and i walk out wondering what all the fuss is about and ahead of me i see an ever growing queue outside of anxious teens awaiting the midnight showing of the sequel. And it hit me like a bullet. This is why there is so much hype. I mean there could be no better an example of teen power than the Twilight saga. And this is very similar. Has any of these nutters seen \"Battle Royale\"? That is how you do a film focused on individual survival. That is a film that shows you the depths people will go to survive. It doesn't hide from the violence and it doesn't over complicate it. It is live or die. Simple.Now this farce of a film is more focused on creating a love triangle between Katnis, (Lawrence) Gale (Hemsworth) and Peeta (Hutcherson). All this district nonsense, all this sacrifice, all the deaths...just for a love triangle. That is what the underlying story and forthcoming films are going to be all about; twilight anyone? It is one of the cheesiest films ever; made me cringe so much i was almost sure my spine would snap at any moment. That my head would go all exorcist and just keep going when i constantly turned away in dismay. This film is successful because of the vast amount of teens who are vacuumed into love stories and won't let go until a shirt is taken off. And anyone over the age of 18 who still enjoys this needs to grow up and go watch Battle Royale and that'll show you what would really happen in a circumstance like this.The film takes almost an hour to start and when it does start, it actually doesn't. It's slow, uneventful and the characters they try so hard for you to feel sympathy towards are so incredibly unimportant that you simply don't care.Yet another film, that is over exaggerated, over hyped, over advertised and over the top with cheese.2/10 (and that's me being nice)",
    "95": "An unfortunate catalyst that propelled the trend of teenage protagonist led book adaptations, of dystopian futures. Divergent and Maze Runner followed, both failing to complete their respective stories. Perhaps that has tainted the memory of a satisfactory film, undefinable by genre.It's easy to forget that way back in 2012 this was fresh and new, tonally dark cinema, aiming for the teenage demographic. Perhaps that's a large reason for the success of the franchise, it was new and interesting, everything since has just been a rehash, located in a different world.Refreshingly dark and mature, visually graphic, The Hunger Games has a lot going for it, as a visual spectacle, not so much as an immersive and compelling story. Narratively it meanders, without intent, there's a station to arrive at but not the train track to get there. Tonally gloomy at times, balance is hard to find. Switches in mood make the texture of the atmosphere uneven, because changes are jarring and misplaced. The edit failed to maximise the potential seeping throughout. Scenes are drawn out and end on odd notes, something that could've been tightened up in post-production. Additionally more cuts to and through between the Games and the world at present would've helped to increase tension while the story pondered, the scale and public reaction isn't documented anywhere near enough, if at all. Personally I feel the editing really trips this film up, it's quite easily 10-15 minutes too long, feeling even longer due to the fact of how much sitting around there is.Stretched so far it's see through, the ending is blatant from the get go, meaning there's not much to keep you interested after the half hour mark.Gary Ross shows wonderful craft and delicacy when concerning the dark themes of oppressed society, life without choice and just how bleak living in a dictatorship is. In the first act he manages to craft a tone and atmosphere that reeks of desperation, fear, the empty void of hopelessness and life without control. Yet he lifts the mood with the slightest and smallest of scenes between Kat and Gale, serving as a reminder of humanity's ability to dream and aspire for a better world. Each shot set in District 12 is delightful, sombre chills run through every vein as you are enraptured in fear and anxiety. The build up to and throughout the reaping is tense and nauseating, interactions with Kat and her sister are filmed so preciously. Sound is well utilised through the overdrawn run-time, music is allowed to overrun and dominate, drowning out the world perfectly and symbolically. An example that comes to mind concerning the sound is when Kat offers herself up, her screaming juxtaposed against the silence sets her out from the rest, nailing her on as the protagonist we will all route for. Selfless.This was Jennifer Lawrence's big break in the public eye, she left a good impression. Portrayed with care, Katniss is delicately played when is necessary but can easily surge with passion when needed. Reminiscent of an indie film portrayal, Jennifer showcases her range and hits all the marks, and you, in all the right places.Hunger Games starts off brilliantly, it's exhilarating and tense, filled with subtlety. Has a terrific lead performance that powers you through. It's weighed down by an underwhelming narrative, that's evened out with an enjoyable character arc. Sadly it gets wrapped up in it itself, losing its awareness of how sick a situation this is, and rather than point it out, chooses to accept the societal issues, it so cleverly addressed in the beginning. We then drift and chunder toward the inevitable ending.Nevertheless I'd quite happily re-watch the first act, but would have no qualms with skipping the rest.It's a solid piece of film-making.",
    "96": "Not comparing this to Battle Royale is impossible - the premise is too similar to be ignored. I'm extremely biased as well, considering Battle Royale is one of my all-time favorite films/books/graphic novels. So let's get this rant out of the way: The Hunger Games takes the concept of Battle Royale and waters it down to a product more accessible to a wider audience, specifically the younger crowd. My biggest problem with this is it loses the impact of Battle Royale - a frightening, beautiful, orgiastic display of shocking violence and social commentary. What makes it so twisted is that the contestants are all fellow students and friends, and we get to know many of the students, making their deaths more disturbing. In The Hunger Games, we follow two contestants and the rest are nameless, and with the exception of one young black girl, their deaths are meaningless (and mostly off-screen). The fact that the violence is so much more tame seems irresponsible - we don't see how horrific and terrifying it would be. The characters in The Hunger Games are black-and-white, good and evil with no grey areas, whereas the characters in Battle Royale feature heroes, antiheroes, complete monsters, and terrified teens. They're plunged into a situation and act like normal teens would, freaking out, committing suicide, going ax crazy, professing love, etc.As a film, The Hunger Games is certainly not bad - it's a well-made, well-acted spectacle that is entertaining albeit predictable. It takes its time getting to the action, but when the contestants are finally released it's thrilling (there's also a particularly intense scene involving a wasp's nest). It's probably the best we can expect from what a predictable Hollywood remake of Battle Royale would look like - significantly toned down, with a gorgeous cast, and a soundtrack featuring Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, and a couple good indie bands (as opposed to Battle Royale's classical music). I also like that The Hunger Games focuses more on the media aspect of the game, which was mostly ignored in Battle Royale. It's much less melodramatic than Battle Royale as well. The bizarre costume designs are great too.TL;DR - It all comes down to taste. If you prefer fantasy stories, don't like subtitles, and have no desire to see kids kill each other in over-the-top gory fashion, you'll like The Hunger Games. If you're a fan of horror, exploitation, or extreme Asian cinema, you'll like Battle Royale. I prefer the latter, but The Hunger Games could've been a lot worse.",
    "97": "\"The Hunger Games\" was an instant hit when it came out, so I'm pretty sure I'm the last person in this universe to see it. Unfortunately, it sorta felt like I was wasting my time. The movie seemed like equal parts \"Running Man\", \"The Truman Show\" and \"Battle Royale\", but with all the clever elements from either of those movies removed. I don't get a kick out of gratuitous violence or something, but spending the first hour on build-up that will barely have any effect on the plot is looooooooong. Take for example all the scenes where they have to impress possible sponsors (to provide outside help) with their fighting skill, sponsoring comes into play so rarely later on that all those scenes are completely cuttable. During the actual hunger game/battle royale, you still don't get much of an action or adventure movie. They're after pulling heart strings mostly, including the incredibly stretched-out death scene of a character we literally know NOTHING about (a full action-free hour wasn't enough to establish some traits?). The most bothersome thing about the movie though it how freaking convenient everything is. Our main cardboard cutouts (granted, Jennifer Lawrence does the best she can with the material) are up against highly trained manhunters, heavily bleeding and leaving traces all over the forest. How do they not die on the first day? How does nobody spot them when they stand there crying and screaming in a wide-open space? Some other character lights a small fire and is killed within about three seconds, but I guess you can't act stupid if you're not important to the plot. The main characters don't survive because they're so strong, so creative, so quick or so fearless: they survive because the script says so. Therefor there's barely any tension, you can predict everything beat for beat. Given its massive success this movie's got to have lots of appeal, but it must have missed me by a mile.",
    "98": "Okay, you may not believe me, or even call me a simple liar, but I was brought by some friends of mine to a special screening of \"The Hunger Games\" in an almost-hidden Mondoplex here in Hawaii. I read the books and I saw the trailer, I thought it looked a little boring, but then...I saw the movie. TO be honest, I wanted to see it twice. It is certainly the 2nd. best movie I've ever seen in my life! The acting was superb, realistic and meagerly emotional. The fights were, ha-ha, super violent and action-packed and I'll tell you: THERE WILL BE BLOOD! Yet, this is an awesome movie, with lots of special effects and lots of combat sequences, that just kept me on the border of my seat. Really, 9.9/10. It is really 142 mins. long but you will be unprepared for this masterpiece and you will be entertaine whatsoever!We literally have a simple winner. THE HUNGER GAMES is one of the most irresistible, epic, beautiful, suspenseful and iconic masterpiece that will surely not let you down at any point! Instead of watching another cheesy vampire/human romance and investing money on the same, old crap of the usuality, go for this!",
    "99": "In Shirley Jackson's \"The Lottery\" (1948), regarded as one of the most famous short stories in American literature, someone in a small rural town is selected by lottery to engage in the center of a yearly ritual which will cleanse the town of its sins. \"The Hunger Games\" presents a similar compelling premise. In the world of Panem, there is one Capitol and 12 districts. Before the events of the story, there were 13 districts which eventually rose up in rebellion, led by District 13. The Capitol was able to put down the rebellion, and District 13 was razed to the ground. However, the rebellion was not the end of the story, and the current dictator of Panem upholds a yearly tradition to remind the remaining districts of their violent past, called \"the Dark Days\".As punishment for the rebellion and as a reminder of who's \"in charge\", the Capitol hosts a violent pageant every year. Twenty-four young people of pre-college age are chosen by lottery to participate in the pageant; one boy and one girl from each district. The plot is a dark take on reality television contests: the pageant, called \"The Hunger Games\", requires the 24 tributes (they're not called contestants) engage in a fight-to-the-death contest in a wilderness-like arena controlled by unseen technicians in a war room of sorts. Only one tribute can be declared the winner at the end of the games, essentially requiring the other 23 tributes to perish. The games are broadcast on large screens so members of each district can watch the fates of their representatives. The event is hosted by a television game-show host/MC, Claudius Templesmith (Stanley Tucci), who makes Richard Dawson (of Family Feud fame) seem like a high-cultured gentleman. \"And may the odds be ever in your favor!\" is the motto of the Games.Of the 12 remaining districts, District 12 is the poorest, made up of primarily miners and other blood-and-sweat workers. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a teen girl who has self-taught herself to use the bow to hunt for game and sell in the town. On Tribute Day, all the youth from age 12 to 18 are brought to the town square where Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), a resident of the Capitol who, like many of her colleagues, enjoys wearing garish and flamboyant outfits, hosts the lottery ceremony. She picks Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields), Katniss' sister to participate. Katniss, stunned, offers to volunteer for the Games in her sister's stead. Since this is the first time someone has ever volunteered, the proposition is accepted by the State. The other tribute from District 9 is Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson).Katniss and Peeta are chaperoned by Effie Trinket to the Capitol on a bullet train. There they meet their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a winner of the Hunger Games many years previously. He is there to help train and instruct Katniss and Peeta, but his highest priority seems to be drinking and snoozing. Eventually, Katniss and Peeta with interesting finesse convince Abernathy that they are worth helping.Once at the Capitol, they are paraded in front of the elite residents who cheer and decide which tributes they wish to root for. The tributes are then brought to a training facility, being told not to \"hurt\" any of the other tributes. They say there will be plenty of time for violent engagement relatively soon! They are treated like celebrities about to embark on a fashion pageant, being given beautiful outfits to wear during interviews. Of course, everyone knows the outcome of the pageant means 23 of the 24 tributes will not survive. Eventually, on the fateful day, the 24 tributes are transported to the arena-wilderness area where food and weapons are strewn about which can be used to better someone's chances. We also learn that the game is also \"rigged\". The control room doesn't just monitor the tributes but has power to influence situations. There are also \"sponsors\", Capitol residents, who can aid tributes they like. This story has become more relevant with the rise of \"fake news\" and distrust of television journalism with distorted media.Overall, a well-done and impassioned view of a bleak future which rings of Orwell's \"1984\" and the 1970's cult classic \"Roller Ball\". In \"Roller Ball\" two teams donning skates battle each other on a rink. In the final game, players can only leave the game if they're killed, which is essentially the same idea as \"The Hunger Games\". The film finds a good balance between the heartlessness of the competition (if competition it can be called) and the emotions of the characters. At one point, Katniss befriends a young African-American girl, Rue (Amandla Stenberg), who is obviously too young to be part of the games. They become allies to help each other defend against another \"gang\" who desires to kill them. One of the most touching and poignant moments of the film is their friendship and Rue's fate.",
    "100": "I have to admit at first glance, going by the trailers that have been incessantly playing since late last year, that this was nothing more than a Battle Royale rip off, having teenagers put into an arena and fighting to the death. Such genre films have been done countless of time, from the days of Schwarzeneggar in his The Running Man, to even Stone Cold Steve Austin in The Condemned, where everyone becomes gladiators and essentially television content fodder, and The Hunger Games surely contained the exact same elements too. But what excelled and stood this film from its peers, boils back to Collins' superbly set up story, and in Gary Ross' focused direction that never leaves the film soulless, filling it with plenty of heart and got the audience to emotionally invest in its protagonist from the get go.And that is something Gary Ross, going by his filmography such as Seabiscuit and Pleasantville, does quite effortlessly, with a story that's set in a fictional period where much of the known world is divided into districts to suppress an uprising decades ago, where each district, living in hunger and in fear, have to cough out a teenage boy and girl each between the ages of 12 to 18 every year as tribute to battle in The Hunger Games, a fight to the last, that is also broadcast live in a television show. The arena is at The Capitol where the elites live amongst armed protection, and the combatants duke it out in an arena of faux pas natural habitat that can be manipulated at will by designers.What set this out from the rest is that it has a female protagonist who is not a useless, or whining damsel in distress. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a hunter and provider for her family, volunteering as tribute in place of her sister Primrose (Willow Shields), and together with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), they become the tributes from District 12. We spend the first hour unhurried in painting the background set for the entire trilogy, so much so that not everything got explained, which was a sly move to leave out unessential details at this point for the other sequels to follow up on, especially the need to know more about the current state of the world. We're left to concentrate on a series of unfolding events around Katniss, as well as to get to know the reclusive girl who has to learn how to milk her popularity to increase her chances of survival.While it's essentially Battle Royale, there are the necessary tweaks to the rules of the game to keep it unique, such as the introduction of sponsors and external assistance. Katniss also had to rely on a lot of luck, and isn't your superhero Rambo from the onset, making her believable, identifiable, and with qualities in a character that you would root for. Even her skill with the bow doesn't make her a deadly shot all the time, as things like anxiety and fear make her character all the more believable, and human. Pacing was kept just right especially after the hour mark when the games kick into gear, although one complaint will be that since this is a teenage flick, you do not get to see the gory details of teen killing teen, no thanks to the deliberate cinematography to keep thing shaky, out of focus and never within comfortable depth of field. After all, this is supposed to be PG-13 stuff for the mass market, so everything's kept at a level that Walt Disney himself will approve.Still, it's not about the violence and the deaths, but a lot more about the theme of survival, with the story going a lot more for collaboration and cooperation, even amongst allies and alliances formed amongst the strong to pick on the meek. Subplots included in the film all hint at stories that the next two installments will pick up on, such as Katniss' growing popularity amongst the districts and her becoming the icon of rebellion that you'd know will be dealt with even without reading the books. Romance also finds time to creep into the storyline, especially since an engineered one starts to become a little bit more real, and setting up an uncomplicated love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and the former's best friend in Gale (Liam Hemsworth) who had sworn to protect and provide for her family while she's away competing to return home.And the supporting ensemble cast consists of notables such as Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrelson as pro-Katniss supporters, or at least those who have to stand at her corner during her preparation for the Games, and others such as Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones as television personalities, Wes Bentley as the primary gamemaster, and Donald Sutherland as President Snow, everyone veterans in their own right propping up the relative newcomers who take on primary roles in this expected franchise. Amongst those who stood out are Banks, almost unrecognizable in her makeup and costumes, and Tucci who hams it up as a television host.The Hunger Games have got me hooked despite getting off on the wrong footing during its marketing, and I am as eager as many new found fans out there who are anticipating what's next in the story. It may be tame, but Katniss is a fresh female protagonist who will have you hooked to her cause, and that alone is this film's strength that it played up superbly. Recommended!",
    "101": "When The Hunger Games came out, all non-book fans could think of was Asian flick Battle Royale of which I think is an okay but forgettable movie. Meanwhile, the concept of a televised people vs. people contest always reminded me of Arnie nostalgia-classic The Running Man. In retrospect, it's a pretty cheesy movie, but its execution with all its 80s gritty excess makes the idea chilling and believable in its dystopian world. My biggest problem with The Hunger Games is that never once did I feel the concept fit the world. I think it's a pretty good setup with the idea of a uprising that didn't work and that the upper class would punish them but with a kid v. kid battle to the death? There's something about the film that never once convinced me and it lost me right from the outset.Perhaps this is because the film so far removed from our world that there's no relatable one. On one hand, there's the districts which feel like a cleaned up Deadwood then there's the Baz Lurhman does Dr. Seuss civilized world. There's no believable sense of time transition from how it can get to its opening written setup to this world with its infrequent odd sci-fi flashes. It's trying too hard to have social commentary. Above all there's no heart beyond teenage angsty feelings and no sense of a morality we can relate to - albeit, Stanley Tucci was a delight and I wish he could host everything ever. Yeah, Jennifer Lawrence's protagonist is brave and I supported her but the writing was so underdeveloped that I found myself confused at what she was or wasn't doing a lot of the time.The film is just so contrived to try and force the concept to belong in this world. The plot is relatively easy to follow but there's way too many times when I found myself asking \"why are they doing this?\" without explanation and \"why don't they just do this?\" without ruling the alternatives out. I feel like the film never took a moral stance on the killings. Sure, the civilized world find it entertaining/punishment and the Deadwood world finds it tragic, fine, but I'm interested in the internal feelings of the ones actually involved. It just felt like their plan was \"to win\" but strategies were never revealed. Why didn't they just slaughter everyone while they were \"training\" with all the weapons? If they weren't allowed, why didn't the film demonstrate it beyond the few words \"don't fight here\"? I never bought it.Maybe their plan was to just survive the best they could and stay hidden, but this was never stated. Why were people making alliances when there could only be one winner? It never made any sense, especially when there was absolutely no character development. Perhaps this is what you get with a film that's about the one thing it can't show with a PG-13 rating and shaky cam. I imagine these kinds of morality and strategy things are in the book and fans are just filling in these gaps by themselves, but The Hunger Games movie just confused and bored me with its slow plot-hole ridden script, unpleasant hook and unsatisfying climax. Give me The Running Man for the dozenth time instead, at least it has a bit of balls when it comes to its action.4/10",
    "102": "It's a shame how one aspect can spoil the entire experience but that's what happened for me. Other reviewers have commented on the use of hand-held shaky-cam, fast-cut camera-work - none of them positively that I can find.From the Trivia section on IMDb we read this one sentence:---- The director has stated that his decision to go with shaky cam work, \"had a lot to do with the urgency of what's going on and to reflect protagonist Katniss Everdeen's point of view.\" ----There was nothing \"urgent\" about the first 2/3rds of the film. I'm glad I don't go around throwing my head from side-to-side in normal life, stressed or not. When are film-makers going to realise they are the only ones that truly like this type of camera-work? They sit there editing the film on their desktop monitors in an office but faithful movie-goers have to watch their \"creativity\" on 50ft+ screens, where every sudden jerk sideways is at best distracting, at worst nauseating. It doesn't convey urgency, it conveys amateurism. Enough already.Hitchcock asked the composer Friedhofer, \"where would the orchestra be?\" when the latter wanted a string piece for a scene in \"Lifeboat\" The composer replied \"The same place as the cameraman.\" We expect movies to have a soundtrack, and if the music is working properly, then we don't really notice it because it joins in with the visuals and enhances the scene. We are viewers of make-believe, sometimes realistic, often fantastical, and immersion into the world of the story is key to a satisfying movie-going experience. A camera being wiggled about on purpose draws attention to itself, and it shouldn't. This constant reminder of the presence of a, seemingly badly trained cameraman, is a real turn-off. Please stop it.As far as the other aspects of the film were concerned, I found the narrative somewhat plodding, and the pre-games section of the film could have done with being 20-30mins shorter. I knew nothing about the books beforehand, so I'm of the opinion that this is perhaps one for the S.Collins enthusiast rather than the general movie-goer. Though if the other reviews are anything to go by, plenty of Collins' readers are not very pleased either!",
    "103": "Katniss Everdeen agrees to take up her sister's place in the deadly Hunger Games, a sacrificial game which puts youngsters from different districts against one another, there can only be one survivor.I wanted to read the book before watching the film, and reviewing it, and I know I'm a little late to the party, but I quite enjoyed it.It's a fairly hyped up film, and I'm not surprised that another sequel is set to land in cinemas soon.I think it's a little slow to start, but it gets better as soon as Katniss enters the games, it definitely gets more action packed and moves at a quicker pace.There's a definite social message here, it takes aim at a society that's desperate for thrills and spills, one that enjoys the suffering of others.Sets and costumes look pretty great, pretty much as I imagine from the books, very stylish, and a whole new world is conceived, and looks pretty good.The standout aspect for me is Jennifer Lawrence, she stands tall among a very strong cast.A good debut movie.7/10.",

    "105": "After last year's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 famously hammered the nail in the coffin of the beloved Potter franchise, many avid teenage readers and moviegoers searched frantically for another dependably exciting adventure series to fill the aching, gaping hole that was left after the worldwide heartbreak. The fact that many of them believe that they've found it with Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games will, it seems, mitigate the power of what is really an inspired, intelligent, brilliantly crafted fable and provide egoistic film critics with the perfect ammunition to blast away the threat to their vain conservatism. This should never have really been a series, because it works on the same level as other eerie futuristic pieces such as George Orwell's fascinating 1984 or Ridley Scott's rickety but well-intentioned Blade Runner (1982). Books or films belonging to a pre-mediated fantasy or science fiction series usually end quite inconclusively and mysteriously, with a neat explanation being provided in the final instalment. This perfectly packaged ending is made possible by the disconnect from the real world, but The Hunger Games is very much focused on harsh realities and palpable, relatable ambiguities, or at least it was until the sequel Catching Fire was published in 2009. The main premise of the story might have been typical of teenage entertainment – yet nevertheless exciting – but the insightful earlier and later passages are what set it apart from mainstream blockbuster entertainment.As most people know, the story centres on young Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who struggles to support her family and to cope personally in a brutal dystopian future. She lives in the last of twelve strictly separated districts that get progressively poorer, although each has been oppressed severely by the Capitol, particularly after the great insurrection that occurred several decades before Katniss' birth. This is where one of the story's most unique aspects comes in, in that the violent and passionate rebellion that usually takes centre stage in these stories has come and gone unsuccessfully, and has had adverse effects on the later generations. Now, every year, the Capitol draws names out of a ballot and takes a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18, gives them a brief bit of training and places them all in an arena in a gruelling fight to the death that becomes a twisted reality television show for the entire population. Katniss volunteers as a tribute after her fragile, 12-year-old sister is called up, along with the humble and kindly Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) who is just as convinced that he will lose because of his useless fighting skills as he is that Katniss will win because of her determination and hunting experience, and is eager for them to pose as \"star-crossed lovers\" in order to gain publicity and extra assistance from sponsors.What follows is their navigation of a perilous moral, philosophical, physical and emotional minefield whilst they try to find a balance between staying true to themselves and their personal beliefs, even if it means defying the Capitol, and being strategic and adaptable enough to survive. It would be a very laborious task to describe the many details of these rich plot developments, but due mention must go to a few of the most intriguing characters, and the actors that so impressively embody them. Liam Hemsworth effectively plays the supporting character of Gale, Katniss' best friend, who always optimistically insists that they should flee to the forest to live as nature intended and be free of the Capitol. He is just as likable as Peeta, and both are naïve and coldly realistic in their own way. 12- year-old newcomer Amandla Stenberg beautifully captures the innocence and cheekiness of Rue, a gentle but elusive young tribute who is incredibly adept at climbing. Jack Quaid, another newcomer, somehow manages to mask his natural warmth in order to play an insufferably pompous yet undeniably tough and dangerous competitor from the wealthier area of district 1, where tributes are fiercely trained from a young age and volunteer with pleasure to slaughter the poorer citizens. As for Katniss herself, the still unsteady Jennifer Lawrence has proved to be the perfect casting choice. Our heroine is very similar to her Oscar- nominated role in Winter's Bone (2010) and no doubt she's used many of the same characterisation techniques to portray this tough, earthy yet very sympathetic character, but here she has refined her acting skills enough to make the audience like her as well as the Academy. Josh Hutcherson has also been very well cast as Peeta, being very believable and incredibly moving. It is a pleasure to see him still acting well and prominently after his terrific efforts as a child actor in the last decade, and hopefully he will make the transition to serious adult actor. Lenny Kravitz portrays another powerfully sympathetic character, Cinna, the only Capitol official who recognises the cruelty and harshness of the Hunger Games and extends a gentle, helping hand towards Katniss. Indeed, the upper class is a ghastly sight. Respected actors Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones and Elizabeth Banks stagger on screen as outrageously dressed, ridiculously drunk, shamelessly shallow and often shockingly heartless bureaucrats that appear to be caricatures at first glance, but eventually one realises that as far as representations of government officials go they couldn't be more realistic.A story such as this could never have a concrete ending and remain believable, and unfortunately, by giving it an ending across two sequels, Suzanne Collins has ruined this marvellous fable's chances of ever being taken seriously by anyone over the age of twenty. Still, make sure you experience this fantastic book and film.",
    "106": "I loved it! Having not read the books, and not really knowing what the hell it was about, i dragged my man along and we both thought it was a great movie, me more than him I guess, but he still watched it with me again recently when it came out on DVD.I read all 3 books after I first saw it, and yes there are some plot holes and unexplained things when looking back at the movie, but so what. You cannot possibly put everything from the book in the movie, it would end up being 5 hours long. The only thing that could have been done differently to fill some of the plot holes is made Katniss the narrator, but even after never having read the books before the movie I honestly didn't really get confused. The only thing that could have been explained a bit better was why Gales name was put in 42 times, and Prim's once. The character of Katniss was perfectly cast. Which is just as well because her character was in almost every scene and it was essential that they found the right girl to play her. The haunted look in her eyes, I really believed every emotion she was feeling, and felt so sorry for her. I felt sorry for all the kids. What a horrible world where this is what provides entertainment to the rich folk. Kids killing kids, all for the joy and amusement of others. When they first went into the arena I thought it was going to be a small field and it would be all over in five minutes.All of the actors were great though. I loved Josh Hutcherson is Bridge to Terabithia, but when he popped up on screen in the Hunger Games he was all grown up and a bit of a hottie. And after reading the books, he portrays Peeta perfectly.I hated the characters from Districts 1 and 2, what horrible kids, did they realise only one person could survive in the end, they were acting like they were going to emerge as the final four.Did anyone else think Prim looked like a young, blonde Winona Ryder?Anyway, fantastic movie, and the camera jumping around didn't bother me in the slightest.",
    "107": "\"Various Games\" is a film with a child-juvenile structure but that seeks maturity not in its violence, but in its political framing. Following is better developed, but in this first one everything is simpler, we feel that the film could be much bigger if it had more budget, but the direction is competent with the invested budget, makeup and costumes are great, the special effects are not spectacular but work, what bothers me a lot is the direction of photography, which contrasts a lot with the film's special effects.The adaptation of the book is good, much smoother of course, but it transports the peripheral characters and the entire context of the plot well, one point for the film is the cast, if we care much more about the characters in the film because of the great acting and Extremely charismatic characters, in terms of acting, Jennifer Lawrence acts very well, although it is the least charismatic character, an actor who delivers a very good performance, despite little appearance is Donald Sutherland who plays President Snow.\"Hunger Games\" had a premise, being the new teen phenomenon only more mature than the previous big franchises, it didn't, but it was a phenomenon nonetheless, and it was a better movie than its competitors and postulant as a crowd favorite at the time. . 7/10.",
    "108": "I always wonder after seeing a movie where I have read the book beforehand, \"Would I have liked this better had I not read the book?\" Anybody who has read a book later turned into a film is naturally going to be biased concerning the story. They know how much deeper the material goes, the character back stories, and the scenes which did not make the final cut. They may still critique the filmmaking objectively, but not the story/plot.I read The Hunger Games before seeing the movie. I know that in Panem, an all controlling fascist regime based out of the Capital controls 12 districts in an extremely oppresive manner. In District 12, the proletariat meagerly scrapes by through mining coal and make up for the rest of their harsh existence through scavenging and bartering. To atone for a previous rebellion, every year each District must send one male and female aged 12-18 to the Capital to fight each other to the death. These are the Hunger Games.Katniss Eberwine (Jennifer Lawrence), at 16 years old, is her family's breadwinner. After her father was killed in a mining accident, her mother sunk into a sort of catatonic shock, so Katniss was forced to use her hunting and archery skills to eke out a minimal existence for her mother and her younger sister. It is technically illegal to hunt outside the District's wire perimeter, but Katniss is adept at evading the sensors and also has a partner in crime with her friend Gael (Liam Hemsworth).On Hunger Games selection day, known as the Reaping, Katniss's small 12 year old sister, Primrose, is selected against all odds. In an act of selfless protection, Katniss jumps forward to volunteer in her place. Joining her on the stage as the male representative is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the baker's son and somewhat of an acquaintance of Katniss. Also along for the ride is District 12's Capital representative Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and a drunken former Hunger Games winner, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), who will serve as the mentor for Katniss and Peeta in the games.This plot description sounds a bit thin but it is truly intriguing. The idea of 24 teenagers running around the woods spearing each other with swords, arrows, or even their bare hands has a particular voyeuristic element to it. Unfortunately, to make sure they wrenched all of the millions they could out of the audience, the filmmakers kept this at the PG-13 level. The violence and ensuing deaths just look silly at this sanitized level. Unlike the book, the dread is absent. Furthermore, the characters are stock and one-dimensional; yes, as opposed to the book.In the novel, Peeta's motivations and back story concerning Katniss are finely woven into the story and given a lot of weight. However, in the film, you cannot guess if he is sincere or just trying to play the game. In the book, little Rue (Amandla Stenberg) is a very young and tiny waif from the agricultural district whose impact is deeply felt by the reader. In the movie, Rue fills her requisite squares, but fails to make anywhere near the same impact. I am not sure quite where to put my finger on it, but there is something really missing from this movie.No character gets their due. What I mean is, the plot is faithfully followed, but there is no oomph, no driving force. Katniss comes the closest, but that is just because she is in almost every scene. Jennifer Lawrence has done a very good job here bringing Katniss to life and making her appear scared for her life, which she truly is. Just before her platform rises to begin the Hunger Games, she visibly shakes with fear. Lawrence was even better in Winter's Bone where she really turned in a mesmerizing performance. The biggest disappointments are Panem's dictator and Peeta. These two characters could have added so much depth to what is actually a very light and breezy Hunger Games. If you are familiar with this story, light and breezy should be the last two adjectives which come to mind.A film should be judged on its own irrespective of whether or not you have read its original material. In that respect, The Hunger Games is a very creative story which is underserved by its meek script and borderline boring filmmaking. Material of this caliber (and budget) deserves so much more.",
    "109": "I guess I'm just not in sync with popular teenage culture, because I kind of liked this film, but, based on the number of negative user reviews, you'd think everyone would have dismissed this thing as the next \"Gili\". Well, it is a teenage action adventure romp that skews female, so there's bound to be some disappointment among young male audience members.But, to the film. One wonders if Miss Collins, author of the series, ever read Frederic Brown, or watched classic Star Trek in the late 1960s or during its syndication run in the 70s and 80s, because the basic bulk of the story is taken right out of \"Arena\" (which also saw reincarnation via an issue of \"Adam Strange\" in Detective Comics). Which is okay, because it's not a clone of the story, but uses the basic plot and story written by Brown, and adds many young person and female flourishes to comment on contemporary TV watching habits, and societies' imperilment of becoming addicted to a certain type of bloodletting entertainment.The film is nicely paced, and seems to be riding a fine line of trying to be edgy, real, and young person's fair all at the same time. I think it achieves this for the bulk of the audience whose dollars they're trying to capture, but the rough and tumble sci-fi gamer who is used to blood and gore via an online gaming server (and I'm talking pre-teen boys here) might probably get little impatient with it. But, the young ladies in tonight's audience, seemed to really connect with the film.Some critiques here; in the original \"Arena\" we had Captain James T. Kirk pitted against a very fake looking intelligent lizard-captain, with the goal being for said starship captains to finish each other off in a \"more civil\" manner, as opposed to creating a mess in space via starship combat. In \"Hunger Games\" the main characters must fight for a dystopic world, again to avoid a messy war. And that's my biggest critique; the backstory, and the setting; because I didn't get a whole lot of logic to what exactly the Hunger Games represented. There seemed to be some kind of starvation component, but it really wasn't made clear in the film, just inferred that food might be in short supply. Yet one was hard pressed to see starving citizens, and with such lush green forests, one wonders why crops aren't planted to feed the people if food is indeed in such short supply. But, that's kind of the premise of the film, so you have to buy into it to really enjoy the film itself. This verse Kirk and the Gorn who were fighting over territory.There's some symbolism going on in here. There's a hearkening back to ancient Greek heroes and gods, as well as an Asmodeus like TV producer calling the shots for the Hunger Games. Woody \"let me tie up traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge some 12 years ago\" Harrelson makes an appearance as an aged vet of the games (as I digress bitterly), who relays what wisdom and beneficence that he can to the selected champions of his district.There's romance, there's intrigue, there's hand to hand combat, there's MTV like shaky-cam cinematography, some girlish moments, and even some pyrotechnics (a rarity for any film). In the original \"Arena\", or rather the Star Trek adaptation of Frederic Brown's short story, Shatner gave another sterling speech at the end to the Metrons who had been pulling his strings the entire time. \"Hunger Games\" does the same thing, only more cinematically, and, unlike my beloved Star Trek, does it with a female bent. Which is better, or which do I prefer? I'm not really sure. Being a starship and phaser kind of guy, you'd think I would lean towards Kirk and crew, but I think I kind of like Katniss's challenge at the end. Kirk uses a Prometheus like solution, where Katniss sticks true to Artemis' ways, even to her ultimate act of defiance to the TV producers and audience. I would ask anybody who reads this to watch Star Trek's \"Arena\", and compare Kirk yelling up at the sky near the end of the episode with Katniss's gesture and solution. Technical notes; the editing is slow (thank goodness), and there're few jump cuts, which makes watching this film easy on the eyes. No digital cinematography here. This is pure film making. The costumes were interesting, and the makeup fell into the same category; trying to look appealing to young audiences while at the same time being edgy and flashy. All in all respectably shot.Not a super sterling film, but, using recycled material from a variety of sci-fi sources, with a gripping narrative, and polishing the package with a pink female bow, makes the film an interesting watch.Check it out.",
    "110": "No, I'm not going to spend this review going on about how THE HUNGER GAMES is a clear rip-off of BATTLE ROYALE (even though it is, the subject's been done to death). Instead, I'm going to talk about the things I disliked, even though I went into this hoping to love it; after all, I invested two-and-a-half-hours of my life in this movie, so of course I was hoping I'd have a good time with it.The first problem is with the pacing. It takes an hour and a half or so for the actual games (in which teenagers fight to the death) to begin. Until that time, there are endless attempts at needless characterisation, some training montages that go nowhere and add nothing to the overall effect, and lots of extraneous supporting characters. Some of these characters, particularly the likes of those played by Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci, complete with stupid hairdos and costumes, look like they belong in a kid's film and the acting is horrendous. I felt embarrassed for them most of the time.When we finally get to the games, they're equally disappointing. It's not just that they're not very violent (although the BBFC's decision to further tone down the violence is frustrating), it's that they're badly directed with stupid shaky-cam work by a director who doesn't understand how to utilise it properly. Jennifer Lawrence gives another bland and unlikeable turn as a stand-offish heroine and I didn't give a fig for any of the characters, good or bad. Instead I was just hoping for it to be over, and quickly, but THE HUNGER GAMES is one of those films that seems to go on forever. By the time some CGI creations are added into the mix (what, did the scriptwriters get bored with the storyline?) I realised that this is awful, awful stuff indeed. And even worse - they're making sequels?!",
    "111": "An adaptation of a book that is popular with teenagers and my daughter pestering me to take her to the cinema to watch the movie. Its Twilight all over again I thought.However The Hunger Games features youngsters in a dystopian future where in the name of peace an annual event is held where selected kids between the ages of 12 to 18 years of age have to fight to the death until the last one standing is declared the victor.Jennifer Lawrence is Katniss who takes the place of her younger sister. Woody Harrelson is the former winner from her sector who teaches her and the male participant from the same sector, Peeta. Harrelson seems not to care and is a drunk but as the film goes on shows perceptive insights as he lobbies on behalf of both the participants as well as training them on how to survive.The film is a mish mash of various themed films such as Battle Royale, Rollerball, The Running Man, Westworld, The Truman Show.Its entertaining but in a daft way. The young actors give it their all, Lawrence shows why she is one of the best young actors out there. However what kind of society which televises this tribute called The Hunger Games thinks its fair that a 12 year old can go up against a 18 year old? Never mind that the viewing public has such a blood lust to watch televised murder on screen when its clear during the selection process that the public are not happy that their children could be selected to participate in the games.The film is also overlong, it is sanitized enough to keep its teen audience happy without the violence being too visceral. Its surprisingly enjoyable but adults are likely to be more discerning than a younger audience.",
    "112": "This is a pretty bad movie, I just don't get the really positive reviews this movie has been getting. So this movie has been getting a lot of hype for a while and thus I was expecting a really immersible and engaging movie, this is just not it at all. I enjoy watch premises like this although it has been done before and in this case it has been done much better than this. The movies that comes to mind is \"Battle Royale\" and \"The Running Man\". \"Battle Royale\" has done a better job with this type of premise and made it engaging although it can be startling at times. And although it had way more students having to play the life or death game, most of them stood out to some degree. And it focused on all the different students while having very few main protagonist the story revolved around and it still worked. This time there is like 24 students playing the game and none of them stands out except maybe 2. The movie focuses on two characters in the game but after a while they just come off bland and boring after a while. I don't get why they would have 24 people playing if hardly any of them stand out at all. There is also obvious plot holes in this movie as well. So in this there is couple of Districts going from rich to poor, while the rich district look futuristic and very retro the poor districts looks like the people are living in the 1930's. With all the hype this has been getting I didn't expect a teenage romance movie but that element is a big part of this movie. I should have caught one when bunch of 12 yr old girls were at the bookstore looking for this book and being really into it. So there is 24 teens fighting for there lives but you don't care about any of them, there is almost no character development so if one dies there is no attachment. Jennifer Lawrence was pretty good as Katniss and Woody Harrelson stood out but that is about it. The theater was packed but a lot of the audiences was yawning and I heard one of them say \"this movie sucks\". The romantic parts are drastic and super corny to the point even the girls were giggling and laughing. And not because the movie was trying to be humorous but the some of the audiences was laughing at how corny the movie is. This movie just lacked excitement. What was really disappointing is the main event where the teens has to fight each other to live. But that was the most boring part of this movie, the beginning when the teens get selected and the training is more entertaining than when the actual game begins. So the build up for the main game is drawn out for a long time but the build up leads to disappointment cause it just isn't that entertaining. The cinematography is choppy just so they can show the violence off screen sometimes since this is a movie for wider audiences. I can sort of see the direction this was wanting to go but it just didn't get there. This might have worked better as a TV show with maybe 6 episodes for better development maybe. I haven't read any of the books in this series and this movie slightly made me want to read it. Since it's been getting a lot of hype and the movie just wasn't that good, thus the book might be better. And this might be a poor transition from book to movie. Elizabeth Banks is also in this and she plays Effie, I don't don't know how that character is in the novel but she was pretty good in this and when I first saw the movie I couldn't recognize her.5/10",
    "113": "The Hunger Games is a movie about the authoritarian rule of a corrupt government that sponsors an annual reality-TV death-match between innocent kids. Sounds horrific right? Repulsive? Inhuman? You'd think so. Yet the only horror here is that the film plays out like a shallow, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster complete with an obligatory love plot and green screens galore. Seriously, talk about wasted potential. The source material is definitely there. The themes take nods from classics like George Orwell's 1984, William Golding's Lord of the Flies, and Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, laying the groundwork for a film that could've been a deep, disturbing philosophical examination of human nature and the dangers of government. I'm honestly upset that I didn't read the novel before seeing the film. In the hands of a capable and talented director, I truly feel that this story could've made for a fantastically effective, provocative film. This is what ultimately makes the end result so frustrating to watch. It's basically like gearing up to lift an 800 lb dumbbell only to have your arms swing effortlessly upward as you realize the weights are made of Styrofoam. What should've been an excruciatingly weighty, stimulating affair ended up being about as heavy as a dollop of whipped cream, and just as sweet. And that is true hypocrisy of the film as well: we're supposed to be condemning of government and the characters that put on the Hunger Games, and yet the film itself falls into the same category of glamorizing and diluting what should be portrayed as an atrocity. The action is stylized, the grit and violence is subdued, the CG-sheen is blinding, and the love plot is ham-fisted. The true meat of this story, the implications of such a horrific form of entertainment and the underlying themes of how it could've come to be, are almost swept completely under the rug.And don't get me wrong here. I'm not just condemning this movie because it wasn't what I thought it should've been. I love stylized action and I there's nothing wrong with an entertaining blockbuster. But the problem is this movie fails on that level as well. The action sequences are uninspired and just plain boring, which is probably a consequence of the fact that the movie never worked to make me emotionally invested. How can I possibly care about these kids fighting for their lives when 90% of them don't have more than four lines in the film and are portrayed as one-dimensional villains? To me, the majority of these characters were as expendable as they were to the citizens of the Capitol. They ended up feeling more like willing, eager participants than desperate, victimized innocents. The bottom line here is a movie that could've been a deep, provocative, disturbing look at human nature ending up being a shallow Hollywood affair that barely scratched the surface of the underlying themes of its source material. The movie simply felt as manufactured as the Hunger Games themselves, directly catering to the audience rather than challenging it. If you like your government-sponsored child death- matches sugarcoated and served with a large bag of buttery popcorn, by all means. If you're looking for a film willing to dig a little deeper, search elsewhere.",
    "114": "Since \"The Hunger Games\" seems to have been pretty well received, I'm going to be going out on a limb here, but I just didn't care for it. I'll confess that I haven't read the book. Apparently some consider it a rip-off of a movie called \"Battle Royale\" - which I haven't seen. So I really didn't have any pre-conceived notions about this going in. I watched it because I had heard a lot of people liked it. So much for popular opinion.I came out of this feeling as if I had just been subjected to almost two and a half hours of \"Survivor: Extreme.\" In this case, it would be extreme because there's really only one survivor. In some future nightmare world, a government uses The Hunger Games as a punishment for a long ago uprising. Every year each of 12 Districts that rebelled has to send two young people (one male and one female) to do battle with one another and form alliances and kill each other off until only one is left. Meanwhile, this has become this society's version of reality TV, as the whole thing is televised, and the \"tributes\" (the young people in the battle) are interviewed. I suppose if you think about it, it's not actually a bad social commentary about our own society which gets so fixated on the drivel of our own reality TV. But I didn't find it entertaining. Somehow, watching a bunch of teenagers trying to kill each other didn't appeal to me all that much. There's also the fact that I really didn't care that much for any of the characters. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is a bit sympathetic, especially as she tends to young Rue (Amandla Stenberg) - and certainly, Katniss and Peeta Josh Hutcherson) are the only two characters (aside from Rue) that you really could root for, but I still didn't feel much for them.I honestly didn't know what to expect coming into this. I had no idea what the movie was about. In the end, I can't say that watching this was a highlight for me. (3/10)",
    "115": "A completely derivative film that is not only bad, it is breathtakingly bad. The first half is so over the top ridiculous looking it is laughable, and not in a good way. It is as if all the worst hair and clothes designers in the world were recruited to attempt a futuristic frolic filled with oh-so-outrageous fashions and it just looks clownish, not creative.It is a mix of a dark concept with a light approach. We have teens killing each other with PG-13 violence. So we have a disturbing concept spun to be appetizing. All of the sociological statements are so muddled and thrown away ending up pointless. There is nothing gripping or anything that for one minute seems frightening or fearsome. It is all handled with such a feathery touch that the deaths come and go without any feeling of loss or lament. Even the lame attempt at a flowery funeral is without much pathos. The Romeo and Juliet affair is also so unbelievable and the rules of the game change so much it has a dizzying rather than a dramatic effect. It is all so detached and diluted, the movie can't decide where it is going or what it wants to be. A complete catastrophe with so many unfulfilled elements that are just confusing and confounding. It remains a half-baked, horrendous mish-mash of a movie that doesn't bother to be anything but dumb-downed dreariness.This is just so bad that it is sobering. A wake-up call for all to take a second look and demand some first-rate entertainment.",
    "116": "I liked this movie. It is well thought out from start to finish. I know this is an adaptation from a novel so the story really isn't relevant. ( It is a relevant story though.) Did i say liked? Loved! Mr. Ross knows how to make a story his. And he does so here with a good deal of skill. It starts with a nightmare, and this movie is about a nightmare. A well directed nightmare. If you do not think this can happen then think of all the many many millions of people who think it already has happened in many ways.This aside from the science fiction aspects.This film hits a nerve in many places! And maybe more than just a nerve! Conversely think of the parents who would love to have there children compete in such games and be very proud of each and every kill.I liked Jennifer Lawrence's performance because she carries a very well acted movie on her shoulders. That and with a character that while charismatic not so as say Dr. Hannibal Lecter (dark) or Father Chuck O'Malley.",
    "117": "Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the evil Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. A twisted punishment for a past uprising and an ongoing government intimidation tactic, The Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which \"Tributes\" must fight with one another until one survivor remains. Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. -- (C) LionsgateAs someone who has read the novel, I must say now that THG is not a perfect adaptation. After all, when do you ever see a novel be perfectly translated to the big screen? Saying that, THG is an incredibly solid and strong effort that should please the fans of the series as well as those who are curious to see what the hype surrounding the film is. If I were to compare this to the Harry Potter and Twilight series, which, of course, is inevitable, you'll be happy when I say that it's a lot closer to the quality of Harry Potter than that of Twilight. I'd also like to end the issue of THG \"ripping off\" Battle Royale. Let's be honest here: Those who say THG is a ripoff of BR either haven't read THG or seen BR. While the two both revolve around the same concept, the executions are vastly different. THG and BR both deal with different issues and themes, and therefore, the comparison ends there. Additionally, there is no reason why you should like one and not the other.Getting all that out of the way, here are some issues I had with the film: Even with a long running time of 142 minutes, THG condenses a lot of events that play out in the novel and glosses over some details that I would have liked for the filmmakers to focus more on. The condensing of the material cuts a bit of characterization and makes emotional scenes feel rushed, and the glossing over of some details may make it difficult for someone who has not read the novel to understand what's going on. Furthermore, some of the CGI were a bit cartoonish, especially with the use of fire. Let's hope that the next film will get a bigger budget to improve on some of these effects.However, there are some great additions that came with the film too. Since the novel is written in Katniss' first-person perspective, we only get to know about what she sees and thinks. The film takes advantage of its format and adds some third-person scenes that ingeniously expand the world already created by author Suzanne Collins. As a result, some secondary characters that didn't have much presence in the novel have a lot more screen time in the film, including President Snow, Seneca Crane, and Haymitch. In particular, we get to see the behind-the-scenes of the Hunger Games in a control room where the tech people literally get to play Mother Nature. There are also some small plot changes that help set up the sequels.Director Gary Ross makes the great decision to downplay many things, with the use of hand-held cameras and the resistance to glorify many cinematic techniques. For example, the score by James Newton Howard is only used when is necessary, and when it is used, it's used effectively. This makes the world of Panem feel real and the issues more pressing. Of course, the shaky cameras also allow a lot of violence to pass with a PG-13 rating, resulting in possibly the most violent PG-13 film I've ever seen in my life so far. I also have to give a shout out to the sound department as well, which is another aspect that is taken advantage of to convey the violence. With the start of the film, we are put into an unusual world that we learn ourselves as the film progresses instead of the characters telling us every important plot point because they naturally know the rules of their world already. On top of that, the bleak and somber tone is done extremely well, with the build up to the game terrifying.Of course, this is Jennifer Lawrence's film, and the camera is mostly with her the entire way through. Accordingly, it's a good thing that Lawrence does a terrific job in her role, playing the strong-willed character with such incredible subtlety that it aches us when she finally does show her emotions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta does a great job as well, successfully giving the character the charismatic quality that was in the novel. Adult stars Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland are just great, doing justice to their roles. Sutherland, in particular, plays a menacing villain without showing much emotion at all, delivering his lines in such a subtle yet fierce manner.If you think about what the filmmakers had to work with, a book told in first-person of a new world, and saw what resulted on screen, the accomplishment is commendable, if not entirely amazing. With the direction of Gary Ross and a powerhouse performance from Jennifer Lawrence, THG is a faithful adaptation of the novel that deserves the success it receives. Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be EVER in the series' favor!",
    "118": "I will start off by saying that I did not read the books. I'm also one of those people that when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was a Battle Royale remake. When I found out it wasn't, I was quite surprised, cause they seemed very similar. You cant always judge a film by it's trailer though. So to be fair, I decided to give this movie a chance, and not go into it comparing the two.The movie has quite a slow start, and even though they take a long time building up; I didn't get the idea that I was getting to know any of the characters. They really didn't do a good job making any of the characters likable, or let them develop in any way. The main character in this film, Katniss, was already portrayed as a tough girl from the very beginning of the film. Nothing in the first part of the movie did anything to either develop this, or add to it.When the games finally start, I was kind of excited, because I was looking forward to some action finally. Unfortunately for me; the action was lacking quite a bit. Shaky camera-work, which I guess is meant to be artistic these days, left a lot of the killing to your imagination. Due to lack of character building in the beginning of the film, I didn't really mind who died, cause I didn't feel any connection with any of the characters. On top of that; many scenes from the actual games seem to be lacking dept, reason or logic. It was as if they went for too many scenes in too little time. This resulted into the whole story of the movie being kind of blur to me, and left me wondering if there was even one there.On a positive note; the acting was quite OK. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed her role quite well, and her acting had nothing to do with me not being able to relate to her character. Elizabeth Banks was splendid, as a character that at first sight seems totally misplaced in this world, but totally works in the way it's portrayed. All in all, I'll have to be fair and say I don't quite get the hype. The movie seemed to be lacking in too many areas, in order for me to stay interested throughout the entire two and a half hours. Not comparing this film to Battle Royale while watching it was made quite easy, simply because this wasn't close to being as good. A missed opportunity for an interesting theme like this!",
    "119": "The Hunger Games is as straightforward as book adaptations get. Nearly every scene is taken word from word for the page, and while some things obviously have to be left out in the interest of time, watching the movie is incredibly close to the experience of reading the novel. And in this case that's a very good thing, because The Hunger Games is a great book and makes for a great movie. The tone is spot-on, be it the frivolous, manic environment of the Capitol (the ruling city of the future post-war remains of America and yearly organizer of the Hunger Games), the unflinching poverty of District 12 (home of our main character and several other people important to the overall story), or the brutality of the games themselves. Nothing featuring children killing each other should be easy to watch, and the PG-13 rating doesn't stop several scenes from being wince inducing. The violence is never really glorified or lingered on, but it's there. I loved Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Any concerns I had about her being a little older than the character or too \"healthy\" looking were quickly forgotten. Katniss is defined by her determination and resourcefulness, and Lawrence nailed that. I also was pleasantly surprised by how well most of rest of the cast embodies their characters, including Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, who actually made me like the character in the movie more than the book. Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Woody Harrleson as Haymitch, and Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane all help bring the world to life by handling their characters so well. Even the actors playing the other contestants in the games managed to be memorable and show the essence of their characters, no matter how brief their scenes are. If you're a fan of the books, put your worries aside. This is The Hunger Games you know and love on the big screen, and it's done well. If you're new to the franchise, just know you're in for a thrilling, often brutal, and occasionally touching story.",
    "120": "Overall it is great to see the novel brought to life on the big-screen. First of all, kudos to the actors - each does a marvelous job with their roles. Harrelson, Lawrence, Hutchinson, Tucci, Banks and the rest of the cast - they all nail their characters and do them honor.The heart of the story is intact, unfortunately there are many significant elements from the novel entirely missing, or changed to the point they lose the depth of meaning they were intended to have. Unlike some of the sub-plot and story elements left out of the Potter and LOTR series, these missing and adulterated items matter greatly, and lessen the quality of the movie. I will give the producers credit for building Seneca Crane's role in an effective way that answers many questions for those that have not read the books.Finally - production values. You will suffer significant eyestrain after 2.5 hours of glaring close-ups. All of the action is shot so close and is so muddled it is almost impossible to determine what is happening. The chariot display is shown either to close or too far away, and in both cases so fast that the impact of the glorious entrance and introduction of the tributes is lost. The CG shots (thankfully there are few of them) look like leftovers from a Syfy channel production. This may be the worst big-budget production to hit the big screen in years. Although Ross worked well with the actors, he did not handle the action epic elements well at all. The cinematography is atrocious and the whole production looks cheap.You will enjoy the movie, but you will also wish for the grand and respectful care-taking that was given the Potter and Lord of the Rings franchises.",
    "121": "How you feel about this movie and rate it, is in my opinion very depended on the fact whether or not you had seen \"Battle Royale\" prior to this movie. If you have seen it, you will see this movie as a bit of a lesser version of basically the same concept but if you haven't, you'll probably be taken by this movie and it's daring and unusual concept.Personally, I had seen \"Battle Royale\" and it's actually one of my favorite movies as well. So no, I'm not overpraising this movie for its originality but I also had some more general problems with it as well, which prevented me from seeing this movie as an absolutely perfect, or a must-see- for everyone.Nothing wrong with its concept or overall story really but the storytelling was still a bit lacking at times. It doesn't always have a right balance of action, social commentary or drama in it, to make an effective enough impact with any of it. The first half of the movie is actually quite slow once you start thinking back about it and it takes a bit too long with its buildup. You could all 'blame' this really on the fact that this movie got based on a popular novel, by Suzanne Collins. Certain storytelling techniques make this apparent and it are little things like this that cause the movie too slow down a bit too much at times.But obviously it didn't bother me all too much, since I still could enjoy the movie. I never really saw this movie as a deep or provoking one but it was one that was very entertaining to watch. It's a real good thing that lots of money get pumped into this movie, since it truly lifts it to greater heights. It uses good looking special effects (it's also a science-fiction movie after all) and some spectacular action.You might be surprised at how violent this movie can be to watch at times. You might not expect this coming from a movie that features a couple of teens, as the movie its leads but that's actually what the whole movie is all about, with some bit more depth behind it but not all too much really. It doesn't ever delves deep enough into things or explains everything properly. You could complain about this, or you could simply take it and sit back and enjoy the ride, just as I did. The movie also does a good job at creating a certain atmosphere. It's set in the future but not a too distant future. So basically that means that this isn't really a too futuristic looking movie and is easy to place yourself into. The look and settings do feel a bit odd at times but never in a too overdone or not realistic enough type of way.It's certainly watchable as entertainment but I wouldn't exactly call it the movie of the year.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",
    "122": "I was sort of obsessed with this movie when it came out. Watching it years later I still love it but can understand that I was a little infatuated. It's a solid flick and I think what makes it work so well is because of the smaller moments. The film is filled with brilliant performances from Woody Harrelson, Jennifer Lawrence, Elizabeth Banks and especially Josh Hutchinson. From the flashbacks to the revelations of his character he really nails. Also good are Wes Bentley with the coolest beard ever, Donald Sutherland and a surprisingly complex Alexander Ludwig. It's easy to write off Kato as one note. A hulking, looming privileged character but those moments he gives him towards the end really make a huge difference. Unfortunately the other love interest of sorts Liam Hemsworth is just eye candy. The movie is disturbing and well made but lacks the punch it really needs to drive the desperation and darkness of the material home. The end result is still an inspired piece of filmmaking that pushes its PG13 rating to the max with an independent, artistic flare. The costumes and set design are award worthy and the impact is still powerful",

The Review Directed by Gary Ross , The Hunger Games was like a thundering clouds which makes lot of noise before raining but actually doesn't rain at all. After watching such an exciting trailer, you will feel a complete let down. Neither it is thrilling nor exciting at all. Loosely based on a novel of same name , the story of a girl struggling to survive do raise few eyebrows but that does not transpire into an must-watch film. Direction is completely immature with movie running sluggishly at a snail pace. There is not even a single moment which is entertaining. Story is good which could have made more sense given in the hands of some other director. Screenplay is haywire. I did not understand if every participant has to kill each other to survive , why everyone was after Kate ? How come little Rue came to find the whereabouts of Kate and how did she protect her continuously for 2 days ? I am still surprised to the 7.5 IMDb rating for this boring flick. The only silver lining is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence. She leaves no stone unturned when it comes to superb acting. Rest of the star cast are average. At Direction and Cinematography is good. Background score is nice. Dialogues are just OK. Overall , a very boring and disheartening film moving at a snail pace. Neither it is entertaining nor it has any good action scenes to keep viewer's interest alive. Disappointing 1.5 /5",
    "124": "Yet another epic set in a very dystopian not too distant future. A bankrupt,hungry, dysfunctional and soulless North American country called Panem stages a fight to the death epic featuring teenagers from ages 12 to 18 from the 12 Districts to compete. They train all their lives-sort of like former East German Olympians -for this event where they have to face explosions, fires, being shot at and attacks from rabid wild dogs among other things all filmed on a jerky nausea inducing hand held camera. A backwoods teen with the unlikely name of Katniss Everdeen replaces her sister who was \"chosen\" to compete, and therefore she must train to prepare for the games. Highly deriverative film \"borrows\" elements from \"The Most Dangerous Game\", \"Lord of the Flies\", \"Rollerball\" \", \"Battle Royal\" and last but not least \"The Runing Man The games themself are a cross between \"Gladiator\" , \"Fear Factor\"and \"Survivor\", and are quite graphc as teen after teen is eliminated while a zombie like population is forced to watch. The set up takes about half the film's lenght to get there, and once the games begin, the violence starts. Film totally misses the mark because it takes itself way, way to seriously. It would have worked a lot better if it was made as a black comedy or a satire on the so called \"reality shows\" the author Suzanne Collins obviously based these books on, but no attempt is made to correlate the two. Jennifer Lawrence and the mostly no name cast is good, but they don't do very much other than act grim and self determined to succeed at their tasks. As I have already said ,what this film desperately needs is a tongue in cheek sense of humor to help the story move and lighten things up a bit, but the fimmakers totally blew it. I'm sure the 'tween age girl target audience this film is aimed at probably doesn't remember \"The Running Man\" with Schwarzenneger where condemned criminals had to compete on a game show to fight for their lives. What made that film work was the dead -on satire , a keen sense of humor, the brilliant and hilarious one liners and the utterly improbable scenario that the audience \"got\" not too long after the film started. This one uses the same premise, but makes very poor use of it. I'm sure it will do good at the box office with all the hype its been getting, but you will definitely leave the multiplex feeling \"hungry\" for something more satisfying Also, don't be too surprised if you soon start hearing names like Katniss and Peta becoming popular after the drones who watch this overrated piece of drek deciede to name their offsprings as such .Another P-U movie review from Lou!",
    "125": "I'd read a couple of professional reviews, thought I knew what to expect. I was wrong. One reviewer thought the motion camera was overdone. In the beginning it did seem as if it might go that way, but quickly it calms down and you forget about it. Another reviewer thought a couple of the characters needed some of their back story told as in the book, but I didn't read the book and didn't miss it at all.What I noticed first was how gripping it all quickly became. I think the director and his screenwriters did a wonderful job. It felt as if the essence of some very compelling book was being conveyed. And that actually was what I thought about second, that I am now extremely curious to know more about the book's author, Suzanne Collins. This film gives no indication it was written by some wishy washy woman without a clue about real combat. There's been some real thought given to what might have happened in real life though her real gift to her readers is her keen understanding of the way leaders manipulate.But the real driving force behind this movie is divided between the writing and the lead, the mega-impressive Jennifer Lawrence. I remember seeing her in 'Winter's Bone' another film set in hill country and thinking I'd like to see more of her. Boy, was I right. Spending the time of this movie with her is a true joy. But her real trick is, I still want more! Something about watching her is very rewarding. I'm at a complete loss as to what exactly except that I kept thinking I know exactly what she's thinking and feeling. That's very rare, especially for such a young actress, I think, to be able to reach an old guy like me so clearly and effortlessly.Of the rest I'd give special attention to Woody Harrelson who is spot on and Donald Sutherland who seems to know about leadership for real. I've no idea where this trilogy is going but I do know I want to see it as it seems millions of others do. I saw this at a matinée in a smallish town and it was packed. I don't doubt this series will be in the Potter range.Finally I'd mention one small quibble I have, but what for? You'll probably notice it yourself and then quickly forgive the director for it. So why mention it at all? Go enjoy!",
    "126": "Tight, well written action sequences was the best part of the book. The character of Katniss was not particularly likable (the author even went to great lengths to have Katniss state that herself a few times). The story line was a bit forced, but that is acceptable in a young adult title. It was a quick read overall, and that made the net gain (in the Hunger Games book) worth the time spent reading. A fast paced action story.The movie decided it would use shaky cameras for dramatization. Not just when it might actually add drama (like when viewing the District 12 area for the first time) but throughout the entire movie. And I think the director might have ordered the cameraman to shake the camera particularly hard during major action sequences.The net effect is, the action sequences are a huge blur, a moment of clarity, a huge blur, action done. Taking the action out of an action story pretty much misses the whole point.If you read the books and enjoyed the well written action, don't bother with the movie.",
    "127": "This must be one of the most hyped films over here in Europe this summer and naturally I took precautions to watch it due the fact that hyped flicks mostly fail for me. The Hunger Games are based on a book and here things already go wrong. It is loosely based on the book. I just will refer to the dogs at the end of this flick, here they are created by the masters of the game. In the book they are the dead that resurrect into dogs. A big difference and also one of the reasons that shows that it was made for the youngsters among us. While the books have a lot of blood and gore the flick doesn't show us anything of that. But is it all that bad, no, there are a few good actions taking place and it never bored me but it failed by choosing for a flick that fits for whole the family. By saying that it brings me back to another trilogy I doesn't like, Twilight. The way the lover birds are talking does take you back to Twilight. I was more into the brutal Immortals (2012) a flick that failed for others but worked out fine for me. If you like The hunger Games but would prefer it a bit rougher then I should recommend Battle Royale (2000) but let's wait for the remake of Battle Royale coming out in 2015 if it will be like the original one.Effects and acting was okay but it's a trilogy I wont follow any more. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",
    "128": "Having a weak spot for Jennifer Lawrence wasn't enough, at least not in my case. OK, this wasn't any of her strongest performances, but that wasn't the problem for me. For some reason, the story and the storytelling just didn't do it for me. Not only was it far from incredible, but most of the time it didn't even feel credible.The Hunger Games depicts a dystopian future by looking back in time, to the gladiator games of Roman times. Some of the scenes with Stanley Tucci, a very accomplished actor that I normally enjoy watching, gave me the feeling that the crew's understanding of Roman times was based entirely on Ridley Scott's Gladiator. Oh, and Mr. Tucci's character is called Caesar, by the way, if all the other references were too subtle. That can hardly be blamed on the film, however, since it was based on a novel by Suzanne Collins.Donald Sutherland was perfectly cast for his role, and he did his job well. Unfortunately, however, we didn't get to see much of him.All in all, the film was OK, but not something I would watch again.",
    "129": "Let's start with a positive: This cast is star-studded. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the stars do a good job, but it's a start-- and luckily for us, they do a tremendous job. Jennifer Lawrence enters the celebrity life coming out of her role as Mystique from X-Men, and perhaps for another time to discuss, I hate that character. With that said, she was also coming from an Oscar nomination for Winter's Bone-- a lifeless film that nobody need bother to see unless you're just compelled enough for the one bright spot of the film which is her performance. And Jenny from the block is handed the role of Katniss Everdeen, a persistent heroine sure to have inspired girls everywhere. Needless to say, she had big shoes to fill, for everybody would be judging whether she fit the mold of the character envisioned from the book. And emphatically I will tell you that she succeeds. You root for the gender role breaking Katniss at every step. Perhaps even more impressive than Lawrence are the people she is surrounded by. The unrestrained costume designs for the Capitol work so well with Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Bank's characters. But easily my favorites are the hilarious Woody Harrelson and Wes Bentley's beard.Undoubtedly, you guys know the basis for The Hunger Games. Even so, it is important to at least talk about the structure. There are two distinct halves in the film: the ceremonies before the Games, and the Games themselves. And in the off chance that you have no idea what The Hunger Games is, I shall briefly clarify. A future dystopia consists of 12 districts. In order to keep the threats of revolt at ease, fear is struck by an event known as the Hunger Games that takes place annually. Everybody ages 12-18 have their names put in to be drawn at random with two tributes from the 12 districts, a male and female. And for those of you counting at home, that's 24 tributes every year.Katniss lives in District 12 with her sister and mother. This district is mineral based, and thus, also hard-working and poor. To the credit of the film, lots of this can be inferred through visual context instead of pointless exposition. The film is 140 minutes, and even though I think that could have been reduced through some cuts, it reminds me of what happened with Jurassic Park. Just like author Suzanne Collins, Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton also had a hand in writing the screenplay for the film adaptation. And he explained what he did by saying that about 10% of the book made it to big screen, and this is simply because that's all that could be fit into it. Similarly, there's details I wished to have seen made it to the movie, but there's only so much that can be done. With all that they had, there's nothing huge that got excluded to cause any outrage.Something becoming familiar ground is a love triangle in these dystopian teenage novels. And there's certainly glimpses of this in this film, but I'm glad we aren't swarmed by it (can't speak for the sequels). One of my negatives follows from this. I have been a fan of Josh Hutcherson, but to be a little hypocritical, he is not what one imagines as Peeta. The best way to describe his performance is just \"good,\" nothing more, and really nothing less. And completing the triangle is Katniss's childhood friend, Gale. And I'm not sure how much there is to think about for Katniss, for when I have the chance to pick either Josh Hutcherson or Liam Hemsworth, you know I'd take Liam any day... What, I'm getting off track? I do apologize.As I said before, there are two halves to this film. And separately, they both work. And they are necessary together, but it is pacing that simply is designed better for a book. The ceremonies are fresh and entertaining, but it's a lot of build up for what will end up turning into another half of the film. And this again plays into my belief that ten minutes or so of run time could have been cut to flow everything better. In regards to the Games themselves, I think what was accomplished is pretty astounding. I was so curious how you transfer weeks of survival in the forest into an hour of action-packed fatal adventure. There's never a dull in the action, yet no scene is forced. And the brilliantly harrowing setup for Collins's plot is transferred to the screen by shaky cams that bring the audience to the arena while giving glimmers of wonderful nature in, ultimately, all that the Capitol and its citizens see, a reality show-like game. Gruesome? Absolutely. Stunning? Well, not on the same level of some beautiful films, but for the sake of compliments, yes, stunning.\nYou can find this review and dozens of others at gillipediamoviereviews.blogspot.com",
    "130": "Addressing the concerns of violence in The Hunger Games movie: The acts of compassion outshine the acts of violence. Also, the message of persevering through something so tragic, and being the spark of hope that eventually surpasses fear, is a great message for kids -- as well as, good verses evil. If you talk to your children about life and how cruel people can be, and to try and be a good role model for compassion, they will understand this movie. As the old cliché goes \"the book is better than the movie.\" -- not so in all cases, but in this, it's true. I have to say, they did a good job with this one -- being that it was written in a first person narration, it was pretty close to the novel, and truly captured the essence of the tragic tale. As usual, with every novel that has been adapted into a screenplay, there will be some changes and some things left out in the making of the film. But, overall I was pleased with this movie. Before anyone critiques it, they should see it, as well as read the books. This movie has been criticized for its violent content -- but, kids today are actually exposed to much worse through TV, movies, video games, music, etc...as well as the DAMAGING doses of sex being slipped into every form of entertainment we're exposed to in our society. We should educate our children with the knowledge of how blessed they are to be living in a free nation such as ours -- instead of places like the Sudan, where people are suppressed, terrorized, starved, and slaughtered, everyday. There is a huge difference in trying to keep your child's innocence intact, compared with keeping them naive to the cruelties of mankind. Also, if you've ever read the famous works of The Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, and other greats, you'll know that many stories written have exposed children to such good and evil of this world...providing many with a moral to the story. Movies such as Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc...have their share of battles that contain a measure of violence as well -- as so with The Hunger Games, they too, were forced to fight what was evil. I believe, if at all possible, in taking the negative and turning into a positive. The heroin in this story, was able to do that -- as she's a much better role model than most kids have on TV. Also, there are those who're comparing The Hunger Games to a 1999 Japanese novel, Battle Royale. Both novels are great reads in their own right -- don't knock either one of them until you read them both. The stories are completely different as with the characters. The only similarity is the tragic tale of kids being forced to fight to the death with only one survivor aloud to live -- all for the totalitarian purpose of terrorizing and suppressing the nation's populous with its life threatening methods of control, fear-mongering, and propaganda. In Battle Royale: The kids are all of the same age (9Th grade), they are gassed on a bus during a school field trip, kidnapped, and then taken to an island \"School\" as part of a military research project called the \"Program\". These students, from a single class, are isolated and are required to fight the other members from their class to the death, allowing only one survivor to live. In The Hunger Games: The Dictator, President Snow, demands a National \"Reaping\" of two kids, one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12 and 18, taken from their home districts to the Capital and calling them \"Tributes\", then forcing them to fight to the death in an unknown arena with only one survivor aloud to live. Two completely different plots, but two very good reads. I could go further into detail about each book, but I'm sure you get the gist of it. I highly recommend that both are read with an open mind, especially for those who are so critical without reading them first.",
    "131": "The book is very detail rich and is not an easy one to adapt (true for any literature featuring dystopian/totalitarian societies), but it is a thrilling, scary and moving one too with fascinating characters and relationships.As an adaptation, the film adaptation of 'The Hunger Games' is pretty poor. The basic details are there as is the basic story and crucial characters, but spirit-wise it feels very watered-down and tame with little of the book's atmosphere and the characters nowhere near as interesting. This said, 'The Hunger Games' also fares problematically on its own terms, a fairer way to judge an adaptation from personal opinion and that's how it will be judged here.It is not all bad. Some of the acting is good, with the standouts being a magnetic Jennifer Lawrence, a deliciously smarmy Stanley Tucci, a splendid Elizabeth Banks and an effective Donald Sutherland. The dystopian setting is eerily evoked in the costumes and settings, and help the film start off well with a genuinely ominous depiction of District 12 which really give off a sense of dread. James Newton Howard's music score is thrilling and emotive.Not all the acting is good however. Most of the cast actually don't really stand out all that much with underwritten characters and lacking dialogue. In the principal cast Josh Hutcheson (blaming the writing here because Hutcheson has shown, like in 'Bridge to Terabithia', that he can be good) gives a lifeless and charisma-free performance. Woody Harrelson is also too anaemic and somewhat annoying as a shady jaded sort of character which undermines any development or direction of the character, he tries to give a coolness but this feels completely wrong for the character.Lack of character development and halfway-decent writing plays a large part here. The characters had a lot of meat to them before but here are pretty bland stereotypes with non-existent development or direction. Didn't find myself caring for the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, mainly because of Peeta being written and played so blandly but also the chemistry didn't seem to be there. The writing does feel under-cooked, with some cringe-worthy moments and lacks edge or any kind of emotion a lot of the time.Was expecting the story to be much more compelling too. The District 12 stuff at the beginning sets a promising tone, but it takes forever to get to when anything properly happens after over an hour of suffering through under-baked, repetitious and sometimes unnecessary exposition that amounts to little. When it does finally get there, the scary intensity is still lacking, as well as any insight on social commentary or satirical edge, everything just feels rather tame and undernourished.The action sequences are rushed through, lack tension and further spoilt by being shot and edited chaotically and incredibly fake looking effects. Visually, only the set design impresses, the rest is too sloppy and frenetic.In summary, has its moments but very much lacking. 4/10 Bethany Cox",
    "132": "The main problem with this movie is that you need to have read the book to be invested in the ludicrous premise and any of the woefully thinly drawn characters in the movie. Without the context of the book the whole premise of the movie is basically a big \"WTF\". A better script/director could have overcome this limitation to an extent - some of the Harry Potters managed to stand up OK as standalone movies (although not many of them to be fair). Of course, the tone of the movie is *deadly* serious telling me that I'm supposed to care about these 'characters' and the ridiculous predicament they find themselves in. Maybe I would if I'd read the book...The ludicrous premise could also have been mitigated by making the attendant violence compelling - after all the premise is that the masses are entertained by the butchery right ? Which leads into the other major problem with the movie. The violence is completely neutered in order to achieve the necessary PG-13 rating to ensure mass consumption and make as much money as possible. As many people have commented, the build up to the titular 'Hunger Games' took a fair while (all without establishing why the Hunger Games made sense at all). Once the games finally arrive I thought 'OK now for at least some good action'. Unfortunately what I got was an incoherent mess full of ridiculously quick cuts so as to avoid seeing any bloodshed at all. Where's the tension and excitement in watching completely incoherent action sequences ? There is none. I guess it must have been exciting in the book...A lesser problem is the special effects (the flames and the CGI dogs in particular) which are very poor and obviously done on the cheap. The girl on fire scene was laughable to me although I got the distinct impression it was supposed to be a big dramatic scene. I'm sure it must have been in the book...",
    "133": "Someone want to explain to me the title of this pitiful snore-fest? ANYONE -- I dare you! Answer one simple question that should be so obvious it's ridiculous: What the hell has HUNGER to do with the PLOT???!!! They're not fighting over food...they're not trying to FIND food... But maybe I'm not supposed to understand. Maybe I'm supposed to read the book to understand. Just like \"Seabiscuit.\"But that's just the tip of the pathetic iceberg. Definitely hard to know where to start the postmortem on this turd...but let's begin with the camera-work.. and I use that term loosely. For years, the Shakicam style -- jerky, hand-held zooms and sudden, erratic pans (not to be confused with good, hand-held documentary work) has gained popularity in both movies and television. It probably started on TV shows such as\"NYPD Blue,\" then later, \"The Office.\" I guess the idea is to simulate documentary filmmaking, or reality filmmaking, or whatever the hell they call it these days. Movies like \"Cloverfield\" and \"Blair Witch Project\" used this style to convince audiences they were watching a home movie. Fine -- they made their point.But somebody want to tell me WHAT THE HELL HAS \"HUNGER GAMES\" GOT TO DO WITH A HOME MOVIE SOMEONE SHOT WITH THEIR CAMCORDER?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!What was Gary Ross trying to prove? It can't have been Tom Stern's fault (Eastwood's current favorite cameraman). He's been shooting extremely steady shots, from tripods, for years. You know, normal scenes you can actually follow that aren't a blurred, frantic jumble of swish pans and out-of-focus abstract images. The only explanation is that Ross, a middle-aged guy with absolutely NO connection to the average teenager or 20-something, must have figured this was the way to play down to the demographic that loved the book. The shaky \"reality\" look is the only way to be \"hip\" -- and show teens this is really their movie, part of their generation, part of their reality-TV/camcorder/mumble-core/Internet upbringing. Right?!?Wrong. What an awful, misguided miscalculation. For this disastrous decision alone, Ross should be banished from the DGA. Strung up and publicly tortured. Maybe required to suffer through his own \"hunger\" game (whatever the hell that means -- I'm still not sure).I won't go into the how stupid and clichéd the script is, how it rips off \"The Running Man\" and \"Westworld\" and \"Rollerball\"... or how the idiotic, contrived \"happy\" ending with Catnip Whatever and her cross-eyed, pseudo boyfriend hammered the final pitiful nail into the coffin of this pitiful attempt at cashing in on a book series by launching a money-making movie \"franchise.\"Let's just say this putrid waste of celluloid is an embarrassment to the world of cinema and a permanent black mark that will never be washed off the once-opulent silver screen.",

They don't even know what 'star crossed' means. How sad, they could have made an interesting film, instead of this tosh. I thought, for a while, that it might be anti-fascism, instead it was a bad modern re-make of 'Triumph of the Will'. Yankland Über alles in der Welt'. Well, I suppose that you have to accept that it reflects the Zeitgeist. I think that Neitzche, if shorn of all his aesthetic sensibilities, might have liked it.What is worst about the whole thing, really, is that such a badly made, fascist film is so popular - if it had just gone straight to DVD, where it belongs, it wouldn't be such a sad indictment on popular taste and popular sentiment (sentimentality, really). I suppose that we have to accept that, like the depression in the 1930s, this depression has, almost inevitably, led to an adoption of fascist mawkishness. Wouldn't it be nice if humanity was capable of something better.",

At least that's what it looks like. It's Awful with a capital \"A\". I continue to be amazed that insipid, sickly-sweet pablum like this continues to be made with any seriousness.The whole thing seems like a joke on it's own audience, a twisted experiment by Hollywood to see how bad they can make movies before the audience simply abandons them. Based on this experiment, it seems they can make them pretty damned bad.Here are some of the plot points in this mess:-- A world starving so badly the answer is to pit children against each other in battles to the death? -- Rich parents train their kids to fight these battles on purpose?

    "136": "I went to see this movie, without high hopes – but interested in what I thought would be a story focusing mostly on a dysfunctional futuristic society, and the reasons why it has turned to this barbaric way of treating different classes of society. However I had a lot of apprehension about it – with the hints of it probably becoming the next 'Twilight.' My conclusion 2 and a half grueling hours later, is that it is a stupid movie, made for a stupid audience. And it is bad cinema. Its target audience is most definitely the twilight fans lost at the end of the saga. Every single moment that might not have been 100% clear to the audience, was spelled out even further by a voice over LITERALLY telling the cinema what was going on. For example 'I wonder if they realise that it's a booby trap,' and then 'It looks like she has worked out how this booby trap works.' The reason that I felt that this story was completely unbelievable, was the explanation of why they have this class system and why they have these 'hunger games.' It was explained that it is a constant reminder of war, and so that there can be a winner that people can support. This is all well and good, if the movie had structured a society around this that worked. Perhaps if they had gone the way of propaganda and brainwashing, pushing the society to see these horrendous games as warnings to the people. This would have fitted in nicely with the media. That the media controls the world and the classes, entertaining the rich by the slow destruction of the poor. I just did not believe that a society that can create trains that travel at the speed of light, and a cream that can cure any cut, that they will treat people so cruelly that they can cheer when children are slaughtered with an axe. The constant use of shaky close ups, gave me a headache as well as confusing the hell out of me. In the two most important fights, the use of constantly jolting close ups left me unaware who was winning or losing, or even what was happening. It also didn't help that in these two fights, the two people fighting look EXACTLY the same. And was it just me, or did anyone find this movie a little racist? The whole notion of there being one sector that was mainly black, with black people representing them in the game. This is the sector that starts the rebellion. Also, I found it insane that one of the African American characters spared the life of Katnis because he had saved the life of another young black girl, we see no connection between them previously, and must assume they are on the same team because they are the same race. Also, another huge racial thing I noticed was that the entire upper class were white, there were no Asian's or African Americans, no one from any other race than Caucasian. And the fact that it is a fashion statement that everyone in the upper class paints their faces white, is just way too KKK for me. Maybe I am reading too far into it, but its something I could not ignore and it really offended me. This movie left me feeling really angry, because I know I cannot just walk away from it and forget about it – there is probably another 5 movies to come – and if the first one is horrible, who knows how truly horrible the others could be.",
    "137": "Mindset before movie: I was on a aeroplane heading back from PV, Mexico. I saw \"Hunger Games\" on the on-flight guide and I figured what have I got to lose? I'm stuck on a plane for the next 5 hours anyway. I never even heard of the books until my other half mentioned she read them, so I had no idea what it was about. All I knew was there was a huge buzz around it and the critics raved and blah, blah, blah... Despite all the hype, expectations were low.Mindset after movie: Wait a minute... I've seen this before, except it was called \"The Running Man\", and instead of Jennifer Lawrence it had Arny. I like \"The Running Man\" more and it too wasn't nearly as good as the book(which was ghost written by Stephen King). In this version of \"The Running Man\" I felt very conflicted; I didn't want to root for the hero, Jennifer Lawrence, because it is what the rich people involved in this production (the kind of people loosely portrayed as the 'bad guys' in this movie) wanted me to do but, I felt I had to root for her because the character is probably gonna start a movement that will help the underdogs of the story take down the cash chuckers, you know what I mean? Beyond that, I see a bright future for Jennifer Lawrence as an actress, I will always love Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson no matter what they do. I honestly think the major killer of this movie was all the hype around it and that nobody seems to remember \"The Running Man\". They should have just remade that instead. With that said I can tell you that anybody who likes this movie is probably still in their teens and are more than likely rolling with the hype or they love the book series so much that it has subconsciously put them in a temporary state of denial.If you're like me, have matured beyond your teenage years and have seen/read \"The Running Man\". This movie will make you angry because they just ripped off \"The Running Man\" while ignoring its existence instead of remaking it. However, if you're a pop-culture sheep who just likes everything that is hyped to death, like \"Twilight\" or Lady Gaga you'll probably like it. Oh ya, my girlfriend read these books and she hated this movie too...she also forgot that \"The Running Man\" existed...WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOCIETY THESE DAYS?",

For an action movie built upon the survival instincts of a young and humble warrior, the majority of the film is spent watching people explain things to the heroine and the audience, almost all of which is totally unnecessary. You don't really need to know about sponsors, apartments, blue hair or the repetitious \"Rules of the Game\" so to speak. It just ends up dragging what is essentially a 80- minute movie nearly an hour longer. Despite all the talk of myth that inspired the original novel, we've seen it all before in what is unambiguously adapted from the Most Dangerous Game. Once you get over the novelty of kids killing kids - which seems to be no novelty at all if you watch the news - there isn't much here to go on.Jennifer Lawrence has an honest face which owns every scene, but unfortunately Gary Ross gets it all wrong. Ross cuts to so many arbitrary setups, he seems lost on how to lens and frame this story and by consequence, who to connect with. You end up not caring who lives or dies in what SHOULD be a story of life and death. On the dramatic side, we spend more time hearing people jabber on about nonsense than see them act upon anything. Characters in The Hunger Games seemingly talk AT Katniss, never TO her and it all funnels into unmemorable noise. The empty dialog is shuttled around by lots of unmotivated shaky cam and quick cutting nonsense that doesn't edit. The movie just doesn't flow well and in the scenes where it finally does - always in action - it is short lived. At the end of every scene, I was awaiting the commercials because it feels like a hastily produced FOX show for Friday night.I really just wanted to see the young and talented Jennifer Lawrence out in the wild tracking down Arnold Schwarzenegger from the Running Man. But instead we are held hostage by Gary Ross's witless direction and a dry talky script. This is a movie with a character but no story, a setup but no payoff. Lots of hunger and very little game.Don't tell me I should read the book, because I'll just tell you to watch a movie like Hanna, instead.",
    "139": "Honestly, they would have done the world a favor by feeding the poor, as opposed to making this movie. Seriously, who allows money to be spent?So much is bad with this movie. It is poor in execution and nearly every other aspect a movie can fail on. The only exception being the idea behind the film, which can always be saved / turned into an amazing movie when there's a good director/writer/screen-adapter.This movie could be 10 minutes long and it would have probably been better that it was, seeing the level of boredom peeks from a 10 to a 3 in 2.0 seconds.I only hope the following movies make this a watch-worth franchise because this movie alone cannot even be used to wipe ass.I'll say one or two good points about the visuals. There is a nice forest and a well designed futuristic city. That's it. And a cute girl. The rest is just awful.",
    "140": "CAPS LOCK FOR ADDED EMPHASIS! THIS IS A TOTAL RIP OFF OF BATTLE ROYALE! And before any of you smart alecks decide to say \"how can it be a rip off when its based off a book\", the answer is simple:Battle Royale came out in 2000, Hunger Games was published in 2008. Not only that, this isn't even a decent rip off. It has a stupid one sided love story and its just generally a kid friendly Disney-esk Hollywood piece of poop. No seriously, if you think this is even remotely good, then just go watch Battle Royale... seriously. Exactly the same plot, with the exception, Battle Royale is bloodier, has a better story and is based in a real world country (japan) rather than some made up magical land of pixies and clothes that catch fire but don't burn people.I've seen both, Battle Royale is epic, this is just lame.",
    "141": "'The Hunger Games' has received a lot of hype lately and it has deserved every bit of it! The story is great, I regret not reading the books before going to see the film because it's such an interesting story. The script is very good, dialogue can be a bit bland at points but it can be excellent in certain scenes. Actors in this film perform really well, there's no weak links aside from a few of the district tributes but they do not get a lot of screen time anyway. Jennifer Lawrence is, of course, amazing. She has shown she is a serious actress and has really out-done herself in this. Josh Hutcherson also performed well along with Liam Hemsworth despite not having a lot of screen time, he still makes an impression. My favourite performance however, was by Stanley Tucci. He was excellent, his role was not the most vital but it did shape a lot of the film's context, with him being the cheesy show host with a big fake smile and catch-phrases. His performance was without a doubt the best in the film. The editing was really well done, it must have been difficult to try and make such a violent plot become child friendly, they've managed to do their best. It cleverly cuts away from violent scenes meaning very little blood is shows so you think you've seen something horrible when you haven't really, it's a good example of how films do not need to be violent to have an impact. However, young children can still be frightened by this because it can be very jumpy, particularly during the climax, and the sound effects could scare easily. The only problem I had with this film was some of the hand-held camera work was just too much, there were points where the camera was jolting so much that you didn't really know what was going on. Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this film to both children and adults however, I do believe only people over 12 should watch this film as it can be quite frightening. This film is a breath of fresh air and shows that a blockbuster can be cinematically great as well as commercially.",
    "142": "This movie was made just to make money. It is based on the first of a series of books no doubt written by a group of people (not just a Suzanne Collins) with the idea simply to cash in on children. It has the perfect recipe, popular actor/actress, watered-down violence and an unoriginal premise. There is nothing in this that hasn't been seen before, think The Running Man (1987) without the fun, or Rollerball (1975) without the originality, or Battle Royale (2000) without any good bits. It's made for 12-year-olds who have never really seen anything else other than maybe a Marvel movie or a Disney cartoon. To the movie, it's long, tedious and filled with unnecessary characters, wooden acting and you feel that's it's just trying to build up to the next one (which I shan't be watching). What's worse though is the fact it's fuelled other awful series such as The Maze Runner and Insurgent.I genuinely went into this thinking that it's the next big action series and that I might like it, but no. I hate this film, I hate what it stands for and 6 months after the last one has been released on DVD and Blu Ray, it'll be forgotten about like Twilight and it's audience would have grown up and started watching \"more grown up\" things.",
    "143": "$155m on the opening weekend, a rating of more than 8 on IMDb and so many positive reviews on RT..I don't know if i am the lone ranger left in the movie watching society or there are some others that echo my opinion. I went to the movie watching the previews excited that the previews created pretty good build up to the real story but sadly for me the whole movie was just the set-up for greater things to come ..which never came. I sat through the whole movie expecting something exciting to start any moment..but that moment never came and i left disappointed in the end. I have never written a review for a movie but this one just stirred me up a little. A movie these days runs on either CGI or an exceptional story or brilliant presentation. I found this one had none...the performances by the actors were not bad..but it was as monotonous as seeing someone running on the treadmill for an hour and a half. The movie promised some stellar action..but it had very run of the mill action sequences. This one reminded me of a movie 'the condemned' probably a little on the similar lines..i didn't like that movie when i saw it a few years ago, but this one makes it look better now...it at least had better action. CGI ..i don;t remember if they had to use any for this movie. Even the fighting was minimal and the action was left to the audience's imagination ( you will find out what i am saying when you watch the movie and IF you watch the movie ) It makes me think how these days we are sold to what we see a hundred times a day and hear a hundred times a day and will find even sh** glamorous if a starlet is using it to brighten up her skin. This movie might not be bad overall , but it betrayed the audience ( at least me ) because it promised me a diamond ring in a shiny package but all i got was a well packaged empty box. And the diamond that i found was probably lying neglected in the dirt in the shape of \"the raid: redemption\".and what money it made ? $ 200,000 ! I am giving it 2 points because i love all the movies and it's more like a ZERO for me.",
    "144": "My daughter read the book and 'made me' see the movie. It wouldn't be something i'd voluntarily chose to see, cause i don't like the 'genre'. I have been wondering for decades now when the moral boundary will be taken and the imaginative praising of violence will become real. Maybe it has already with embedded journalists, appointed victims from the Dark House, (home made) video's with the most gruesome content leaping out of every laptop, etc. I try not to seek this part of civilization, being too aware it's there.The first half our of the movie is bad. There is no character building and i was lost several times, having to ask my daughter what it was about. I guess they expect we all read the book first.After that i sort of understood what was happening and it got predictable (i always amaze my daughter, telling her what comes next). There are some reality flaws in it, the purple fashion thing doesn't work and to be honest, if you make a movie like this, please don't mix in some very predictable romance angle, while you should have emphasized on the lust and decadence of the first district. So, story as it is told, not good. (One can hope the book is better)Acting was OK and i was totally surprised to find Donald Sutherland in it. Dude, really, you couldn't get anything better? Woody Harrelson, nice, but i feel he didn't get enough lines to lift the piece to something good. Maybe a lot was cut out, i don't know, but even he wasn't able to get to build a character.Action scenes and video stunt-work blabla, nothing new or exiting.Futuristic thingies, non existent.I won't be looking at part 2, 3, 4 and whatever else they fantasize after this. You catch my drift, right?",
    "145": "OK, There was a potential 9 out of 10 here, but because I had a déjà vu feeling the entire movie I had to make it a 7. Which is still pretty good. First things first, Hunger games. I haven't read the books and tried to not let myself get \"captured\" by the hype, as it mostly works negatively rather than positively imo. But the basic premise of the story, already dampened my anxiety. Drop people in a cage and the sole survivor wins. Battle royal anyone?? Don't know why no one made this comparison, because it's exactly the same...OK, I'll admit that this movie has more depth... but you can't deny that the killin' in battle was more awesome. Anywho, it's been done before basically. Also, the feeling of oppression, the underdog, the poor ghetto districts vs the rich and famous,... almost everything felt really familiar. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't good either. Another thing was the shaky camera in the beginning...Don't know the meaning of this, because normally you start a scene with a wide shot and then, you do the close-up etc. You don't shake your way through everything, hoping the audience feels like it's 'into' the movie more. The entire beginning up until the reaping was just one long headache to me. What I did like was the heartfelt acting involved. Have to give it up for the casting department here, because (almost) everyone was perfect. My only casting criticism was our president snow or what's he called? Mr. Donald Sutherland. Very fine actor, but what was he doing in here?? Looked like he was about the fall asleep. Which saddens me, because he got a good surrounding cast to work with. Give it up for Jennifer Lawrence who gives the performance of a lifetime. My favorite movie moment was a certain burial scene when the games are well on their way, and afterwards she gives their district's salute to the entire world, and by doing so, give the nudge to her people to fight for their own. Wow, I was just mesmerized by that. OK, the guys involved..Hutchersons, Ludwig and Hemsworth are also very fine actors and hold their own. I was even fine with Woody Harrelson, and that's saying something!!I hope that this movie get's the praise it deserves, as it is soooo much better than a certain other book/movie franchise that's going around, intended for the same age group....Here's hoping for 2 more movies and here's looking at Jennifer Lawrence!Raf",
    "146": "The main reason I'm writing this review is that I'm regular user of IMDb for assessing the quality of a movie before choosing to watch it. At the time of writing this review The Hunger Games had an average score of 7.7 from over 84,000 \"users\". I find this score of 7.7 hard to believe after watching the movie, and especially after reading other written IMDb user reviews which all seem to be negative (so is there a bot at work here or some other manipulation going on?). Generally in the past I've found the IMDb average rating a reliable indicator of the quality of a movie, but that is simply not the case for this movie. I think I being generous in giving this movie a score of 4. This is a long tedious predictable bore of a movie. Sure, I'm 36 years old so perhaps I'm not the target demographic, but I am in no way a movie snob. I enjoy science fiction, but I came out of this movie feeling that this movie was a lost opportunity - it could of been so much better. I've never read the books, but after reading many of the user reviews here I plan to, as it sounds like the books treat this story with a lot more depth. Unfortunately I feel the movie is shallow, superficial and way too predictable.",

    "148": "When the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence was cast in the much coveted role of Katniss Everdeen there was a lot of uproar from devoted fans of the novels on which this film is based, I however think that she is perfectly cast. From the early images which surfaced online all the way to the trailer and the final poster I thought she looked the part, and after seeing the final film it's safe to say she nails every facet of this wonderful character. Miss Lawrence is a supremely talented young actress and it's great to see someone with mega talent being rewarded by getting the big roles. She just absolutely nails it as Katniss, from the emotional side to the violent tough side, she is the character.The movie itself is a fine adaptation, all the best parts of the book are present and accounted for, a few bit and pieces have been omitted but it doesn't affect it majorly, the beginning of the story is set in a barren land known as district 12 and it is presented exactly how I imagined it, this chapter is only slight though which is really the only disappointment, i would have liked to see a bit more of that but oh well, the middle part of the story is hilarious with Stanley Tucci stealing every scene, again the eccentric Capitol is presented in great detail, again exactly the way I had imagined it while reading the books. And finally the third act, the one every has waited for is a truly action packed adventure, it's non stop action and you don't fare tear your eyes away even for a second.The romance element is very very slight and not overdone thankfully, I'm glad they didn't over do that, the rest of the cast are mostly great, Josh Hutcherson is nice to watch and you care about him just as much as you do Katniss, and Elizabeth Banks like Stanley Tucci is a scene stealer and great comic relief.All in all the film is excellent, a great book has been treated with care and it's paid off, fans of the book and just general movie goers will love it. Excellent excellent excellent.",
    "149": "This movie was great. People put five stars for this movie, millions of people decided to read and watch the movie of The Hunger Games, and it was as great as it promised to be. This movie was based on the book by Suzanne Collins. However, this movie didn't completely follow the book. Some parts of the book were either discarded or replaced. Even though the movie did this, it was even better than the book itself. I do however warn all people who go to see this movie. Warning: There are no scary or disturbing images, but there are very scary parts in the movie where a person will die in a very cruel manner. But besides this the movie is awesome, and deserves all the wonderful praise it can get. There was no cussing at all, and there was no use of strong language either. Never underestimate the wonderful things of The Hunger Games. Another warning though, this is not for young children. There are moments of violence, and as I said before, very scary moments. There are also a small handful of sad parts. I prefer this movie for anyone ten years old or higher. Anyway this is a wonderful movie, and I hope that the sequel, Catching Fire, will come out in theaters soon. Can not wait to get on DVD. Happy hunger games!"
