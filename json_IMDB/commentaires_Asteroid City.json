    "0": "This film was a huge let down. It was absolutely boring. Nothing happens in the entire film aside from a UFO/ Alien sighting which was shown in the trailers.This film is categorized as a drama/comedy/ romance and it doesn't succeed in any of them. The drama is so minimal that it's easy to overlook. This film tries to be comedic but it is so dry. I can't recall a single moment where I laughed. The slight romance it has is elementary.This film had no life to it. There wasn't anything in it that made me look forward to the next scene. It tries to be creative with a dual storyline. One storyline is that of a play in which the audience is watching as a film. The other storyline is supposed to be the behind the scenes activities of the actors who are acting in the play. It is a bit confusing at first but more than anything it unnecessarily complicates the story. The continues back and forth between the storylines does not add anything to the film. The way the scenes were split into acts was rather distracting instead of adding to the experience.There are so many well known actors in this film and not one single actor is used in a way that delivers a worthy performance. There were just too many characters for no reason. None of the characters were developed. There were a few lines stating who each character was and only two or three had something minimally happen throughout the film.The Wes Anderson's style was somewhat present but not as much as in his other films. It does have a nice use of colors but even that could not help how much this movie lacked any context.What was the point of this film?",
    "1": "When you talk about big movie stars like Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson or Bryan Cranston... people often say, \"I'll watch them in anything.\" Well, Asteroid City puts that notion to the test.This is a movie that's weird even by Wes Anderson's standards. It actually feels more like a parody of a Wes Anderson movie. And not in a good way.I would describe it like this: It's a movie of a TV broadcast of a play about a play... and what we see is the movie version of the play within the play within the TV show (I think I have all of that right... it's all very confusing). What's missing in all of this is any real plot or characters to care about. It's one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. I like Anderson's films, but I just didn't get this one.",
    "2": "This is by far the worst of his movies. Such an incredible cast and he did nothing with them, the acting is good but the lack of an interesting story is unbelievable. It's a pretty film, yes, but even visually, it's the least interesting from his work. French dispatch was his first strike, Asteroid city is his second, really hope there's not a third. Hope he hires a good writer or writers to help him with his next films. We know he can do art direction, photography, and a few funny bits, but he needs someone to help him with plots. Really, with such an amazing cast, to come up with this, is so so so sad. What a waste. Truly disappointed.",
    "3": "Near enough the definition of style over substance. At times seemed deliberately boring. Too much effort was spent in an attempt to seem clever, and not enough effort spent trying to be enjoyable.Occasional lines were enough to raise a slight chuckle, or an exhale of air, but they are much too few and far between in the vast stretches of emptiness.The impressive cast assembled don't do an awful job with what they've been given, but none of the characters have any depth whatsoever. Even if they were, there are far too many characters to form any kind of cohesion.It's quirky at best and painfully dull.",
    "4": "I think Wes movies are starting to become caricatures of other, better Wes movies. Asteroid City seems like a parody of a Wes movie, a lifeless husk of a movie. As others have noted, it's not the visuals or sound - the movie's presentation is beautiful. The actors are all really good, even the child actors. The production design is impressive. The crew all did their jobs very well. But there just isn't anything to hook the viewer - no storyline of any substance and the way of framing the story itself, while creative, is distractively clunky. It all felt forced and devoid of excitement, even in scenes that SHOULD be exciting. If you enjoy a Wes movie for the production design and cool fonts, by all means, go check it out. But you may well be yearning for the Wes of yesteryear instead...",
    "5": "With Asteroid City, Wes Anderson's obsession with symmetry, balance, and immaculate arrangements may finally have gone to his head; he even puts the horizon smack-dab in the middle of the frame on occasion -- epically defying what John Ford might have once dictated. Pretty based, if you ask me.Jokes and Fabelmans references aside, I can see why this has been dubbed the most \"Wes Anderson\" Wes Anderson film to date. (When idiots on TikTok use AI and/or basic principles of symmetry and color palettes to \"mimic his aesthetic\", this is the film they probably THINK they're creating.) This time, he tells the story (which is a play inside another story) of an Atomic Age desert town -- named Asteroid City, because it's situated near the crater left by a meteorite -- where the looming threat of nuclear war infects all, yet it is a place of nostalgia, escapism, and stargazing wonder. Junior Stargazer contestants annually present inventions and gizmos that seem plucked from the pages of a 1950s sci-fi magazine.Speaking of stars, the film features many. Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Tilda Swinton, Bryan Cranston, Adrien Brody, Edward Norton, Liev Schreiber, Willem Dafoe, Stephen Park, and Jeffrey Wright are of course no strangers to Anderson. New to his postcard multiverse are Tom Hanks, Maya Hawke, Hong Chau, Sophia Lillis, Steve Carell, etc. I've heard strangely mixed things about the cast and the acting here.Some argue that these are some of Anderson's most one-note characters yet (his characters are often derided for being monotonously quirky in ways that make them seem interchangeable, while the ones who denote exceptions to the rule never leave whichever setting they're on). Others opine that these figures have more depth in their eyes than ever; that their \"Andersonisms\" seem like mere masks for deeply human truths.You might say this stark disagreement among viewers is by design. Asteroid City is one of the more willfully vague, interpretable, and I guess \"artsy\" Wes Anderson pictures. Some will see a mess; others will see too much to appreciate in one sitting.To steal a line from @firagawalkwthme: \"Anyone saying they 'know' what Asteroid City is saying is missing the point ... the film is intentionally obtuse and open to multiple interpretations. 'You can't wake up if you go to sleep' is an evocative phrase but not even the actors in the film can agree on what it means\". From the same thread: \"The movie 'feels' like it's about a few different things, yet it's also a refutation of the idea that it's about anything. Schwartzman not knowing why his character does what he does feels like an admission that absolute meaning isn't real -- in movies or life.\" Do they mean Schwartzman IRL or the stage actor that Schwartzman plays in the film's framing story? The answer's probably yes.I assure you, regardless, that these performers are all quite funny and, as overcrowded as the cast may seem, each character leaves a distinct impression. You will care more for some than others, of course, but creating so many memorable figures in a relatively short window of time is no small feat. (A friend jokingly observed that the film features both Margot Robbie and atomic bombs, proving that the Barbie-Oppenheimer hype truly is felt everywhere.)There's charm to the use of practical models, vintage props, and stop-motion as usual. I do understand why it's been dismissed as More of the Same, even though it could also be regarded as a climax; a logical conclusion to a career-long celebration of, among other things, cartoons (the world of the play is one in which Road Runner or Yosemite Sam could pop up at any moment and I wouldn't question it).In any event, I also understand how this one cuts deeper and gets some of you so very nostalgic and misty-eyed. One critic viewed it as a return to the sort of familial themes Anderson explored in his early days in titles like Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums, as opposed to the modern hits he saw as being eccentric for its own sake -- paying homage to, say, New Yorker comics without the resonance that's achieved here (David Ehrlich called The French Dispatch the \"most visually inventive\" but \"least emotionally involving\" of Anderson's films). Again, though: it comes down to what you seek within the pastel Rorschach test.As a quirky comedy, Asteroid City works well. As a dreamlike drama, it works better. Either way, as a piece of craftsmanship, boy is it so very \"Anderson\". I'll have to see it again to decide where it ranks in his library, but I do unquestionably need to see it a second time -- (1) because it invites deeper examination that may lead to even greater admiration, and (2) because I very much want to.",
    "6": "Like an Emperor who's missing all his clothes, this piece of cinema once again goes to expose, what a chore these films can be, recycled themes do not bring glee, you'll be so pleased, when titles roll up to the close. It's just a vehicle for bored actors to make money, but the cash they make is not because they're funny, quite the opposite you'll see, as you just get the urge to flee, thinking once again you feel like quite a dummy. Will you learn your lesson this time and then cull, future urges to go visit this guy's dull, or will reviews entice you back, like piles dangling from a crack, that you can't ignore, with their permanent feedback.",
    "7": "Utterly awful, pretentious and boring tripe. Clearly trying to be arty and quirky but had no substance, and no meaning, and wasn't in the slightest bit clever, but rather ridiculous. Noone in the cinema laughed. The dialogue was nonsensical and went on and on and on and the characters were pointless. Some of the aesthetics were good but not sufficient to save the movie. So many well known actors in the movie, presumably bamboozled by its pretentiousness, as no doubt it will win awards despite it being 'the emperor who is wearing no clothes' in substance. I was so bored that it was a relief when it finally ended.",
    "8": "First and foremost, this movie boasted an exceptional ensemble cast including Bryan Cranston, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, and Willem Dafoe. It felt like a figment of a writer's imagination. However, the constant dialogue among the cast lacked genuine peril or meaningful connections. Consequently, the film dragged, with nonsensical conversations that failed to coalesce into a coherent plot. The supposed humor in the asteroid city fell flat, and nothing truly captivated my attention, except for the moment when the alien absconded with the asteroid right before everyone's eyes. Anticipating the next turn of events became an exercise in futility since nothing substantial actually occurred. It's disheartening to witness such a monumental failure of a movie.",
    "9": "I've never gone into a film before with such low expectations. I had read the poor reviews and was totally dis-swayed, the only reason I did end up actually seeing it was because it was the only film playing in town that I haven't already seen. So I wasn't all that jazzed about seeing it.But... uhhhhhDid I see the same movie as the rest of you?!I have no idea why this film has such horrible reviews?! My friends, it is a Wes Anderson film! What did you expect? This is so very Wes Anderson! It's so utterly quirky and delightful, just like all of his other films! Mind you, it's wildly bizarre, and unlike any other film you'll see in the theater but for heaven sakes it was fun! It's absurdity was laugh out loud funny, like all of Wes' other films! It was an engaging story! Every shot was absolutely beautiful! It was a really pleasant time!Do not write off this movie because of the poor reviews, set your expectations to the \"Wes Anderson\" level and you'll have a really wonderful, bizzare time.",
    "10": "Like all Wes Anderson's movies, it has an eccentric design -- symmetrical, unreal, and cartoony, of course, but also a Fiestaware color pallette to go with its Southwestern location -- and a weirdly composed story. Nominally it's a TV special hosted by Bryan Cranston discussing the last play written by Edward Norton, a story about the goings-on at an almost non-existent American roadside attraction/motel/restaurant/gas station where families gather to attend an annual scholarship event for whatever Brainiac teenager has come up with the best space-related gadget for the US military and some corporate sponsor. The festivities are interrupted in the mid-1950s when aliens land and steal a meteor. An emergency is declared and no one can leave.Some people didn't care for this movie, saying it seemed pointless, and the dialogue awful. As I have argued in my reviews of other Wes Anderson movies, so what? For the first point, and it's a 1950s stage play, so of course the dialogue sounds ridiculous. I'm more concerned with the jokes, the vending machines that make perfect martinis, a meep-meeping puppet roadrunner, and the references to Billy Wilder's ACE IN THE HOLE. Anderson doesn't have to make movies with an Important Message. It's enough that he entertains us for a while, and his large and distinguished cast seem content to show up, perform their roles, and claim they had a good time doing so.I was certainly entertained. However, if you're looking for a Message to this movie, how about this: don't worry about the Answers To Important Questions. Maybe you'll stumble onto them, but probably not. One thing you can be sure of, though, is that even when things don't go to plan, even when they go disastrously, outrageously wrong, life will go on. So be ready for that. Or not. It'll happen anyway.",
    "11": "I went into this not knowing anything apart from the fact that it had a stacked cast and was directed by Wes Anderson. Having watched the film, admittedly half asleep by the time it ended, I can't tell you too much more about the movie. I wanted the film to grip me but unfortunately it was unable do that. I was intrigued at first but as the film went on that intrigue started to fade into frustration.The visuals were stunning and the music was pleasing but apart from that there was nothing else that I enjoyed about the movie. This is one of those marmite films. You'll either love it or hate it.",
    "12": "As much as I love the artistic visuals and whimsical charm of a Wes Anderson film, this one was mildly disappointing. There were long speeches that didn't land with humor, weird pacing issues, and a nested framing device of a TV broadcast, the play, and its real-world creators that didn't do anything for me. Maybe it would take a repeat viewing, because the intention behind this was confusing, and it overshadowed the fine little moments that were scattered throughout the movie. As with The French Dispatch, the cast is jam-packed with stars, but unnecessarily so, as many seemed underused, and it felt like there were too many characters. This one needed simplification, a better story, and more heart.",
    "13": "I think the big joke is on us, that we actually paid money to go see this. Ha ha. THAT's funny, unlike this boring movie with an all-star cast. The actors did a fine job speaking the crappy lines they were given. If you like movies packed with stars and no plot, you'll love this one. All the people who are leaving great reviews must be either paid shills or AI. Otherwise they're people who don't want to admit that the emperor isn't wearing any clothes.About 1/3 of the way through, I thought it might actually develop a plot when a spaceship appeared. Nope. My weird dreams have better plots. Seriously.",
    "14": "I've seen my share of bad plays in my time, and even hits that I just found impossible to get through. When good plays are presented, they can make you think. When an outstanding play is produced correctly, it may make you weep. A bad play will leave the viewer with nothing but anger. All three rules about plays also apply to movies, although it's easier to forget about a bad movie that you saw in streaming or on cable rather than the price you paid for a theater ticket.Whatever this is supposed to be will not appeal to many people because it's pretentious, plotless and pointless, and even with an all star cast, infuriating because their presence means that we're supposed to see quality. All I saw was a haze of nothingness surrounding a bunch of people sitting around talking, and while the conversations are supposed to be stirring, they didn't even have the power to frustrate me or stir me, and the result is either you get it instantly or you don't, and the viewer has the power to pull the plug or suffer or pretend their getting something out of it or dig up themes they see coming from it. I chose to pull the power before it tried to pull the power out of me.",
    "15": "I generally like weird cinema. The cast and interesting visuals drew me in. While pretty to look at, the actors can't do much when they have nothing to work with. This is a film about a play within a play within a tv show. The trailers show nothing of the black and white play portions, and I think there's a reason for that. They make absolutely no sense within the film narrative. Instead of a story about a father coming to terms with the loss of his wife (as the trailer advertises), we actually have a pretentious discussion about how to write and craft a story. Everyone is an actor playing a role within a role, so why do I care about any of them or their supposed struggles? Am I supposed to be invested in the play story or the play within the play that is Asteroid City? It's long, pretentious, self-indulgent style over substance and boring. So I'll end this with a quote. George Sanders in the film All About Eve is a theater critic. He says of one play \"It made the minutes fly by like hours.\" This made seconds fly by like years. Definitely skip, I'm not sure even die hard Wes Anderson fans will like this one.",
    "16": "Are we really that impressed by pastel colours and symmetry that we are pretending that this film is entertaining?What a total and utter letdown. I truly cannot find a redeeming quality in this film. Storyline? Non existent. Performances? Either so brief it would be impossible to review them or so robotic that you wonder whether they were explicitly told to aim for no connection with the audience. I mean really- what was the point of half of the characters being there? I mean that with no disrespect to the actors, they did what they could, but truly, what did any of them add to this film?If you watched this film, could you truly, honestly summarise the storyline? Family goes to town that consists of a motel and observatory. Sees alien. Skip to a week later. Leave town following absolutely no consequence of seeing this alien. Why? Nobody knows! Oh, and there's a black and white segment that we cut to every now and again that ALSO has no storyline! How about we make them all chant something about being asleep and awake? That's artsy!I just left the cinema feeling so disappointed. I honestly can't name another film that I have as explicitly disliked as this one in a long time. And I am usually a Wes Anderson fan! I think a refund should be in order!!",
    "17": "I watch somewhere around 40 movies a year in a theater and probably that many more streaming or back in the day DVD or BRD. I've seen movies that thrill me, teach me, entertain me, waste my time or generally give me something in return for my hard earned $$$ and more importantly give me something for my time.Prior to Asteroid City, I had never seen a movie that was a total waste. Don't get me wrong I've seen plenty of movies that I wouldn't watch again, but very few I wish I'd never seen the first time...until Asteroid City.The previews looked mildly interesting. I should've stopped with the previews. Befuddles me how this movie gets a 7 rating from anone.",
    "18": "The storyline.is all over the map. This is totally nonsensible garbage and a total waste of the actors in it and the audiences time. The only reason i gave this two stars is because of the special effects of the town. I rarely review a movie that i don't like, but this was so disappointing that it was worth a shot. There should not be this 600 word requirement. I feel like kamala doing her word salad speeches. Blah blah blah.I don't understand the ratings and the fawning of the professional reviewers over this movie. People were talking about academy award material, really!! As presdent biden would say. C'mon man.",
    "19": "I fear Wes Anderson's prime is behind him. This was even worse than French Dispatch in my opinion. Asteroid City feels aimless and lacking in any real story. Several plots and relationships are teased on screen as if they could be the focal point, but I assure you none of them are.I understand often a story can have many within itself, but in that case (if it's done well) you are given multiple developed plots. Here we have precisely zero developed plots. You won't know who to care about or why you should.You'll first find yourself investing in the playwright, then your focus will be forced to shift to the father of the four kids and the tension between him and their grandfather. Actually.. it seems you should rather pay attention to how the playwright is in love with his lead actor..no wait.. it's about a love affair involving Scarlett Johansson's character.. wrong again, it seems to be about the brainiac kids. Scratch that, I see now it's about the \"special\" encounter (no spoilers). No? I give up.None of the characters have much depth, either. They're sort of cliche types. Also, why cast Tom Hanks and Steve Carell in such insignificant roles? Feels like a waste of talent to me. I thought in the very least, Carell's character was going to be used to sprinkle humor whenever he had a brief line. Not the case.In the end I see Anderson tried to be clever and meta by having one of the leads express: \"I still don't know what the play is about\", which I assume Wes knows his audience will relate to, but it's not cute to me. It's as though he acknowledges the film has no point, and offers no remedy. Ultimately, he didn't know how to wrap up his own story. So he didn't. He lazily killed off the playwright and sent the rest of his characters home. And if you think I've just spoiled stuff, I really didn't, trust me.The famous scene with the incessant chanting of: \"You can't wake up if you don't fall asleep.\" feels like forced significance, but leaves you with no explanation.All the back and forth between the real world (the cast putting on the play) and the invented world (the play itself) did not make the story more compelling, it only served to distract the plot from getting anywhere.I rated it at least 4 stars because the acting wasn't bad and some moments (mostly involving the three little girls) got a chuckle out of me.",
    "20": "\"Asteroid City\" is an overrated movie by Hollywood darling Wes Anderson. It is hard to believe how actors and actresses participate in this movie and professional critics give the hype to promote this garbage. Consequently, the manipulated mass gives the positive reviews in a movie that means nothing and is senseless and pointless. \"Asteroid City\" is absurd, silly, with good actors and actresses but absolutely awful. It is not possible to write a summary since the film is absolutely illogical. Normal people that do not use drugs are not able to follow the absurd trip of Wes Anderson. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): \"Asteroid City\"",
    "21": "I admit, I am not a huge Anderson fan. I generally like his world building and story telling, but there are very view of this movies I really like and would watch again.This movie is just a jumble of ideas that don't seem to have a point. Ironically, I think that is the point of the movie, that these non sequiturs don't actually make sense. The movie even makes this point when the characters leave the movie and complain complain that doesn't understand the 'play.' In the end, the movie is about grief, and overcoming grief, but there is so much weirdness that Anderson has to resort to having characters literally talk to the camera to explain his own movie.The movie is ultimately too much like an \"arthouse\" theater production to be an entertaining experience.",
    "22": "My first thoughts after finishing this film was why did I not leave after 30 minutes, and how when I'm on my death bed and reflect on my life, I will probably go through a spell of self loathing and hate myself for how poorly I used my time on this earth.This film makes no sense. It builds up as if there's going to be some way that all the bizarre things link together but it never happens. There is a nuclear bomb, there is a car driving by shooting things, there is an alien, there are smart children, there is no will to live.If you have any ounce of self respect and prefer to enjoy life, do not watch this film.",
    "23": "I keep waiting for Wes Anderson to zag instead of zig - no perfect frames or giant casts or dry wit. This is not that. Instead, Anderson leans even harder into his usual schtick. Even more perfect frames. Even more giant cast. Even more dry wit. What's fascinating is he still finds new layers and surprises. The 360 camera angles simultaneously blew my mind and made total sense. The nesting egg structure left my whole fam discussing what the movie was about (which we have never done after seeing his previous works). So it was something familiar, but something new all at once. I think this one is up there with Grand Budapest Hotel and Monrise Kingdom. Anderson set the bar so high with his early works, but I love that he finds ways to surprise me without surprising me at all.",
    "24": "\"Asteroid City\" is a diorama to behold.The story is of a man who recently lost his wife and is raising his 3 daughters when their car breaks down in remote \"Asteroid City\" he has to come to terms with grief.But that isn't the real story. This is a stage play told within the bright eye popping 1950's postcard colors of the time. And the production design is killer! It's Neco wafer in tone. And the movie plays as such. I told a friend Jason Schwartzman is now much older than \"Rushmore\" and moves like an adult now. Which is remarkable considering I kept forgetting he was in this movie.The movie is full of whimsy. Moments between Jason and Scarlett Johansson are ruefully romantic. Yet, nothing will come from it. Two sad people meeting in a place where more things happen than any large city.In this case, they are visited by an alien, which then triggers a response from the government. And so forth (again, story within a story).To be fair, there isn't a story here. Most of it stems from it being a play we ONLY see in backstage ways. It taps into the artifice of storytelling. And how random a man (Ed Norton) who slaps together gibberish can get away with not having a point.Director Wes Anderson loves these diorama sets and he is now an absolute expert when it comes to his guiding his performances. A funnier flick than his past efforts (\"The French Dispatch\").Thoroughly enjoyed living in \"Asteroid City\" for a bit.",
    "25": "As the end-credit song reminds us, \"You can't wake up if you don't fall asleep.\" Wes Anderson's extravagant confection enacts the variety of dream-lives that buffer - yet illuminate - our \"real\" life.The film is a nesting doll of performed fictions. The film we've gone to a theatre to see - so far - opens on a small-screen black and white TV image where the host (Brian Cranston) introduces playwright Conrad Earp (Edward Norton) at work. He appears in a small box far away in the small screen. That's two levels already. His surname evokes yet another, the mythopoeic frontier lawman of the everything's OK corral.A fourth is the stage presentation of that ostensible play, which itself moves from the stage to the backstage, inner-level of presentation. Then the three-act play is itself presented as a reel-life performance in the eponymous small desert town near the atom bomb testing site.On that level, the preternatural bright colours and stylized action add yet another context: the animated cartoon. The \"real\" dramatization is heightened into blatant artifice. As if to confirm this context, an actual roadrunner appears briefly in the action and at length in the foreground of the last shot. The \"meep meep\" is implicit.That layering of dramatic production embodies our dependence upon fantasies to guide us, especially in a world more than ever shadowed by the elaboration of that atomic threat. The periodic boom and mushroom clouds leave the citizens shaken but not stirred. As thematic luck would have it, among the trailers preceding this screening was that of the more historic reminder of the birth of the atomic threat, Oppenheim.Against the cataclysmic paranoia of The Bomb, the film craves community spirit. So Montana defends the alien who briefly reclaims the asteroid that gave the set city its name: \"I reckon that alien didn't mean no harm. No, he ain't American. No, he ain't a creature of God's Earth, but he's a creature of somewhere.\"\nAnd aren't we all? Indeed all the film's characters are creatures of a somewhere not quite real but an entrance towards it. Actress Midge and widower Zack move from separate boxed frames into a passionate refuge from their respective tragedies. Zack's antagonistic father-in-law learns a lesson in humanity and respect from Zack's young triplet daughters, their mom transported in Tupperware.With all this fictional layering we often miss the identities in the most star-studded cast since Altman's The Player. The likes of Cranston and Norton, Scarlet Johansen, Liev Schreiber, Tom Hanks, slip by virtually unrecognizable. Conversely, Jason Schwartzman appears usually in his bearded role as recently widowed father, then as the clean-chinned actor. This becomes another kind of layering, of the stretch between the real and the fantasy.All these layers of performance draw us through the director's fantasy to remind us of the debt we, the debt that our science, the debt that our governments, owe - to humanity, not to their own advantage. A timely and tragic reminder, that really should wake us up but....",
    "26": "If you carry out an experiment, you may fail. Asteroid City did not work out for me too well. Yes, the looks are first very interesting and captivating but after some time the impact of the visuals wears off and after that the story itself (and the characters) did not interest me very much. I dare to say that Asteroid City may work for some other viewers better, so this one got the possibility to be a hit or a miss to you. Do I recommend watching this one? No. Do I advise to skip this one? No, once again. I guess, if you are interested in the works of Wes Anderson and you like some of the actors and you like weird stuff you may give this one a try. Maybe you will get some masterpiece, maybe not. I do like some of the actors and I do like my stuff weird but still, like I said, Asteroid City did not catch me, but maybe some day I'm ready for this one...",
    "27": "After the bloated French Dispatch, Asteroid City feels like a bright and breezy return to form for Anderson and has a pleasing drollness about it. If you're not a fan of his affectations then there's nothing for you here as he's rigorously doubled down on the artifice and confection so far it genuinely feels closer to Fantastic Mr Fox than anything live action. There's definitely a smattering of extraneous character work here but I found myself glad of a clear central theme which the previous film lacked. For those who can stomach it, it's genuinely one of his most digestible films in quite a while.",
    "28": "Not since \"Movie 43\" has so many top stars made a film they want to quickly forget. This is a film about a play within a play. We get to see the actors off set discussing a lot of nothing. The setting is a place called Asteroid City which is near a crater that has an asteroid in it. They can see frequent nuclear tests in the background, but the shy remains blue and never any fall out. This is a desert town. There is a running skit of a cops and robbers chase scene with gun fire as they go off into the desert. The town is the home of an awards ceremony for innovative children. An alien comes down and takes the asteroid causing a town quarantine.The acting in the play was extremely stiff by design. The characters are cardboard and the sets are colorful. I would imagine the meaning behind the film is to demonstrate that life has no meaning as the lead character (Jason Schwartzman) is an atheist and on occasion politely makes a comment. The production is quirky. It has witty lines. It has good scenes. It just was not entertaining without a clear metaphor.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",
    "29": "Having watched so many movies in recent years that are utterly predicable formulas it was refreshing to see a film that did not follow that cliché form. To quote the line from Bill Murray near the end of Groundhog Day, \"Anything different is good!\"The casting of the movie is absolutely stellar! Apart from the names at the top of the marquee, it was a tremendous treat to see such familiar favorites such as Steve Carell, William DeFoe, Adrian Brody, Jeff Goldblum, Tilda Swinton, Matt Dillon and many more make appearances. The ensemble greatly added to the experience.I highly recommend the film. If you are a fan of ensemble movies you will really like this, keep a scorecard hand for all of the stars you notice. I'm absolutely looking forward to watching this again!",
    "30": "I saw the trailer for the latest film from director Wes Anderson (The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Isle of Dogs), I was always going to see it, despite some mixed reviews I'd heard about it. Basically, set in the 1950s, (in black-and-white) a TV host (Bryan Cranston) introduces a televised production of Asteroid City, a play by legendary playwright Conrad Earp (Edward Norton). In the play, (in colour) in the fictional desert town of Asteroid City, a youth astronomy convention is being held. War photojournalist Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman) arrives early to the Junior Stargazer convention with his intellectual teenage son Woodrow (Jake Ryan), who is to be honoured at the convention, along with Augie's three younger triplet daughters, Andromeda (Ella Faris), Pandora (Gracie Faris) and Cassiopeia (Willan Faris). When Augie's car breaks down, he calls and asks for help from his father-in-law, Stanley (Tom Hanks). Stanley, who dislikes his son-in-law, persuades him to tell his children about the recent death of their mother, which Augie has hidden from them. Augie and Woodrow meet famous but world-weary actress Midge Campbell (Scarlett Johansson), with her daughter Dinah (Grace Edwards) who will also be honoured. Augie and Midge, and Woodrow and Dinah, gradually fall in love with each other. Other participants of the convention arrive, including three other teenaged honourees: Ricky Cho (Ethan Josh Lee) with his father Roger (Stephen Park), Clifford Kellogg (Aristou Meehan) with his father J. J. (Live Schreiber), and Shelly (Sophia Lillis) with her mother Sandy (Hope Davis). Other attendees include five-star General Grif Gibson (Jeffrey Wright), astronomer Dr. Hickenlooper (Tilda Swinton), young teacher June Douglas (Maya Hawke) who is chaperoning a busload of elementary school children, and singer Montana (Rupert Friend) with his cowboy band. Everyone is provided accommodation at the motel run by its manager (Steve Carell). Gibson welcomes everyone at the Asteroid City crater where the teenagers will receive awards for various inventions. The event is interrupted by sudden appearance of a UFO above the crater. An alien emerges from the spaceship above and steals a fragment of the meteorite that created the crater. Augie photographs the alien. The President and General Gibson order the town placed under military quarantine, with everyone subjected to medical and psychiatric examinations. Meanwhile, Montana and June begin a romance and assure the students that the alien is likely peaceful. Meanwhile, the Stargazer honourees use Dr. Hickenlooper's equipment to try and make contact with the alien. Using a reconnected pay phone, Ricky calls his school newspaper to relay details of the quarantine and cover-up to the outside world. The events at Asteroid City become national news. An angry General Gibson intends to end the quarantine when the UFO reappears, and the alien returns the meteorite fragment. When Gibson reinstates the quarantine, the children, scientists, and parents revolt, overpowering the military using the inventions of the honourees. The story of the play is interspersed with behind the scenes of its creation. Actor Jones Hall (Schwartzman), playing Augie, meets with Conrad to talk about his character. Earp writes the play with help from a local acting school and recruits most cast members from it, including temperamental yet talented actress Mercedes Ford (Johansson) to play Midge. On the opening night of the play, Jones confronts director Schubert Green (Adrien Brody) saying he does not understand the motivations for his character. Schubert tells Jones to just continue playing Augie as he has so far, leaving Jones aggravated. Jones encounters the actress (Margot Robbie) who was originally cast to play Augie's wife before her only scene was cut. She recites the deleted scene's text to him. Towards the end of the show, the cast is saddened to learn that Conrad Earp has died in a car accident. In the play's epilogue, General Gibson lifts the quarantine; Augie and his family are the last to leave Asteroid City. Woodrow is awarded the fellowship funding, and Midge gives Augie her address. Augie and his family quietly drive away. Also starring Matt Dillon as Hank, Hong Chau as Polly Green, Willem Dafoe as Saltzburg Keitel, Fisher Stevens as Detective, Rita Wilson as Mrs. Weatherford, Jarvis Cocker as a cowboy, Bob Balaban as Larkings Executive, and Jeff Goldblum as The Alien. Mark Kermode described this as \"the most Wes Anderson movie Wes Anderson has ever made\", and I completely agree with that. It has an impressive all-star cast, it has Anderson's recognisable style of perfectly symmetrical and vibrant colourful imagery, aside the black-and-white scenes of course, and the song \"Indian Love Call\" by Slim Whitman (which I recognised for killing the aliens from Mars Attacks!) is heard in the background of a scene, these are the positives. The problem is that the plot going in and out of a stage play, with actors playing actors playing actors doesn't fully work, even with colour transitions to help you know where you are, I didn't find it funny, the script could have been much wittier, and I found it too full of itself, it is much too kooky and quirky for my liking, a boring and annoying but not completely awful comedy-drama. Adequate, in my opinion!",
    "31": "Astroid city is not your typical film. It's about a widowed man with 4 children; 3 young daughters (all under age 8) and a gifted teenage son. They travel to Astroid City because the son is going to receive an award for his science project.It takes a special person to appreciate the films writing and design. There isn't twists and turns, only a few bends. It is reminiscence of a film from the 80s. We were fortunate to have someone in the theater laughing out loud. Without that person we would have fallen asleep or left. It's irrelevant that it had an amazing cast. Unfortunately, the story was not so amazing. Regrets,",
    "32": "Big thumbs down for the story and narrative. Thumbs up for the visual style, but even it becomes boring when there's practically zero story to prop it up.I have to agree that this movie, despite its visual style and hype, is nearly a complete waste of one's time.My suspicion is that all of the somewhat positive reviews it is getting is because some of those reviewers want to believe that they have art cinema tastes. What a delusion with Asteroid City. Artsy, yes, quite so. An entertaining and interesting film, not even close.Why are all these great actors stone faced and uninteresting?For me this film landed with a thud.",
    "33": "What a terrible, boring and pointless film!! I fell asleep in the theatre. It's confusing melange and miasma of spectacle. What a waste of a distinguished, sterling and all-star cast! To be sure, there is some exceptional photography. And some witty and great jokes. Alas, for the promise of it all! The five stars I am coughing up for this review are for the great actors, photography and jokes. Otherwise this film would rate a big, juicy goose egg. Wes, next time please do your homework and bring a plot to the party! Leaving the theatre with with that big, sinking, empty pit in my stomach wasn't fun.",
    "34": "Left half way through, along with many others in the cinema. Tries so hard to be different that it makes no sense at all to the viewer. Terribly disjointed and not sure why it's called a comedy. At first I thought it was just me, but after the three others I was with all started to look at each other with raised eyebrows, we soon all realized that none of us were either understanding it or enjoying it. It tries to carry itself through by having lots of well known names in the cast, but not even this is enough to make it a film worthy of watching. We were all looking forward to this movie and wanted to enjoy it. Very disappointing.",
    "35": "One of the best Wes Anderson films that might be misunderstood and appreciated by others maybe even misunderstood whilst being loved! So many color palettes, charm, complex well written dialogue often or simple dialogue, loads of comedy more than other Wes gems, and pure fun entertainment for any age. This movie hit the spot no matter what and so did my mom whom has been loves Wes Anderson films although she's not a huge buff like me that craves cinema I think it's pretty reasonable that she says he's her favorite director of all time.I love how it's about aliens, bonding and Bryan Cranston hosting everything like it's The Truman Show without being a metaphor where as in Astroid City it's more comedic and you know there's a show from the get-go. Hope others appreciate this wonderful gem!",
    "36": "It's a typical quirk fest of a Wes Anderson movie that's in search of a plot (spoiler - it didn't find one) the cast deserved a better script and the set constructors, lighting, makeup artist.... in fact everyone that put their talents toward the making of this movie, were similarly short-changed. Overall, I was left with a number of questions about the purpose and meaning of some of the \"plot\" side roads and diversions. However, taking the whole thing into consideration, I came to the conclusion that I probably didn't need to know the answers and there probably were no answers. It's a meaningless string of live theatre-like scenes combined into pointless movie.",
    "37": "I am big fan of Wes Anderson's films, but he can't expect that quirky cinematography and Hollywood A-list celebrities alone will make a great film. There has to be an actual story worth telling, not something which can be written on the back of a cigarette box. \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" had everything i.e. Interesting characters, wonderful dialogue and an attention -grabbing story which engaged its audience from start to finish. Asteroid City has none of this. All the characters are bland, one dimensional and without emotion- they don't get angry or happy or sad (despite a recent death in the family). They just talk like Joe Biden reading from the teleprompter and the whole thing with the alien is just plain silly. The sub-story in black and white (the Edward Norton thing in the background) is just annoying and doesn't seem to serve any real purpose. The \"French Dispatch\" wasn't nearly as good as \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" but it was still better than \"Asteroid City\". Wes Anderson should stop taking his fans for granted and make a good film again.",
    "38": "Smug writer / director Wes Anderson favours stylization over coherent content, and with \"Asteroid City\" he does so to the max, soaking his meaninglessness in heavy-handed pastel colour, to waste an INSANELY fine cast (inc Tom Hanks, Edward Norton, Margot Robbie, Steve Carell, Jeff Goldblum, Adrien Brody, Liev Schreiber, Willem Defoe, Matt Dillon, Bryan Cranston, Jeffrey Wright, Hong Chau, Tilda Swinton, Rupert Friend & Jarvis Cocker (some only in cameo)). The '50s based 'plot' (so called) has Jason Schwartzman stuck in an Arizona desert town with Scarlett Johansson and their respective genius kids - but what it's REALLY about is Wes Anderson's bloated ego.",
    "39": ". . . as someone who's occasionally suffered from The Heartbreak of Hemorrhoids. Perhaps because of some Post Traumatic Stress and general squeamishness, I found the story of Hemorrhoid City somewhat hard to follow. However, I recall that there were many, many acts to this story, which concurs with Reality, as once you have one incident with Big H, such unpleasantness tends to recur again and again. At any rate, it seems that the Black Widow had a window six inches from that of a vacationing proctor doctor, played by Ash Fox. One afternoon Widow explains her predicament to Ash, who says he'll examine her chassis at no charge. So she steps out of her salt bath in her nativity suit, and Ash lances her obstructed veins through their breezeway. Then everyone lives hopefully ever after.",
    "40": "I love me a good Wes Anderson jaunt from Darjeeling to Budapest with everything in between, I even liked The French Dispatch but this movie is just a slog. From the play within a movie to the odd choice of actors (Scarjo does nothing interesting here and Tom Hanks feels very out of place, almost like he can't just have fun with it) to the lack of just fun. The colour palette is stunning, the sets are phenomenal, the music is on point and the running gags are lovely. This movie does nothing though and I have no idea what it was trying to convey or what the takeaway is. I'm either too dumb to get it or it's too pretentious and heady, watch and make your own decision.",
    "41": "Load the screen with pastels, A. I. generated over stylised close ups and then tell all the actors to dead pan all their lines in monotone non expression. Welcome to Asteroid City.If, after 10 minutes of watching, you get the sneaking suspicion that this movie is 100% style and 0% substance; you'd be wise to turn it off and work on reducing that anger welling inside you at having been robbed of great acting potential. Wes Anderson follows Quentin Tarantino and a long list of film makers in jumping the shark when given too much artistic freedom. During edits it must have been apparent the emperor had no clothes. How this movie became released 'as is' is a testament to the self obsessed hubris of Hollywood.This film's greatest legacy is its pinnacle status as a monumental waste of completely unrealised actor talent.",
    "42": "No offense to anyone who likes Asteroid City, but I can't for the life of me imagine how anyone can get even an ounce of entertainment from it. It is the definition of pretentious and one of the best examples of style over substance I have ever seen.I quit after 38 minutes. I almost never stop a movie, even terrible ones that I rate one star. But I determined that there was a 0% chance of gaining any enjoyment from watching the rest. I'm so relieved I didn't see this at the theater.I've watched thousands of movies of all types. My range of taste is vast. I love sci-fi, horror, drama, action, comedy, mystery, thriller, etc. I can enjoy a mindless blockbuster but my favorites are usually really smart movies that make me think (like most Christopher Nolan movies). But I'll never understand the appeal of this type of \"artistic\" nonsense. (1 viewing, 7/12/2023)",
    "43": "Theatre of the Absurd - in my opinion - is the most intellectually stimulating genre of theatre - later movie - that is greatly misunderstood and underrated in our contemporary times because of modern audiences' need for meaning and clarity behind each and every aspect of the visual medium. There are very few examples throughout the history of the genre in terms of theatre of film, and this - I dare say - is a modern masterpiece in its respective field in that respect.Seek no objective meaning, no context, no concrete structure other than the ones that will naturally come to be in your mind as you watch this movie. It is as life itself as much as life can be as life itself.",
    "44": "ASTEROID CITY is a play about a fake news project. At the start of the movie, we are introduced to the actors and their roles. \"The character of Augie Steenbeck in the imaginary tale of our production was to become famously and indelibly connected to the actor who created the role, a former carpenter discovered in a bit part by the play's director, Schubert Green (born Shylock Grzworvszowski).\" The crisis of the play pivots on an alien visitation. The military attempts a lockdown, which is soon circumvented by the kids, who whistle-blow and attract a media circus. Thus we have all the essential roles of fake news: hired actors, the military, and the fake news event. Sometimes it's a pandemic, sometimes it's a riot, sometimes it's an alien, sometimes it's Guadalcanal.All the characters (Augie, Midge, Grandfather, Parents and Stargazers) are professional actors who have actual lives outside the play. Some are bused in for the fake news event, some are pre-placed, like the Mechanic. Twins and triplets are often used in celebrity roles because they can be in more than one place at a time. Hickenlooper represents Consensus Science (\"the math doesn't work\") and the General represents the military (giving out awards and seizing inventions, including a DEW). The Playwright, Director and Acting Teacher never enter the play itself. The Host plays the talking head role, not in the play but pushing the narrative. The only people not working for the production are the ordinary folks who are alerted by the media (\"everything's already in the newspapers\").Fake news events are scripted and directed by people behind the scenes, like the Playwright, Director and Acting Teacher. Fake news events are role-played by professional actors like Augie and Midge. Fake news events are always guided by media personalities like the Host, who provides us with the information we need to make sense of the staged drama (and utterly failing). With all this professional Crisis Acting, the fake news event itself hardly matters. In the background are the usual fake news events run by the locals (represented by the car chases) and the military-industrial complex (represented by the nukes). The targets of the fake news are the ordinary people who show up for the media circus.While modeling the essential elements of a fake news project for us, the play also takes the opportunity to role-play a sample alien encounter (depicted as partly CGI, partly Jeff Goldblum). The military is on hand, of course, on one pretext or another, and so are the actors. The alien arrives, a professional photographer snaps an iconic photo and then it leaves without a trace. Whistleblowers manage to ignite a media circus in spite of a total military lockdown, and--at the peak of the public furor--the alien mysteriously returns the asteroid, indelibly stamped with alien writing. We have all the elements of a psyop: the ordinary folks, the cover-up, the whistleblower and the undeniable proof.On a metaphorical level, the asteroid represents the moon, specifically the moon landing grift, which has gone so stale that even India is faking it. The asteroid is stored in a little jail cell, which represents the sixty years of transparent fakery that is strangling NASA and all the other space agencies. The alien frees the asteroid, and then returns it, forever stamped it with proof of alien life. A riot is staged by the actors, the lockdown is released, the media circus evaporates, the playwright fakes his death (\"Death of a Narcissist\") and the actors bow out. This is how history is made. The final result is a re-characterization of the moon landing and a general loss of faith in God (\"I hope you're still Episcopalian\").Why does Augie burn his hand? He doesn't. It was the old \"hot burner\" trick. Midge had a different script than Augie, so she didn't see it coming. Augie and his family, arriving on the scene earlier than the other actors, had their own script they were following. Augie's Crisis Actor family was artificially created with child actors. The mother's role was cut, which naturally confuses the children who are too young to understand, but no one else actually grieves. As photographer, he has special access to Midge, the Playwright and the Director. When Crisis Actors have different scripts, even the actors can get freaked out and provide an authentic performance. Note that his hand being bandaged was part of the script (\"They're bandaging the understudy's hand right now.\")\"You can't wake up if you don't fall asleep\" is a catch-phrase, meant to catch you. It's meaningless until someone invests it with meaning. It starts off controversial (\"What?\" \"That's not true.\" \"Who cares?\" \"Why should you?\" \"Maybe not.\") but with repetition everyone begins to parrot the phrase. Meanwhile the catch-phrase is accompanied by traumatic images which work upon our collective unconscious. The zombies yelling and staggering around mindlessly. The alien carrying the moon towards us. This scene models an MK-Ultra class (\"shared experience of a bewildering and bedazzling celestial mystery\") that imparts a narrative through repetition and trauma. In this case, the moon landing spell is being replaced by the alien asteroid spell.",
    "45": "I realized a day after watching what this movie could be about. It's about human life. And no one knows the answer to the questions we constantly have about it. And that's okay. You just go along with the ride. You keep performing even though there may be no real meaning or outcome to the events that transpired. There could be a deeper meaning behind it but there also may not be. It's all about your own interpretation about what happens. I enjoyed this movie in its ability to confuse me, question it, and keep me guessing about what was really going on. This may be Wes Anderson's best work to date and I hope it wins best original screenplay.",

Foolishly I fought with the the in-flight entertainment system to get back to roughly where I was.In my childhood Mum & Dad would drive Route66 to/from Texas to California and the desperation one suffers is rather equal to the desperation looking for any semblance to a plot in this movie. While Wes Anderson has done some quirky movies, even Scarlett Johansen couldn't make this watchable. It was like a very bad LSD trip that just never ended.",
    "47": "The worst movie I have ever seen in the entire century and in my life. It was so boring it felt like staring at a black screen for 10 hours.

It was not funny at all and the characters were such boring people the only person that was cool was the motel manager. It was a complete waste of time. Don't watch unless you want to get most board you will ever be. It you do not end up seeing this you are so lucky. I wish I could erase this from my brain. Before this movie comes out tomorrow (since I saw the pre showing) don't watch it whatever you do.",

I thought maybe it would be campy like \"Mars Attacks!\" but it was not funny, it was not dramatic, there was no suspense - a complete dial-tone of a film.I have no idea who Wes Anderson is, but I think he should be liable, legally, for assaulting the conscience of those unfortunate enough to view this nonsense and inflicting such pain and discomfort in the process.",
    "49": "A story featuring writers is always welcome. And with Wes Anderson in the director's seat, that prospect promised something better.In \"Asteroid City\" (named after a fictional town in the movie), a famous writer - Conrad Earp (played superbly by Edward Norton) - with a hit play to his name takes us into his script. Sounds simple at first, but the movie took a quick and curious turn.The whole of \"Asteroid City\" was essentially Conrad's fictional stage-play (set in the 1950s) showcased in movie form and given a classic Wes Anderson flourish.At the heart of the plot were diverse characters who found themselves being quarantined for a while in the titular city after they arrived there for a junior stargazing event.Black-n-white sequences (the 'real' stage-play world) flowed elegantly with colorized frames (the 'fictional' world) to tell a deeply human story rife with secrets and subtexts.An outstanding cast of artists breathed life into their respective characters. Altogether, they helped weave yet another Wes Anderson masterpiece. The movie contained hidden meanings, much like a painting or portrait.It also boasted some intriguingly subversive elements - A Native-American G. I., other Native-American references but Westernized, and kids finding themselves in inappropriate places, nuanced 'hidden' references to ADHD and AI, and more besides.I think Wes is probably one of the few directors out there who can break the 'fourth wall' yet engage viewers and drag them interrupted into his movie.A dash of sit-com style pacing and a dollop of witty storytelling made \"Asteroid City\" a highly engaging movie that will keep most people - and all Wes Anderson fans - glued to their screen.The finale chant \"You can't wake up if you don't fall asleep\" defined the soul of this script in more ways than one.",

I felt Wes Anderson's was having a laugh at the expense of the audience. The last film I will ever watch of his.If I could have given it zero stars I would have and that would have been too many.",

Despite a plethora of fine actors, I found most of the acting so stilted as to be silly...deliberately silly, again to make some kind of \"deeper\" point so that pseudointellectuals could extoll the virtues of point and counterpoint in an artifical, stilted, cutsey-futuristic environment.",
    "52": "This film had me interested from the beginning. Straight from the start I felt the Wes Anderson signature vibe. The film is what you would expect from this director. Full of suprises and the unexpected. Something else I loved was the similarity between one of the side stories and Moonrise Kingdom. However the epilogue pulled me right out. Suddenly I wasn't feeling it anymore and, even though it fit the story, I felt betrayed. This is all relative ofcourse. The film was a masterpiece. The ending was just a little less. This film had me constantly wishing I could just consume it in one go instead of having to wait for the story to play out(in a good way).",

I was hyped by the initial trailer with the incredible cast of actors and the ambiguous plot or lack thereof. Only to find out the trailer I saw wasn't trying to hide the plot, it showed it all. Meaning, the plot was less than thin (emaciated).I only remember 30 seconds of this film. It was such an overly-saturated pastel puddle of play-write pretence with no substance and it leaves you with nothing, no feeling. Did this really get an 8 minute standing ovation at Cannes?Experiencing this film was like edging, but for your emotions. Nothing happens in the middle of nowhere. That's it. Also, everyone's lips looked like they ate ghost pepper ice cream.",

I actually fell asleep trying to watch it, and had to wind it back and continue. I shouldn't have bothered. I am also confounded as to the cast taking on this project. It was the cast that attracted me to this film, but I am shocked they signed on for such a piece of boring garbage. I am sure there are those that will like this movie simply because they somehow see it as artsy fartsy. But I want good story telling and goo dialogue. This movie has neither. What a shame.",

Wes has his actors engage in WAY too much dialogue and excruciating exposition with little to no action or intrigue. He directs his actors to speak in monotone with little to no facial expressions - this guy is deliberately making a boring film! Many, many reviewers give Wes a pass but why?! If a film school student made this, they'd be told to seek another career because they just don't get the FUNDAMENTALS of film making! The story, the plot, the performances are all just white rice bland, there's absolutely no entertainment value in this except for its color scheme. 3 stars only for the art/set/visual contributors.",
    "57": "Wes Anderson has a distinct style. If you are unfamiliar with his style, you can still feel a different energy from his movies a minute into the runtime. He has a very...very dry sense of humor and a bizarre wit. Some naysayers would say that his style comes across as pretentious. I do not get that vibe. Wes Anderson makes a movie as if he doesn't care if anyone else enjoys the movie, as long as he likes it. And I respect that level of commitment to its cause. With that in mind, not all gambles pay off, and this one did not click with me.The film certainly is memorable, but it is a style over substance film. It is possible for a film to have both an out of pocket framing device and a coherent narrative, but this film does not. At a certain point in the story a character echoes my final thoughts. \"I know it isn't much of a plot...there is no plot!\"",
    "58": "Pointless, unnecessary, and a visual insult throughout, it is really hard to comprehend why this movie has ever been made. With colors ranging from ultra pale to extremely vivid mismatched all the way, conversations and monologues entirely hollow and basically meaningless, and characters light-years away from any reality, wow, this is really, really bad even for an attempted satire. The \"high point\" is that the production value is there, which makes it even more staggering how people with any sense of business, or just simple common sense, thought that this was worth financing. This total and utter BS is an insult to the human mind. Brrrr.",
    "59": "This is what happens when a Director gets to that point in there career when they are allowed to create absolutely anything! In Wes's case, the result is Cinematically bizarre for the sake of being bizarre, narratively boundless, aesthetically it demonstrates the directors pure ownanism. \"absolute power, corrupts absolutely\" and to simply call this film \"Indulgent\" would be a complete understatement. A jazz musician once said, \"If I accidentally play a wrong note, it's doesn't matter, as I then just repeat it, people will then think I played it on purpose\" Wes the jazz pianist, is playing with us.

The movie contained hidden meanings, much like a painting or portrait.It also boasted some intriguingly subversive elements - A Native-American G. I., other Native-American references but Westernized, and kids finding themselves in inappropriate places, nuanced 'hidden' references to ADHD and AI, and more besides.I think Wes is probably one of the few directors out there who can break the 'fourth wall' yet engage viewers and drag them interrupted into his movie.A dash of sit-com style pacing and a dollop of witty storytelling made \"Asteroid City\" a highly engaging movie that will keep most people - and all Wes Anderson fans - glued to their screen.The finale chant \"You can't wake up if you don't fall asleep\" defined the soul of this script in more ways than one.",
    "63": "This is the worst movie I have seen in years. With a cast of Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansonn, Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton and others, I was expecting it to be either amusing or entertaining, it was neither. In fact I fell asleep twice during the film out of sheer boredom and that was the best part for me because it spared me even more of this dross.I presume the cost of making this movie was spent on the cast and what loose change left over in the budget was spent on the script probably written by a 5 year old. I felt Wes Anderson's was having a laugh at the expense of the audience. The last film I will ever watch of his.If I could have given it zero stars I would have and that would have been too many.",
    "64": "Self-indugent, self-important, and constantly annoying, Asteroid City is one wasteful ride with looping self-references in a rather pointless display of directorial legerdemain that, as mentioned, repeats its themes over and over and over for really no reason at all...but tries super hard to extract meaning from a meandering plot and a bunch of duality interactivity that at first seems mysterious and poignant but later is revealed to be claptrap added to impress those too tired to insist film should be used for some larger purpose, larger reason, than to show off the latest CGI integration technologies. Despite a plethora of fine actors, I found most of the acting so stilted as to be silly...deliberately silly, again to make some kind of \"deeper\" point so that pseudointellectuals could extoll the virtues of point and counterpoint in an artifical, stilted, cutsey-futuristic environment.",
    "65": "This film had me interested from the beginning. Straight from the start I felt the Wes Anderson signature vibe. The film is what you would expect from this director. Full of suprises and the unexpected. Something else I loved was the similarity between one of the side stories and Moonrise Kingdom. However the epilogue pulled me right out. Suddenly I wasn't feeling it anymore and, even though it fit the story, I felt betrayed. This is all relative ofcourse. The film was a masterpiece. The ending was just a little less. This film had me constantly wishing I could just consume it in one go instead of having to wait for the story to play out(in a good way).",
    "66": "As a long time Wes Anderson fan, I am saddened. The feeling I am left with is similar to that of Isle of Dogs, but amplified. I was hyped by the initial trailer with the incredible cast of actors and the ambiguous plot or lack thereof. Only to find out the trailer I saw wasn't trying to hide the plot, it showed it all. Meaning, the plot was less than thin (emaciated).I only remember 30 seconds of this film. It was such an overly-saturated pastel puddle of play-write pretence with no substance and it leaves you with nothing, no feeling. Did this really get an 8 minute standing ovation at Cannes?Experiencing this film was like edging, but for your emotions. Nothing happens in the middle of nowhere. That's it. Also, everyone's lips looked like they ate ghost pepper ice cream.",
    "67": "I don't get the score for this movie - not by a mile. The premise is cute - a story about a story. And at first I thought this might get interesting. But after a while it became obvious there was no story. Just nonsense strung together by boring characters and terrible dialogue. I actually fell asleep trying to watch it, and had to wind it back and continue. I shouldn't have bothered. I am also confounded as to the cast taking on this project. It was the cast that attracted me to this film, but I am shocked they signed on for such a piece of boring garbage. I am sure there are those that will like this movie simply because they somehow see it as artsy fartsy. But I want good story telling and goo dialogue. This movie has neither. What a shame.",
    "68": "Asteroid City is a Wes Anderson movie, which pretty much explains it.The story is chaotic, with a movie being embended into another and the whole mess is hard to keep up. To enjoy it, one should just roll with it.The performances, in addition, were pretty great, as the movie is star packed and even the younger artist did a good job with their characters.However, in the end, it was a movie that tries but fails. Even if you enjoy Anderson's eccentric movies and timeless aesthetics, it is not easy to like this one, as the story is boring and fells flat. Better stick with The Grand Budapest Hotel, where quirky was fun not stuffy.",
    "69": "\"Asteroid City\" (6/23/23, PG13, $46M boxoff, D/Wes Anderson) is a visually splendant, eye-candy film featuring high-contrasty pastel colors set in the American southwest of 1955 co-starring many familiar A and B-list names and that's about all that's good to say about this film that didn't break-even at the box office and here's why... Wes has his actors engage in WAY too much dialogue and excruciating exposition with little to no action or intrigue. He directs his actors to speak in monotone with little to no facial expressions - this guy is deliberately making a boring film! Many, many reviewers give Wes a pass but why?! If a film school student made this, they'd be told to seek another career because they just don't get the FUNDAMENTALS of film making! The story, the plot, the performances are all just white rice bland, there's absolutely no entertainment value in this except for its color scheme. 3 stars only for the art/set/visual contributors.",
    "70": "Wes Anderson has a distinct style. If you are unfamiliar with his style, you can still feel a different energy from his movies a minute into the runtime. He has a very...very dry sense of humor and a bizarre wit. Some naysayers would say that his style comes across as pretentious. I do not get that vibe. Wes Anderson makes a movie as if he doesn't care if anyone else enjoys the movie, as long as he likes it. And I respect that level of commitment to its cause. With that in mind, not all gambles pay off, and this one did not click with me.The film certainly is memorable, but it is a style over substance film. It is possible for a film to have both an out of pocket framing device and a coherent narrative, but this film does not. At a certain point in the story a character echoes my final thoughts. \"I know it isn't much of a plot...there is no plot!\"",
    "71": "Pointless, unnecessary, and a visual insult throughout, it is really hard to comprehend why this movie has ever been made. With colors ranging from ultra pale to extremely vivid mismatched all the way, conversations and monologues entirely hollow and basically meaningless, and characters light-years away from any reality, wow, this is really, really bad even for an attempted satire. The \"high point\" is that the production value is there, which makes it even more staggering how people with any sense of business, or just simple common sense, thought that this was worth financing. This total and utter BS is an insult to the human mind. Brrrr.",
    "72": "This is what happens when a Director gets to that point in there career when they are allowed to create absolutely anything! In Wes's case, the result is Cinematically bizarre for the sake of being bizarre, narratively boundless, aesthetically it demonstrates the directors pure ownanism. \"absolute power, corrupts absolutely\" and to simply call this film \"Indulgent\" would be a complete understatement. A jazz musician once said, \"If I accidentally play a wrong note, it's doesn't matter, as I then just repeat it, people will then think I played it on purpose\" Wes the jazz pianist, is playing with us. The one star I gave this film, is for the fact that Wes, at least is trying to find something new, new wrongs notes!",
    "73": "Few independent filmmakers have a style as unique and distinctive as Wes Anderson's, whose signature aesthetic is almost immediately recognizable upon watching one of his films. Yet his films are not just aesthetically engaging; they tend to be hilarious and well-written in a quirky, down-to-earth way. As a fan of his work, I was looking forward to \"Asteroid City.\" This retro sci-fi tale of a UFO/alien sighting in a 1950s desert town certainly delivers Anderson's expected vibes, but fails to pair the visuals and auteurist elements with an engaging, emotionally impactful plot or character development that is equally strong and/or effective.The film is a true ensemble piece, and doesn't have a clear main character. This would be fine if the wide array of characters involved were more compellingly written, but the screenplay treats their motivations as simply second fiddle to \"style,\" world-building, and more abstract themes. Thematically, the film also seems a bit inert, seeming to jump around in subtext without providing the plot context to justify it--including through the framing device of a play. Anderson's large ensemble cast generally does pretty well with the material they are given, but their actions feel removed from consequence or plot relevance to make us feel a lot fo their characters. The brilliant craftsmanship on display mildly offsets these concerns--from the outstanding production design, cinematography, costume design, and editing--which are well-done even by Wes Anderson's standards. Yet the lack of a comparatively developed plot or character motivations is a bit jarring compared to his better films, such as \"The Grand Budapest Hotel,\" \"Moonrise Kingdom,\" \"The Royal Tenebaums,\" and \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" Even the anthology structure in \"The French Dispatch\" felt more character-driven and authentic, and thus more conceptually engaging than this film. Make no mistake, Anderson is and has always been a creative visionary, and his fans should generally have a good time while watching this film. It's just a little bit unfortunate that the film comes off as more hollow and forgettable than it should, despite plenty of positive qualities as well. Recommended only to Wes Anderson fans. 6.5/10.",
    "74": "It is hard to think of a movie as underwhelming or as twee as Wes Anderson's 'Asteroid City,' a meandering, grandiose comic-drama as overlong as it is overindulgent. As it begins, we are told the film is in fact a televised production of a play by a fellow named Conrad Earp, which follows a ragtag bunch of misfits who gather on the isolated titular town to partake in a science convention. Among them is recent widower and war photojournalist Augie Steenbeck, who hits it off with noted actress Midge Campbell. Meanwhile, the actor playing Augie has doubts about his performance, and fears he doesn't understand the play.A fear shared by this viewer. 'Asteroid City' is a film packed to the rafters with nothing of note. The narrative is overloaded with unnecessary stylizations that distract rather than engage. Moreover, the switching back and forth between the play and the show about it is jarring throughout, while the overarching structure is alienating. It is difficult to immerse oneself in the world of the film as one is constantly reminded it is fiction. Similarly, it is no easy task connecting with the characters when the film they're in keeps telling us that they and their conflicts are imaginary.Additionally, Anderson doesn't fully explore any of the innumerable story threads he begins to unravel, nor does he properly develop his themes, whether they be about reality and fiction, the role of science and technology or the search for identity and belonging. He introduces thematic ideas in a superficial and inconsistent way, without giving them enough depth or resolution. This makes the film feel unfocused and incomplete, as it leaves the viewer with many questions and loose ends.For instance, he introduces the idea of a nuclear war looming over Asteroid City, but doesn't explore its implications or consequences for the characters or the world. He also introduces the character of Conrad Earp, the playwright behind it all, but never explains his motivations or his relationship with the actors or the audience. Moreover, he fails to conclude any of the various subplots in a meaningful or coherent way, seeming to prefer endlessly switching between different levels of artifice in a vacuum of self-satisfaction.Furthermore, the characters are all Anderson stereotypes dialled up to the max. We've seen the quirky neurotic Steenbeck before in projects like 'Rushmore' and 'Darjeeling Limited', while Campbell is essentially just Margot Tenenbaum with better hair, or any number of the beautiful, aloof ladies Anderson has given the world over the years. Each and all eccentric and mannered, the people that populate 'Asteroid City' feel like they were created by artificial intelligence trying to emulate Anderson's earlier, better movies.Likewise, the dialogue is your typical Anderson fare, full of cutesy phrases and obscure references that'll make grey-haired hipsters chuckle; though is a different breed from the likes of, say, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel.' For all its faults, that film had plenty of rapid-pace witticisms and verbal sparring matches, which 'Asteroid City' has a dearth of. The dialogue is largely uninspired and inane, when it isn't contrived and artificial, as it is whenever Steenbeck's son has to converse with anyone, or when Steenbeck and Campbell share their woes through their windows.Narratively, 'Asteroid City' isolates and irritates, while Robert Yeoman's striking cinematography is cartoonish and extravagant. Yeoman makes use of bright colours, symmetrical compositions and retro-futuristic props and costumes to create a distinctive, whimsical aesthetic that reflects Anderson's trademark visual style. The attention to detail on display is laudable, while the intricacy of the sets and staging is staggering. However, Yeoman's work also contributes to the tacky artificiality and lack of subtlety of proceedings, meaning that, instead of enhancing the mood or meaning of the film, his exaggerated stylizations serve only to distract. Additionally, the score-a jumbled mixture of 50's country songs and synthetic pop- is as forgettable and bland as saltless porridge.Though Anderson has assembled a truly awesome all-star cast, nobody is giving anything particularly interesting or challenging to do. Though Jason Schwartzman does strong work as the quirky, self-absorbed neurotic Augie Steenbeck, it's a role he's played dozens of times before in better projects and to greater effect. Similarly, Scarlett Johansson impresses as the austere Midge Campbell, showing her vulnerability in a way most nuanced and affecting; though is underutilised and ultimately reduced to a mere plot device.Additionally, Bryan Cranston does a half-decent Rod Serling impression as the narrator of the piece and Tom Hanks brings pathos and power to his all too small role as Steenbeck's father-in-law, though both characters are woefully one-dimensional. Also worthy of note is Jeffrey Wright, who's consistently amusing as a caricature of an army general, and Tilda Swinton, who engages in more of the jittery over-acting that has endeared her to so many. The rest of the cavalcade of stars are generally commendable, but have little to do in the face of Anderson's scant characterisation and unengaging narrative.In conclusion, 'Asteroid City,' like 'The French Dispatch' before it, is very much a case of style over substance. Anderson's best films- perhaps tellingly all written alongside Owen Wilson- have heart and soul to match their kooky characters and painstakingly intricate visuals. 'Asteroid City' is a heartless, soulless exercise in pretension; a meandering mess of a motion picture. Though it boasts some fine performances, there's very little on offer in 'Asteroid City;' and it's certainly not a place you'd want to call home.",
    "75": "Wes Anderson has always been a favorite director of mine. I have seen all his movies - but for me, the magic is gone.I feel like The Grand Budapest Hotel was his masterpiece. Where every aspect that makes his films special was at its peak. The characters, the cast, the sets and, of course, the visuals were up to an 11. His craft was perfected - and it's one of my top 5 films of all time.When I saw Isle of Dogs, I started to feel full. I felt like I had seen Wes's style a bit too much. And now this.I feel that Asteroid City is pretty bland. The visuals are fantastic - but we've seen this all before. Instead of a compelling lead who has an interesting problem to solve - we get several bland characters who are quirky, and that's it. The acting is great though. But it's not that funny nor intriguing.We were eight friends who saw this film together. Every one of us was pretty bored after a while. One of us really liked it though - but she had only seen 50% of a Wes Anderson film before. The rest of us felt... full.",
    "76": "This was a total disappointment from the start. The entire conceit, that it is a film within a play within a film is completely without interest. It seems to be a formal exercise in how far one can push a metaphor to the point where it has lost any meaning.I found myself falling asleep to it at one point when all the characters, each one looking into the lens, emote their lines without any emotional commitment whatsoever. The only one who seems to have any desire to project an iota of emotion, Scarlett Johansson, does her best to keep her audience interested, but even her attempt falls flat.There are numerous A-list cameos that have no reason to exist except to lend credence to the Auteur that Mr. Anderson has become. His obsession with proclaiming his own superiority leaves most of the cast cold, and even the best efforts by Tom Hanks and Adrien Brody cannot redeem what little story there is.The actors simply phone in their performances, particularly Jason Schwartzman, oddly enough, portraying a widower who does not grieve in front of his mismatched children, none of whom seems to notice their missing mother. Kudoes go to the three little girls who portray his daughters (blonde and blue eyed?) but who handle their roles like pros.Not much can be said for the rest of the cast, all of whom show up and portray their cardboard characters as best as they can, and the entire thing is missing any kind of heart -- it lasts way too long and by the time we have reached the anti-climax, we feel cheated out of any kind of feeling whatsoever.",
    "77": "Wes Anderson drummed up a magnificent cast. At least ten of them could carry a triple A movie by themselves. Unfortunately, Wes forgot that a good movie needs a good plot as well.The visuals are outstanding, almost every shot is also an award winning photo. The acting is superb. The setting is magnificent and almost everything about this movie is perfect.Everything but the plot. If you like humor, you'll like this film. If you come for the visuals, you'll love this film. If you're into acting, you'll have an excellent time. But if you want to be engaged? Look elsewhere.Dear Wes, your dialogues are hilarious and witty. Your plots lack substance. Work on your plots.",
    "78": "I saw 'ASTEROID CITY' yesterday...and I have a\nmixed feelings about it....\nAs usual, stylistically very impressive, with strong emphasis on ensemble work of actors, as it's usually happens in Wes Anderson's movies.When movie is considered ensemble piece the pressure of a film success falls on the shoulders of the director. In a normal narrative film the protagonist and antagonist often take the burden of film success on themselves, hoping that the audience will emphasize with our lead characters and their character arc, to be immersed in the story during the full running time.There is a risk however if the audience doesn't connect with performances the status of leading man or a woman is in jeopardy, with producers in the future not wanting to green light another film with actors, which were unable to handle the \"weight\" of the movie.This is why plenty of actors like to work on movies which offer ensemble feel. They don't have to spend many months on filmset, instead they come for few days, shoot their scenes and can move on to the next project. If their performance didn't work they are always supported by other quality actors, so it doesn't ruin the whole film. In ether way Wes Anderson's style always comes on top, as actors who work with him understand the particular speed of lines delivery, as well as dryness of the dialog.Stylistically it's very much what we expect from Anderson. Cinematography is more interesting then usual with a strong emphasis on production and costumes design. The camera movement feel bit more free then usual and yet the composition is always full of symmetry, which is the calling card of Wes. He even included few inserts (close ups of objects, which normally make thinks appear more cinematic) which for his filmmaking style is rather unusual. As well as few \"Dutch angles\", which make the audience feel sense of distorted reality in moments of surrealism.The color correction ranging from black and white to colorful over saturation is rather visually interesting.There is a lot of quality here, but I am afraid 'ASTEROID CITY' might not be everyone's taste, although fans of Anderson know what to expect and should have a good time.More casual viewers might feel like this film is a little stylistically disjointed.For me I appreciate what Wes was trying to accomplish and always admire his stylistic consistency, which has its benefits (you know what to expect), but also it's throwbacks, when Wes just like in this case is trying to explore a new filmmaking narrative techniques.Recommend! 👍",
    "79": "Described as a science fiction romantic comedy-drama and by trying to be a \"jack of all those trades\" is why it fails miserably at ALL of them, pick a lane will you Anderson!Once you get past the highly stylised presentation, it becomes a paper thin 'homage' to what exactly? ..to Anderson's own body of work!!!There's no interesting story to follow, so it rapidly becomes a sequence of disjointed and very tedious to watch sketches, where the novelty of the cartoon like colorised environment wears off quickly.Not the only one to ask..how can Anderson put together a cast THAT good and still end up with a complete dud? Spending $25 million making a movie (I'm guessing most of that went on the big name cast) so there's not going to be much left for anything else, you know, like good script writing..",
    "80": "As a diehard Wes Anderson fan I was lucky enough to preview this early and was excited to do so. I absolutely loved The French Dispatch and was hoping to see the same strong story telling.What I got instead was the complete opposite.Fans will be excited to learn that Wes has finally set out what his previous 10 films have been working towards - an actual play filmed as a movie.Afterwards I was left thinking that really what he captured was, a movie about a movie about a play about a play. And that's where the disappointment lies.No you aren't watching a story unfold about Asteroid City. You are watching a movie about the play based on the play of Asteroid City.All of the WA tropes are there - The dialogue is witty, the camera movement is uniquely WA, the celebrity status is tossed aside for silly fun, and the armature animation is great, as every fan wants from a WA film.But the narrative structure means that ultimately, there's no story. At least not one that matters.There's no arch. No heroes or foes. No obstacles to overcome. Nothing gets solved, and there's no real payoff. It's just a story within a story within a story and you the audience is expected to marvel at how terribly clever it is. It's incredible clever. But it's not very watchable.Diehard fans of Wes Anderson will call this a masterpiece, because they pretty much have to at this point. He's been making movies that tiptoe around them being a play since 1998 and he finally went all-in on this one.But this comes at a great cost, and the cost is this - ultimately it's just a series of scenes, one after another, that you don't care about.",
    "81": "\"An apocryphal fabrication\"Rather than the usual \"inspired by actual events,\" Wes Anderson's newest satire, Asteroid City, admits it's untrue, an especially important declaration for newbies to the Andersonverse. The deadpan take on America in the 50's as it responded to alien invasions via UFO's and the chaos of changing post WWII life including love is refreshingly honest, hopeful, and fearful. As it is not his best work, Asteroid shares endearing but minor chords with The Life Aquatic an The Darjeeling Limited. For me, the pinnacle of Anderson genius still is occupied by Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Grand Budapest Hotel, not Asteroid City.Armed with the blue sky of the desert and the stars of the cinematic universe including Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, and Tilda Swinton, to name just a few of the A-listers, Anderson and writer Roman Coppola get our attention with a form of cosmic exploration of the universe and the private psyche. The meta part of the film is framed in multiple ways such as a TV show within a movie within a play, or whatever.Per usual, Anderson tightly controls his mise en scene while the pastel coloring and acting are circumscribed by the apparent tacit agreement among the entire crew that minimalism is the mode, especially in speech where the aud must think about what's being said because actors barely reveal what they are about through body language and inflection. What to make of the strange romance between Jason Schwartzman's grieving Augie and Scarlett Johansson's suicidal movie star with attitude, is one of the challenges of a perplexed audience, which must factor in that the lead actors also play their characters in a New York teleplay (check out Brian Cranston's host as stand in for Edward R. Murrow).Why Tom Hanks's Stanley, a hip curmudgeon, carries a gun behind his belt may take a while to figure out in the context of characters looking for control in their lives. The participants in the Junior Stargazing convention, including Augie's \"brainiac\" son Woodrow (Jake Ryan), are blameless in their ignorance of a romantic life, relying on adults who are not capable of controlling even their little lives. Almost everyone is at least a bit lost as they face post-WWII love of the good life juxtaposed with dangers like the periodic mushroom out in the desert.As the complex plot winds down to a nostalgic relook at Spielberg's Close Encounters, the omnipresent pastel landscape and benign characters create a peacefulness for the film/TV production itself and the future as Anderson sees it in its multihued and vibrant human connections.For Asteroid, few visitors and 47 denizens care about the ancient crater outside their doors. For audience, the memorabilia include a diner, motor court, single pump gas station, and occasional cop chase. Most memorable of Anderson's quirky touches is the vending machine that sells miniscule plots of land.Besides the audiences' scratching their heads at Anderson's off-the-wall motifs, the aud must also consider that as the alien (Jeff Goldblum, who better?) leaves, the town is put in quarantine, which is like the audience itself stuck in a blended world of Anderson tropes.It's how to deal with the vagaries and beauties of life as they are, even in an arid Southwest Americana town, that gives this city a place for the audience to stop, but thankfully not forever.",
    "82": "Let me start off by saying: I have seen all of Wes Anderson's movies, some of them even multiple times.I can therefore certainly appreciate his quirky and unique style that made him a favorite at various film schools and among art-house movie lovers.Asteroid City feels like a very concentrated version of his latest movies in a bland pastel color desert setting:The black-and-white scenes in old TV formatting as well as the theatre-like setting reminded me of the \"The French Dispatch\" (2021) in particular.The newest movie doubles down on these \"theatre/stage play\" concepts, the sum of all parts unfortunately feels like a Wes Anderson overdose at times:Too many actors (the usual staple of big-name actors is larger than ever in this one, only Bill Murray seems to be missing), yet with no real lead role present and very little character development.The overall plot appears to be going nowhere until the credits roll - while the 1950's SF sub-\"plot\" also feels wasted when the Alien in his bright green UFO has a screen appearance about as short as the mythical 'Jaguar shark' in Wes' classic \"The Life Aquatic\" (2004).Asteroid City looks like Wes jumped the shark on his own ideas and prior body of work.Overall, the movie unfortunately feels too dry, stiff and boring to me (I would never write this about a prior Wes Anderson movie), even with its relatively short running time.Summary: Asteroid City will most likely only please and appeal to his most hardcore fans. Another IMDB reviewer summed it up perfectly with this headline: \"Nothing happens in the middle of nowhere\".4/10 , maybe rounded up to 5/10 for the (as always) beautiful decor and the immaculate attention to detail.I hope Wes returns to \"real\" film-making one day. I wanted to see a \"real\" movie by Wes Anderson, not a \"Wes Anderson doing Wes Anderson\" stage play in the desert.",
    "83": "Those who thought this was a \"boring\" film, should not be criticized for thinking this. Asteroid City is a visual wonder and treat of world building. Wes Anderson's productions are easily well-known for their impressive artistic visual structure and camera work. No disappointment in any of these categories. Featuring a massive array of talent which included a cast of 4 Oscar winners and 9 Oscar nominees, all giving solid theatrical-style performances. The setting is an absolute delight, and ranks as one of the top production designs in any Wes Anderson film. All the characters are carefully pieced, selected, and framed. All building up to a finale which I considered a pretentious, underwhelming, and slightly dissatisfying. It's hard to not see this particular story as Wes Anderson being unsure about which direction to go in. This was easily a story Anderson wrote/worked on while stuck in quarantine during COVID. The themes of loss, uncertainty, entrapment, search for answers, childhood into adulthood are all well-received and present. However, once the themes completely over take the narrative and substance, that's when the movie starts to disappoint. All these themes could've fit well into a story which resulted in a fun gimmicky alien invasion story, just like in \"Mars Attacks!\" which the film even makes a hidden reference to. Or a narrative which leads into alien abduction. Something....anything. Any conflict better than simply, \"they're all stuck in quarantine\". Another problem with Asteroid City is the story's massive number of characters. I love a story which gives every little character a unique presence to the story. Problem is, there are enjoying scenes with these characters, but when the movie ends I was still pondering if these scenes were needed. They added little to the narrative, took time away from the main conflict, and resulted in a unbalanced flow of the narrative. A successful balance of adults and children in the narrative was achieved far better in Moonrise Kingdom than in Anderson's effort this time. While the character payoffs do make sense, some of the key payoffs feel shallow than unsatisfying. The payoffs you would easily imagine the film going in simply do not happen. Asteroid City is easily one of my favorite world buildings in a Wes Anderson film. I was hooked within the opening minutes, and yet it felt unused to its full potential. Shame too, because this could've easily have been a great film.There is enjoyment to be found throughout Asteroid City, but in the end the descriptive words used regarding the narrative would have to include, \"underwhelming\" and \"cheated\".",
    "84": "\"Asteroid City\" immediately caught my attention, and for one specific reason: the talented (and unbelievably gorgeous) Sophia Lillis. Known for her captivating performances in previous films, Lillis brings her undeniable charisma and talent to the forefront once again in this new project. However, I must admit that I was left disappointed by the limited screen time she received in this particular film. Despite Lillis' undeniable talent, her role in \"Asteroid City\" felt unjustly brief, leaving much to be desired. And while Lillis undoubtedly made the most of her limited time on screen, it leaves viewers yearning for more of her presence and character development. And \"yearning for more\" seems like a good catchphrase for \"Asteroid City\" because, all in all, this movie feels like a classic case of style over substance.I'm not a Wes Anderson fan per se, but I love (with a capital L) a handful of his movies. \"The Grand Budapest Hotel,\" \"The French Dispatch,\" \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" and \"Isle of Dogs\" are all films that I feel very strongly about; \"Moonrise Kingdom\" and \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" are both movies of Anderson's that I enjoyed as well. So, given this context, my expectations for \"Asteroid City\" were tempered but still tinged with optimism. Unfortunately, the film ultimately fell short of my aspirations, leaving me feeling profoundly disappointed.\"Asteroid City\" failed to strike the emotional chord I had eagerly anticipated; Anderson is known for his signature style, characterized by meticulous visual compositions, whimsical narratives, and eccentric characters - all of which is typically wrapped around an engaging and emotionally resonant story. Unfortunately, \"Asteroid City\" is neither engaging nor emotionally resonant, with nary a story to be told.To say that \"Asteroid City\" felt like a non-movie would be a poignant expression of my disappointment. Anderson fails to deliver a cohesive and fulfilling cinematic experience with a narrative - if it can be called that - that feels disjointed and lacking in substance, leaving me cold, empty, and confused. Some reviewers are saying that the point of the film is that there is no point - if that's true and is what Anderson intended, it still doesn't make the movie any less pointless.Anderson's \"Asteroid City\" is not a crowd pleaser, at least in my opinion. It's not clever enough to make up for its lack of comedy, and it's not funny enough to make up for its lack of narrative. So what's left? While it is gorgeous to look at, all that one is left with are the typical Anderson cliches, except without an adequate emotional through-line to carry one throughout the film.",
    "85": "\"Do get to see Asteroid City while it's in town,\" said my friend, whose judgement I usually trust. \"...I think it'll be right up your street.\" I'm now left wondering whether my friend of 40+ years actually knows me at all!I don't think I've ever seen a film so totally alienating - and I don't mean the Brechtian kind of alienation (that, I could have got on board with). No, this was a calculated assault on the senses: Wes Anderson doing Wes Anderson to the max, just because he can, with no attempt to engage the audience on anything but the shallowest surface level.An OTT cartoon simulacrum of 1950s America, populated by 2-dimensional ciphers who speak in disconnected soundbites that ultimately say nothing that's actually worth paying attention to? As the basis for a 5 minute comedy sketch, it could have some merit ...but 1 hour 40-something? Get real!But that's the problem with this film, for me: it never gets anywhere near real. I notice that on its iMDb page, this movie is tagged as \"Comedy / Drama / Romance\". I can't imagine why, because it signally fails to satisfy the basic criteria for any of those categories. It's really - REALLY - not funny, contains none of the elements that qualify a narrative as drama, and as for romance... in order for there to be romance, there have to be actual, 3-dimensional characters in whom you can get invested, whose emotional journey keeps you engaged. You'll be a long time hoping to find anything so rewarding in this.Asteroid City is a vacuous exercise in quirkiness for its own sake. Had it been possible, I'd have gone to the box office and demanded my money back. As it was, I managed to last out to the one hour mark before giving up and walking out of the theatre - and I hardly ever give up on a movie!Y'know what really bugs me? It's entirely possible to set your action in a highly stylised, cartoon-like version of cold war America, make your screenplay a satirical critique of that society and those times - AND have central characters, storylines and relationship dynamics that are thoroughly engrossing and emotionally satisfying. Tim Burton managed it magnificently in \"Edward Scissorhands\" - why couldn't you, Wes?",
    "86": "Like every Wes Anderson film I enjoyed seeing it, or at least it generated some conversation afterward. What's it about? Maybe that's the wrong question. It travels along the edge of surreality from beginning to end and maybe the question should be, what's it trying to say. I think maybe the closest we get is toward the end when the main character, Augie (Jason Schwartzman) breaks through the stage-like set and in a fully surreal segment goes 'backstage'. He asks the Director (Adrian Brody) what this means, what are my lines supposed to do. He's told only that you're doing great, keep it up. I.e. -- life has no script, it feels a lot of the time like it's made up, there's no one to tell you what it means. That's about as good as I can do with it. Just as in Soul (2020), the message is that the Purpose of Life is to live it.As with all WA films part of the fun is to see all those well known actors bouncing off each other with quirky dialog (beyond quirky here). Scarlett Johanssen is entrancing. The flat delivery of lines, the sets that look like stage backdrops, the simplified color palette all stand out here as his trademarks. It's exquisitely tailored, but I'm not sure though how much further he can go on this stylistic path. Story, Substance, and Style -- if all you are left with is Style then you can admire it but what more?For me Anderson's high-water mark is still Moonrise Kingdom (2012). That one is a perfect, near-magical balance of story/substance/style with quirkiness to burn but deeply humanist. (And the finest end credits of any movie ever.) Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) is very fine too but at that point, style was already starting to win over those other essential elements.",
    "87": "Asteroid City is a new comedy, drama directed, co-written and produced by Wes Anderson, director of Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Grand Budapest Hotel. Writer Conrad Earp (Edward Norton) tries to live up to his fictional play. His play Asteroid City is about a grieving father Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman). He tries to tell his children about the loss of their mother, but has trouble doing so. Her father Stanley Zak (Tom Hanks) also thinks he should share this news with his children quickly. Furthermore, talk about this with his co-star Midge Campbell (Scarlett Johansson), to find the right way to share this news.With this film, Wes Anderson tries to make a more meta film in which a play is worked out, but the scenes behind the scenes can also be seen. Apart from this new way of storytelling, he is somewhat repetitive compared to his other films. For example, he portrays scenes in the same way as he has done in his other films. This film loses some of its unique sides. As in his other films, this film also contains a large film cast of various well-known actors. Many of these actors can be recognized, but due to the amount of actors, not everyone gets the same amount of time in this film. Jason Schwartzman and Scarlett Johansson get the most time in this movie to do something with their roles. In addition to the main story, there are also many additional stories that revolve around the main story, which, thanks to the amount, are not always easy to follow, so that the film can ultimately come across as a bit unclear. For fans and connoisseurs of Wes Anderson, the film can be a bit more entertaining and well-known. His comedy style also appeals to these fans a bit more. For people who are otherwise not very familiar with his comedy style, it can seem a bit strange. I rate the film as: it may look a little different. I rate the film as: it may look a little different.",
    "88": "\"Asteroid City\" is a comedy drama film written and directed by Wes Anderson (\"The Royal Tenenbaums\", \"Moonrise Kingdom\", \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\"). Featuring an ensemble cast including the likes of Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, and Edward Norton, it aims to satisfy hardcore fans of the director's work but alienates any potential newcomers.In a retro-futuristic 1955, playwright Conrad Earp's (Edward Norton) latest play \"Asteroid City\" is being televised with introductory information provided by its host (Bryan Cranston). The play follows a group of people who travel to the desert town of Asteroid City, Arizona in order to attend a youth stargazer convention. Among the attendees are widowed photographer Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman) and his teenaged son Woodrow (Jake Ryan) and three young daughters, actress Midge Campbell (Scarlett Johansson) and her daughter Dinah (Grace Edwards), General Grif Gibson (Jeffrey Wright), scientist Dr. Hickenlooper (Tilda Swinton), elementary school teacher June Douglas (Maya Hawke) and her class, and a singing cowboy named Montana (Rupert Friend). As the event begins, things seem to be moving smoothly but soon all the participants experience something unexplainable that change their views on life forever.If there were ever a filmmaker who could be considered the very embodiment of the term \"quirky\", it would be Wes Anderson. Well, at least one of the more notable examples. Ever since making a name for himself all the way back in 1996, Anderson has essentially crafted out his own unique world in each of his films, treating the audience to interesting camera placement, eccentric characters, unusual settings, and lengthy scenes of explanatory dialogue. For his eleventh film \"Asteroid City\", Anderson pays tribute to a bygone era of American history, that being the mythology surrounding extraterrestrial life on Earth in post-war times, in his signature style that may test even the most devoted fans of his handiwork.Where the film falls short of Anderson's better projects is in its uninvolving plot, something of which usually isn't a problem in his films. It is clear the film is supposed to be a story-within-a-story, as it is structured like how a play would look from the imagination of the playwright. Normally I enjoy this meta approach to storytelling, yet at no point did I ever feel fully invested in this story about all these people who just so happen to be at an astronomy convention at the same time. Though each of their stories are somewhat linked together, they never felt like they flowed naturally from one to the other. In many of Anderson's other films, there's an organic connection that links all the story elements into one whereas here it all seemed like the characters only interact with each other arbitrarily rather than for the benefit of the plot. As a result, the film just doesn't have that important emotional attachment to the audience and because of this, it is near impossible to care about anything crucial occurring throughout the story.Although the plot is distinctly lacking, the film at least has plenty of that unique Wes Anderson visual style for his fans to appreciate. Regardless of the overall quality of some of Anderson's movies, I've always loved the way each of them look. Similar to his previous film \"The French Dispatch\", Anderson cuts between certain scenes in black-and-white and colour as a way to distinguish between what is happening in the real world versus the play itself. Many of the shots that take place within the play are so meticulously set up that while I didn't care for what was happening at that point in the story, I still couldn't help but admire the attention-to-detail that must have gone into creating that particular look. One scene features a ferris wheel positioned perfectly symmetrical in the frame with the action taking place around it while another shows a group of children all sitting cleverly lined up listening to a musical act perform. Describing these shots doesn't really do them justice as they need to be seen to be properly acknowledged but I'm sure most Wes Anderson fans will understand where I am coming from.Another trademark of Anderson is his tendency to use large ensemble casts in almost all of his movies, and this one features probably his biggest yet. Actors ranging from frequent collaborators like Jason Schwartzman, Adrien Brody, and Willem Dafoe, to new additions like Tom Hanks, Maya Hawke, and Scarlett Johansson all make up this film's world of quirky characters. Unfortunately, as previously mentioned, the story doesn't really allow for most of them to leave any real impression. Usually I can remember several scenes in Anderson's films that involve even the most minor of character, not simply because of how well known the actor is but rather because they actually contribute something noteworthy to the story. Here, only a small handful of characters are truly memorable, and that's only due to the fact that the plot placed a significant focus on them as opposed to everyone else. There are no real scene-stealers nor are there any standouts among the new faces, instead most of the supporting cast are reduced to forgettable cameos that I had to look up afterwards to confirm if it really was them.With all of that said, I think the cast member who left the most impression on me was Jason Schwartzman as Augie, a photographer who attends the convention with his intellectual son. Augie is your stereotypical Wes Anderson protagonist; he's socially awkward, he feels emotionally distant from his family, and he craves approval from everyone around him. In any other case, I would have been bothered by a relatively one-note character like this but compared to most others in the film he was easily one of the most interesting. I enjoyed watching him interact with Scarlett Johansson's character Midge, a famous actress whose apathetic personality contrasts to his own longing for validation. These two had the most in-depth relationship in the whole film, which managed to hold my attention through even the blandest of scenes. Given the size of the film's already huge cast, this is quite a letdown.Even for the most dedicated fan of Wes Anderson, \"Asteroid City\" is bound to be a challenging viewing experience. While all of the signature visual flair and quirkiness is present as always, it lacks the most important aspect of all, and that is in its ability to emotionally connect with the audience. There just isn't enough reason to justify recommending this film to people outside of Wes Anderson completists, and even then there isn't a whole lot worth seeing that hasn't already been done before, only better. I remain hopeful that Anderson can return to form in a future production, but for now things don't look too promising.I rate it 6/10.",
    "89": "The title says it all, but I'll explain my rating. I was going to give this a 6/10, but deducted 25% and rounded it down to a 4/10. When people pay to watch a film on the big screen, it should fill the screen, not have black bars vertically and horizontally shrinking the picture to a 75% viewing area. Maybe keep the vertical bars for the black and white (of which I also can't stand) scenes, but go full screen format for the color scenes. That was my first annoyance and reason for deducting 25% off my overall rating.I was very generous to begin with giving this nonsense a 6/10. Listed as a comedy, drama and romance, there was nothing funny - no one even broke a smile let alone a laugh, barely any drama - unless childish drama counts, and the romance was lame for the few minutes there was any. This film had a barrel of A-list actors that pretty much wasted all their talents. They were only in this nonsense to attract viewership. Any actor can have zero facial expressions and a monotonic voice, and that's usually called bad acting. You can't create any real depth or character development with that type of terrible cast direction. Having A-listers act poorly doesn't make the film any more enjoyable - if anything, it becomes cringe and eyeroll-worthy.Then you have a lame attempt at a story within a story, that was executed poorly and was absolute nonsense. I would've enjoyed this more had the entire metatextual black and white scenes been omitted - not that it would have made the color portions of the story any better, but the entire film much less cringe having to sit through 105 mins of nonsense, some of that in black and white box-screen format. I know Anderson calls this art, but most of the world call it annoying.And the writing was just as annoying. It was tacky, boring and a pointless story that didn't connect, and when you've got such an immaculate setup with world class A-listers, that's really a shame. Even if getting rid of the black and white scenes, this film still needed to be trimmed down to make it a short film, and maybe then it would've been bearable to watch, with maybe somewhat of an engaging story in the short form.Nevertheless, my generous initial 6/10 rating was all for the beautiful sets, costumes and landscapes, and for the perfect cinematography, decent score and soundtrack, and for that sooo cute alien (only really good and funny part of the film). But because I got ripped-off on my viewing area by 25%, my rating has to reflect that, so it's a 4/10 from me. If you're going to see this, mute it, fast-forward all the black and white scenes, and play your favorite retro music over the colorful scenes to watch your own music video.",

    "91": "IN A NUTSHELL:\nIf you're a Wes Anderson fan, you'll get a kick out of his newest addition. He has such a unique, quirky style that entire YouTube channels have been devoted to him by visual artists who create movie trailers in his style. You have to see them! They're hilarious and awesome!This movie was directed and written by Wes Anderson, with additional writing help from Roman Coppola.The story is about a father who takes his tech-obsessed children to Asteroid City, a small, rural town to compete in a junior stargazing event. His wife, their mother, recently died which changes his world view forever. The story is presented as a play written by a famous writer.THINGS I LIKED:\nThe cast is absolutely fantastic and knocks it out of the park. It includes quite a few Academy Award winners and nominees: Ed Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Margot Robbie, Bryan Cranston, Tilda Swinton, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Jason Schwartzman, Live Schreiber, Matt Dillon, Jeffrey Wright, and so many more!I loved Ed Norton's fun accent.There's even an awesome Jeff Goldblum cameo, but don't blink or you'll miss it.I love how the camera frames things. Each frame could be a piece of art. Just soak everything in. It's all so clever and intentional. This is NOT one of those movies that you can have playing in the background while you do something else in the room; you HAVE to watch the screen.The introduction to the characters at the beginning was amusing. Pay attention to their descriptions.The director wanted to film out in the middle of nowhere that was flat. He looked everywhere and finally found a spot in southern Spain. I lived in Spain for 2 years and loved it!Bryan Cranston compared making this movie to an actor's dream camp. He loved having nightly banquets with all of the other actors.Bill Murray was going to be in the movie but he got Covid-19 right before filming, so Steve Carell stepped in to fill his role. Other than West Anderson's first movie, Bottle Rocket in 1996, this is the first movie not to feature Bill Murray.The color palette changes from black and white to fully saturated color with a retro look.The dialogue, like all Wes Anderson is witty and delivered dry.I actually like it when actors break the fourth wall. In this movie, they tell the audience, \"You can't wake up if you don't fall asleep.\"\nWhile extremely humorous, the movie is also heartbreaking.The music and sound effects are absolutely perfect.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nThe plot is thin, as if Wes Anderson were more interested in design and creating visually stunning scenes, but they're not really strung together in a story that the audience can sink their teeth into.There are so many characters without a clear protagonist.There's no villain or challenge that needs to be overcome.Shifting from color to black and white is an interesting director choice, but it felt more like a distraction than was necessary.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nFull frontal, female nudity (Scarlett Johansson was perfectly fine doing it but she also had to direct it because Wes Anderson was too embarrassed to do it himself. Then why did he even put that in his movie? Unnecessary. )To see my full review, go to my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!",

What movies he made and even that brought no recognition as to why there is so much hype about him or this movie.I get the feeling this movie will be more about internet mens than anything rememberable as a movie itself.I felt like a 1970s foreign film. Just bizarreOr if you gave a college film student millions of dollars to make their 1st semester film.And I think the biggest takeaway happens before you even go to the theater....there are just so many big name actors for this film to ever be goodOf all the surprises is the appearance of Tom Hanks. He could Star in anything. And he chose this.",
    "93": "The world is a stage within a stage within a stage, delineated by \"Acts\" and \"Scenes\" and some of our information about the solar system may no longer be *accurate. Damn it, Bryan Cranston, that wasn't your cue!I'm still processing the whole Theatrical device of those interstitial Twilight-Zone Hosyed by way of uh Actor's-Studio set pieces, the sort of contradiction of the utterly Fabtastical and pastel-color palette constrasting with hard black and whites and the hardness of Preparation to Acting. At first I was not sure if it all would click together since the cast are playing one set of roles in the color widescreen Asteroid City scenes and another in the B&W full frame ones. This is until it gets to that climactic scene (a certain actress you will also see this summer in a major movie crushes it in her one scene), and the whole Meta-textual Stage within a Stage had me.The longer I stand back and think of it, it's an awesome feat of social commentary mixed with auto-critique. It is like Wes Anderson doing a bit of Brechtian Confronting-the-Audience with the maleable aspects of Artefice, what we do with paranoia and Conservative-set ennui (hence the Ho-Hum and very arid 1950s); a bit of Close Encounters and how only a select few will get the communication part of it all; a bit of his own Familial Trauma Being Repressed comic-tragedia (suicide a brief CW), in this case what we do with grief and sorrow, and it is all of a piece. It's also the first Wes Anderson film in years I want to see again very soon.Oh, and it is one of his funniest and most succinctly, delightfully and begulingly surreal efforts; everything with Tom Hanks, Liev Schreiber and Maya Hawke with those kids had me giggling and holding back laughter and when I couldn't I guffawed loudly in the theater (when those cowboy singers break into the number that one student wrote about the alien and everyone gets to dancing, it's one of those magical movie moments - and something very much on theme with how we accept the transformation that art gives us).",

And if there is a single funny thing is this movie, and it was already the case for \"The french dispatch\", it's that it only seems to have been made to feed the conversations of a troop of pseudo-intellectuals, and God knows how many there are in this world. In the last minutes Mr Anderson even dares to talk about sleep, probably for the spectators who are still awake. But it's not really funny at all because the quality of 1 hour and 45 minutes of our life is in question. Maybe it is interesting for schools teaching cinematographic techniques, and sure it's an interesting movie for schools teaching the art and techniques of scriptwriting but essentially in order to teach what is certainly not to do. In the meantime let's read the comments of the pseudo-intellectuals who overrate this kind of movie here as usual. Of course it's a second punishment after viewing this movie but I assure you that it will never happen again : I'll never spend a single minute of my life again and I'll never spend a single cent of my fortune again to see a Wes Anderson movie.

That part stays very childish and leads to nowhere and nothing. Some scenes have their moment...but it all get lost in a fog of boring nonsense.The actors do their best but get nothing to work with.

I highly doubt you will find anything redeeming here. The movie is pulling away the fourth wall - from the start it tells you what it will show you. Of course even with that knowledge, there is much to see and much to discover. It is in the details that ... well it matters.The movie is able to entice you ... is able to pull you in and make you part of this weird world.

There is way more here though that one can comprehend or cherish and enjoy with just a one time viewing ... there is so much - and not just visually ... but on so many other levels ... if you relish in weirdness (full circle back to being a fan of Wes I reckon) ... well there is a lot get from the movie ... life is not structured (well most of it - we try to make it make sense as much as possible of course) ... movies can be ... but break apart, when things happen that no one expects either ...",
    "97": "I was a late bloomer when it comes to Wes Anderson films. I've pretty much seen everything he has done now, but that wasn't until about five years ago or so. It wasn't until The French Dispatch that I came close to nearly disliking one of his films. So clearly, with that statement, you can tell I really like, if not love a lot of them. Well, thankfully, Asteroid City is one of the better additions to his filmography in my opinion, but unless you know what to expect from his films, I'm never recommending this to a casual moviegoer. If you know, you know.Before I dive into what this film is about, just know that it's far easier to understand in the actual film, but I will do my best. Beginning with a Black and White television show about a writer working on a play about a small rural town known as Asteroid City, the film quickly jumps into that actual story/play being written. The film itself is the story within the story, but the walls between them eventually begin to break, creating a very unique film in my opinion. At its core, this is a film about a father and his children who travel to Asteroid City after losing their mother, to compete in a stargazing competition. The film becomes about a lot more than that and some of the revelations had me cracking up as well. Not only is this film well-constructed and different, but it's also hilarious.I usually find many places to chuckle throughout a Wes Anderson film, but this may arguably be his funniest to me. The witty/rapid dialogue that he's known for just hit me in a different way this time and I found it incredibly clever. The way certain characters respond to things or when someone would give a hilariously over-the-top monologue, I was eating it all up. The camerawork as well is spectacular, but I've come to expect that with his style that he never really strays from. I also usually find it distracting when too many huge actors/actresses are in his films, but this film is mainly about a core group, with a bunch of cameos here and there, which was nice and worked for some of the humour too.Asteroid City may end up in my top ten films of the year for 2023 because the dryness, visual aesthetic, great and quirky performances, and some truly hilarious and memorable moments all had my eyes glued to the screen. For a film like The French Dispatch, I actually remember checking the time on multiple occasions because it was the first film of his to bore me, and even though this film is just as dry, it was the far better script that kept it feeling alive and vibrant. The only reason I'm not going to give his one a perfect grade is simply due to the fact that I could've used a bit more at the end in terms of the story, but that also seemed to be the point, so I'll give it a pass. If you've seen a Wes Anderson film and have liked it in the past, I can't recommend this film enough. If you're someone who thinks the film looks weird just from the marketing for it, it's definitely not for you. I loved watching this one.",
    "98": "Asteroid City is way too eager to acknowledge how artificial everything is but within the play inside another play is an emotionally affecting and funny story about moving on from loss that finds Wes Anderson at his most existential. It continues the problems with The French Dispatch but thankfully also improves upon the strengths.The cast is somehow even more stacked than Anderson's last, which already felt like the most impressive cast ever. A collection of almost all of his regulars and some fresh faces who all fit into his world pretty perfectly. The most impressive is probably Tom Hanks whose manages to balance his usual Hanks energy with what's expected of a Wes Anderson character.Wes Anderson's direction is technically amazing. His ability to craft beautifully framed and staged images never gets old and they're filled with so much detail. In a very clever contrast to French Dispatch this film is excessively saturated which only enhances how stunning this film is from its very first frame.",
    "99": "Wes Anderson's sci-fi romantic-comedy romp may not be his best, but there is just enough brilliance in between the flatter sections of the script to generate some genuine cinematic emotion at portions of the movie.Following a star-studded cast of characters who head to a Nevada town for a stargazers' convention that quickly takes a turn for the extraterrestrial, the premise is instantly brilliant, providing a perfect testing ground for the kind of story which Anderson rolls out.Credit where credit is due, Anderson and co-story creator Roman Coppola's screenplay is ambitious, audacious, and creative, with a particularly intriguing structure that blends fiction with reality, taking multiple different formats and generating something unique as a result. However it also suffers from pacing issues, especially in the first act, where the focus of the story is unclear and the vast number of characters unable to make a proper impact on the screen.As a result, we are treated to a series of dizzyingly beautiful shots, in composition, cinematography, and production design, complete from the Anderson signature of smooth single-take camera moves, but none of which gel together properly into a cohesive movie until about halfway through. Once it does, however, this movie becomes exactly what it's trying to be, sophisticated and a finely detailed look at a long-lost world.The actors rarely extend the character beyond the script's quirks, and that only adds to the sterile feel of something pretty but ultimately pointless throughout the first hour.As it gains momentum, however, and as actors of a calibre of Jason Schwartzman and Scarlett Johansson get the chance to flex their capabilities beyond Anderson-stoicism, the movie starts to come together, and towards the end is a deeply thoughtful meditation on art, performance, the stories we tell ourselves about deeper meanings, and even about grief and existentialism.The music, provided by Anderson stalwart Alexandre Desplat, is also noteworthy in it's perfect encapsulation of the Anderson style, and his needle drops remain as joyously wonderful as ever.Although not close to his best, it is still a work of extraordinary originality, and a visual feast of intricate details and quirkily entertaining cinema. This will win Anderson no new converts, but surely anyone can appreciate the effort and thought put into this movie, though somewhat unwieldy and inefficient.",
    "100": "You might describe Wes Anderson's \"Asteroid City\" as the most Wes Anderson of Wes Anderson's films or even the most marmite movie ever made and I'm sure it's a film that will divide even his most ardent admirers. Personally speaking I'm still not sure where I stand on it; there is a lot here I liked and yet for about the first twenty minutes or so it seemed like a film I was destined to hate.To say what it's about would clearly be a waste of time since it isn't really 'about' anything. I've often described Anderson's films as being like a series of New Yorker cartoons brought to life but they were New Yorker cartoons embedded in some pretty decent storytelling. Here he seems to have dispensed with storytelling altogether and just given us the cartoons voiced by his all-star cast. For a good deal of the time it works though sometimes the 'cleverness' just falls flat.It's really another 'movie-within-a-movie' though as we are told by narrator Bryan Cranston at the beginning what we are seeing is a play in three acts, interrupted by inserts of 'behind the scenes' stuff. You could say the inserts represent real-life; everything else is the play with Anderson choosing black-and-white Academy ratio for the reality and widescreen and colour for the play which is set in the fictional Asteroid City of the title and where a group of junior star-gazers and others find themselves. The year is 1955, atomic tests are going on in the background and there's a spaceship and an alien on the prowl.To be honest it's probably the slightest of all Anderson's constructs but it's certainly gorgeous to look at and given that they have nothing tangible to do or say the cast are actually very good and it's often very funny. It's certainly a marked improvement on \"The French Dispatch\" but I still long for the days of \"The Royal Tennebaums\", \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" or \"Moonrise Kingdom\" where the actors not only had roles they could flesh out but where Anderson found a humanity in the clever wordplay and where the background stayed in the background. The way he is going now he may as well ditch the actors altogether and just film his admittedly eye-candy sets.",
    "101": "I've liked every one of Wes Anderson's movies, and to that I can now add \"Asteroid City\". Told as a New York teleplay, it depicts a small town in the southwest US in the '50s, famous for an asteroid crater, and the stopover for a number of people passing through the desert. But none of these folks have any idea what's about to happen.As with all of his movies during the past quarter century, Anderson centers the scene, with baroque pastels and quirky characters. Returning from his previous movies are Bob Balaban, Adrien Brody, Bryan Cranston, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Scarlett Johansson, Edward Norton, Tony Revolori, Liev Schreiber, Jason Schwartzman, Tilda Swinton and Jeffrey Wright, with newcomers Steve Carell, Hong Chau, Matt Dillon, Tom Hanks, Maya Hawke, Stephen Park, Margot Robbie, Fisher Stevens and Rita Wilson. Noticeably absent is Anderson regular Bill Murray (although that might be for the best, considering the recent allegations against Murray).Basically, it's the sort of movie that makes one appreciate cinema. Clever scenes and lines all the way through make it one to enjoy, even though we understand the serious aspects. You gotta agree that this sort of movie is more watchable than any movie where Tom Cruise does a bunch of stunts for two hours.",
    "102": "I really looked forward to Asteroid City from the day it was announced, and it didn't disappoint.In typical Wes Anderson style, this movie looks fantastic with great attention to detail the set dressing and wonderful colors.Just like The Grand Budapest Hotel, it is a feast for the eyes!The story has a lot of subtle, quirky humor and it hits just the right spot every time.It is a story within a story, and I just wish the whole movie was set in Asteroid City instead of going back and forth between behind the scenes and what was happening there.The breaks and changes in style weren't always a hit for me, and I found myself hoping to return to the desert city asap...And the performances... Those were terrific by all! What a cast!Left the theater with a smile on my face!",
    "103": "Asteroid City (2023) is a movie my wife and I watched at the Alamo Drafthouse last night. The storyline follows the making of a movie called Asteroid City and what went into the writing of the storyline, selection of the cast, how the movie came together and what's it's purpose.This picture was directed by Wes Anderson (Moonrise Kingdom) and stars Jason Schwartzman (Rushmore), Scarlett Johansson (The Avengers), Tom Hanks (Big), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Jeffrey Wright (The Batman), Liev Schreiber (Scream) and Edward Norton (Fight Club).The way this movie is put together is pure magic. You feel like you're drifting through a fairy tale. The storyline is interesting, unpredictable and does a great job capturing your imagination. The sets, props, backdrops and attire are all beautiful. The camera angles and cinematography is top notch. The cast is brilliantly constructed and everyone delivers a tremendous performance. There's so many subtle details to grab your attention. I loved the road runner. The conclusion has magnificent depth but also leaves room for interpretation.Overall, this is a fun trip with a worthwhile story and entertaining characters. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.",
    "104": "Wes Anderson's unique style is all over the film Asteroid City. While watching it, I vacillated between being confused with the storyline and captivated by the eye-candy cinematography. I love the coloring of this film, and like Asteroid City as a whole but, despite the large cast and fascinating moments, the film left me blank.The story starts showing a dad, Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman) with his three daughters and one son, visiting Asteroid City's western meteor crash site hosting a sort of \"space camp.\" The family is attending a science competition. While there, an alien visits everyone attending the science competition. This extreme world-changing event causes Augie, his family and everyone else at the competition to quarantine, leaving them stuck.I really like the style of this film, the cinematography and set designs. The film takes place in 1955 and really embodies this time era. The bright colors of Asteroid City are mesmerizing but become overwhelming at times. Throughout the film, there are cuts in the storyline that make it confusing. It seems that Wes Anderson tries to tell the author's story while telling the story of Asteroid City at the same time. I like the storyline, although the multi-narrative detracts from the story itself and makes it difficult to understand where the story is going. The ending does piece together the straggling parts and everything becomes a lot clearer. After the first hour there is a turning point where I could better understand what was going on. I love the cast! I am a huge fan of Maya Hawke who plays a teacher named June. I love Maya's ability to be so in touch with the roles she plays and I really love her performance in this film. Scarlett Johansson also delivers a great performance as the character, Midge who is an actress in the film. Both Jake Ryan as Woodrow Steenbeck and Jason Schwartzman as Augie Steenbeck nail their performances -- their characters are surprisingly very alike, both having awkward, yet interesting personalities. There are so many other incredible actors in this film like Tom Hanks who plays the grandfather of the three girls and their brother. I love the performance of the three young daughters -- they are so funny and adorable.The film's message is about scientists and artists finding a common place and longing to connect. Be aware that there is brief nudity, smoking and suggestive material.I give Asteroid City 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. Asteroid City releases in theaters June 23, 2023. By Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!",
    "105": "So I think Wes Anderson is at the point in his career where's just fully comfortable with and has settled into his style. For some that's gonna be overwhelming since that style is so specific and there were shades of that for me in Asteroid City but I think I just decided to fall into his aesthetic and for that I really enjoyed the unique ride that this movie was.I just found it to be very comfortable as a viewing experience, it's gorgeously shot, extremely fast paced (perhaps sometimes to its detriment) and while I wouldn't say the characters were amazingly well realised I still really enjoyed their interactions. It's got a lot of the subtly wholesome and touching moments like his best work has and while the story was a bit more abstract than I expected it to be I was still consistently interested in it and I'd be interested to see what new details I could pick up on with a second viewing.I will say that the framing device of the story was something I wasn't fully on board with. I'd be interested to hear Wes Anderson's justification for it because I'm not ashamed to admit I just didn't really get it and is just a strange fit with the overall narrative. I don't really see what it has to do with the rest of the film and it makes certain moments feel more artificial as a result.It's definitely not that film I expected it to be but I wouldn't say that's a bad thing and I do see why this has turned out as one of his more divisive films. It's ambitious and it's strange but I'd rather see Anderson fully commit to his style rather than try some kind of half way hybrid. It doesn't reach the highs of The Grand Budapest Hotel or The French Dispatch for me but I'd personally still rate this pretty highly in his filmography and I think I'm at the point now where I'm gonna be excited for whatever he puts out because I know it's not gonna be like anything else.",
    "106": "This was a very interesting movie about a widower and his family whose planned vacation at an asteroid-struck stretch of desert near an atomic-testing facility leads to wonder and joy for the characters and audience. The performances were key to the movie's success and varied in authenticity but reigned in a strong overall appeal. Taking place in the 1950s, some of the actors had performances which seemed too modern yet were able to shine in all the right moments throughout the film. A combination of black & white and color cinematography lent the film a textured viewing wherein the b&w was used for narrative interactions which told the telling of the story's history through the eyes of its writers and creators. The children in the movie of course were pretty brilliant in their acts and the invention exchange was super fun. Tom Hanks delivers a little brilliance in parts, as does Ed Norton and Steve Carrel. Jeffrey Wright comes through with a great performance as the General, Maya Hawke as the Scout leader, and Scarlet Johansson puts on her full effort as the make-believe actress/mother. Wes Anderson returns to colorfully themed-style drama like The Life Aquatic or Moonrise Kingdom, which is welcome after his more melodramatic movies like The Grand Budapest Hotel. Asteroid City was beautifully shot and imagined and fun to watch, although slightly on the dry side and somewhat forced in certain parts.",
    "107": "Wes Anderson strikes again with another intriguingly quirky and eclectic film.Like any Anderson film, the characters are the real highlight. They are all just so entertaining. The witty dialogue, the distinct personalities, the striking costumes, all contribute to create a brilliant collection of characters that are just fun to spend a couple of hours with.Of course these characters wouldn't be anything without the talented cast that brings them to life, and Wes assembles maybe his best ensemble yet in Asteroid City. Schwartzman and Johansson steal the show for me, but there isn't a single dud in the bunch.Visually this film is just a treat from start to finish. I could wax lyrical all day about the colours, the costumes, the framing, the camera work etc etc. But to put it succinctly, Wes Anderson knows how to make a visually arresting film and Asteroid City truly showcases this.My only real critique is that I think this is definitely one of his weaker stories. That's not to say it isn't funny or dramatic or entertaining, because it is definitely all of those things, but I just didn't find myself totally hooked with the concept and execution.All being said though this is a minor criticism. There is more than enough to make up for this and, while I don't think it is one of his best, Wes Anderson once again proves that he is a shining light in the world of cinema.",
    "108": "It's a satirical comedy set in the Nevada-California desert in 1955. The film follows two storylines: a play about a Junior Stargazer convention that includes awards for outstanding astrophysical science projects and a television program about the writing and production of the play. The film casts the play in a unique color palette; it portrays the television show in black and white.The movie is an ensemble production with many characters. Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman) is a widowed war photographer with his son, Woodrow (Jake Ryan), and his three young daughters at the convention. Woodrow is competing in the science project event. Augie's father-in-law, Stanley Zak (Tom Hanks), arrives after The Steenbeck car breaks in Asteroid City.Other primary characters include the motel manager (Steve Carell), famous actress Midge Campbell (Scarlett Johansson) and her daughter, Dinah (Grace Edwards), and the TV show host (Bryan Cranston). Other notable actors, including Edward Norton, Matt Dillon, Willem Dafoe, Margo Robbie, and Jeff Goldblum, appear in minor roles.\"Asteroid City\" follows events before the Stargazer event, which a branch of the U. S. military hosts. The event is interrupted by a non-worldly event. The hosts' response is a satire on the U. S. military, though I'm not sure that's the main point. Overall it's a campy look at 1950s North America.Whatever the intent, \"Asteroid City\" is hugely entertaining. Try to read all the signs, labels, and vending machines as quickly as possible, as they disappear quickly. The odd color palette was initially distracting, but it grew on me. Don't dig too deeply for meaning. Just enjoy.",
    "109": "I absolutely loved the pastel blue dessert backdrop and the look of this Wes Anderson film. I found myself busting out laughing with all of the great lines...and well done on the quirky characters!My favorites were the three not princesses...vampire, mummy and fairy sisters. That was so great.The story is of a playwright who is writing a play about a photographer who's car breaks down on the way to drop off his daughters at their grandfather's while he attends his son's junior stargazer event in Asteroid City, avoiding telling them that their mother has passed away. In a strange turn of events an alien comes to collect the asteroid giving the city it's name...and then the whole town is quarantined by the government.The city is a character in and of itself...with motor court bungalows that have a vending machine that dispenses plots of land the size of half a tennis court, a garage with exploding engines, a diner, a ramp to nowhere, atomic testing, and the asteroid museum. The cast is phenomenal...I particularly like Jeff Goldblum in his role. The soundtrack is wonderful and so appropriate...right down to the western band who misses their bus.I enjoyed the film right down to it's random police chase with shootout. I laughed so much more than I anticipated and that was a big win in my book. I highly recommend this for those who enjoy the quirky and have a good sense of humor.",
    "110": "Within 20 minutes of watching Asteroid City, I found myself thinking of a quote (I think it was Neil Gaiman but I'm not sure) - \"Don't leave the reader/viewer feeling regretful.'Unfortunately, I felt regret throughout this entire film. Regret for having paid to see it in cinemas. Regret for having expected a storyline. Regret for having wasted my Saturday evening.There is no plot of any substance. Nothing propelling the viewer through the film. Not once did I find myself wondering, 'Ooh, what's going to happen next?'Some of it looks pretty. And the all star cast is visually appealing but ultimately wasted (I felt no emotional connection with any of them).It's just a bunch of scenes stuck together. If there is a theme or lesson to be taken from the film, you have to drag it's body out, lifeless and limp, from underneath the mess of monotonous and rambling dialogue.I'm sure that Wes Anderson super fans will think it was all very clever. (That's fine - I've enjoyed some of his films in the past.)But as an average movie goer, I think that Asteroid City was a total w*nk fest.If I had been watching this at home, I would have turned it off after 20 minutes. The only thing that kept me in the cinema was the regret of having already paid for the ticket.",
    "111": "\"Asteroid City\" is a 1955 TV documentary directed by Edward Norton, starring Conrad Earp, a fictional playwright. The film opens in black-and-white and square Academy ratio, narrated by Bryan Cranston. The film tells the story of Carter Earp's theatrical play, \"Asteroid City,\" presented by Anderson and company in stunning color and widescreen. The film is a unique and entertaining addition to the Anderson family's filmography. Anderson's latest film, \"Space Camp,\" is set at a remote Western meteor crash site, reminiscent of a Space Camp. The setting is beautiful, with beautiful scenery and building layouts. The Space Camp is home to a group of gifted teens who are preparing to steal futuristic inventions, including a disintegration ray. The kids bring their own drama, with Woodrow (Jake Ryan) being the oldest son of war photographer Augie Steenback (Jason Schwartzman). Woodrow finds an immediate affinity with fellow \"Junior Stargazer\" Dinah (Grace Edwards), the daughter of movie star Midge Campbell (Scarlett Johansson). Other Stargazers have different issues, such as Ricky Cho (Ethan Josh Lee) and Clifford Kellogg (Aristou Meehan). Anderson's storytelling skill is remarkable, with the movie keeping the narrative flowing throughout its 105-minute running time. The film's seamless execution of characters and their unique traits makes it a captivating and engaging experience. The Asteroid City portion of the film follows the grief of Augie, his father-in-law Stanley, and the Steenback children. The film is interrupted by two visitations by an alien spacecraft, which forces them to stay in the desert for at least another week. Augie and Midge compare notes, and Midge concludes that they are \"catastrophally wounded people who don't express the depths of their pain because... they don't want to.\" Johansson is beguiling in a half-enigmatic, half-quietly-blunt mode, while Schwartzman's performance is revelatory. Schwartzman, who has appeared in Anderson's films since Max Fischer, shows a new maturity in this role, playing a helpless man rather than a stunted adolescent. He also plays the actor playing Augie, which Earp initially reluctantly cast, allowing him to forge two discrete romantic affiliations, making his performance both tricky to execute and pleasurable to watch. Wes Anderson's movies often lack heartfelt melodrama or realistic human emotions. Instead, they feature intricately crafted doll's house dramas with boxes-within-boxes narratives and arch, satirical conundrums. The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) are examples of his best work, while Isle of Dogs (2018) showcases his off-the-wall stop-motion animation. The Darjeeling Limited (2007) and The French Dispatch (2021) are examples of his quirky work. Anderson's latest film, The Corduroy Fan, is a detached, Swiss watch-style meta-puzzle with interlocking stories and a stellar cast. Fans will be dazzled by its meticulous imitation-of-life-in-miniature visual aesthetic, but the film's overall experience can be a mix of amusement, curiosity, and irritation.",
    "112": "This movie is vibrant and bursting from every corner of the big screen. The set design in every scene is a gorgeous feast for the eyes. It's almost too much to take it all at once.This trip will be worth many happy returns.The cast is as amazing as it is generational and legendary.The dialogue as witty and sharp as ever in a Wes Anderson production.It's so very exciting. A Wes Anderson alien invasion movie as only Wes Anderson could make it.The wonderful music waltzes well with this western picture.Slim Whitman. Tex Ritter.Chaparrals running wild on the arid landscape.It's a Wes Anderson film. You know what to expect and your expectations will be met.This is one of the best movies of 2023.",
    "113": "Watching 'Asteroid City' I realize I'm starting to have a problem with Wes Anderson's movies. Each of them is an aesthetic delight and a demonstration of cinematic stylistic virtuosity. They are full of humor and almost every sequence includes reverences to artists of the past and references from the history of film and other arts. On the other hand, the detachment between style and emotion is so programmatic in Anderson's latest works that I don't really know how to watch his films. If I take them as an aesthetic or cultural experience, I can't help but leave the viewing happy. Trying to follow the plot or resonate with the characters, however, fails me. I don't even know if the story in 'Asteroid City' has any importance, or if the wrapping in which it is presented to the viewers is what matters. The latter is probably the most accurate, but here many of the references - to the theater or films of the '50s in America - are lost on the foreign viewer and - I suspect - on a large part of the American audiences as well.What would 'Asteroid City' be about? Is it the story of a playwright writing a play in the 1950s of victorious post-war America but which were also the years of atomic experiments and of political hysteria and witch-hunts? Or of the actors who stage this show according to an acting method that seems to completely detach the text from the emotions? Or maybe it's the story itself, of a newly widowed father meeting a starlet actress, science-loving kids, the government lurking to steal their inventions, and aliens coming to inventory a boulder that fell from the sky millennia ago after? In the end, however, all this seems to matter less, because what I remember 2-3 days after watching it is mostly a Wes Anderson visual experience, with sophisticated sets in idyllic advertising colors, with many details full of fantasy and humor, with an approach that seems so light and superficial that I can't help but suspect that maybe I should take it seriously, but I don't know how.As usual in Anderson's films, the list of stars who appear on the screen could be impressive for ten different films, including both some of the actors who permanently accompany his films and some new but famous names. They all seem happy to be puppets in the American director's vast fantasy theater. The favorite theme lately seems to be American history seen from an aesthetic and very personal perspective. As a spectator I was also happy but also a little confused. The danger of mannerism hangs in the air.",
    "114": "I've previously considered myself a fan of Wes Anderson, from Bottle Rocket - shaky, but promising, to Rushmore \"indie-gem\" to the \"masterpieces of Royal Tenenbaums and Life Aquatic, through the decline of an Amex advert, Darjeeling, Moonrise and other increasingly forgettable material.This is the latest of the slow grind into mediocrity. This one stars the well known comedic lead of Scarlett Johansson! Who deapans! Her way through the script. I'm guessing the comedy element is the anachronism of her not! Running away/from/to explosions and cgi whilst wearing spandex!There's a whole bunch of other A-list stars that really aren't known for their \"comedic\" roles either and they'll probably be great in their next roles with material that hasn't lazily lapsed into self-parody.It might be worth mentioning that the camera work is particularly at fault her, the \"Anderson-style\", the left-right shifts, pans in-out are really the first grating signifier that Anderson has slipped into a rut, it's just so formulaic and it should be something comfortable, familiar and warm, but the cast is little other than \"hey, I know a bunch of A-Listers! Now!\" irregardless of whether they actually work in context or bring anything to the film other than \"I worked on a Wes Anderson film\".It's just tiring, there's nobody to warm to in here, it all feels incredibly by the numbers - as if Anderson gave a cursory guiding hand to a script and directorial eye governed by A. I.\nThe colour palette was the most enjoyable element for me, but other than that, I'm sure Anderson has a bright career in advertising ahead of him. Perhaps Coca Cola will rebrand in pastel tones.",
    "115": "Qes Anderson being Wes Anderson. Tons of actors and stories jammed packed into 1 hour 45 minutes movie. Even weirder, the most memorable character was Jeff Goldbloom's alien for me, and he was only have 1 line throughout the movie for a mere 1 secondAll actors in this movie can act and can act extremely well, even the supporting actors we don't usually noticed, which told me how Wes Anderson is a complete control freak in creating his scenes.If you asked me what's wrong with Asteroid City as a movie? Nothing, nothing at all. Every scene was perfect, every actor did their job. The script had interesting story to tell. Everything was perfect.The annoying thing was it's not memorable. My favorite Wes Anderson's film is The Grand Bucharest Hotel and it's very, very memorable. I still recall how quirky and fast paced it is, for a Wes Anderson's film. Asteroid City has too many famous faces and it stained the script. It's full of guesses, who's that and what the scene tried to tell the audience. I ended up being lost in how the script went out the window at several scenes and jumped back in in the next.Not Wes Anderson's best. However, it did put a smile or 2 on my face.",

    "117": "I will see it as a triumph, if I can discourage at least one person from watching this ridiculous pile of garbage they call a movie.I just came back from the screening of this movie in the cinema and witnessed half of the audience fighting sleep and the other looking at each other in disbelief.The movie has no plot, there is no storyline, no motivation, nothing. What I assume was supposed to be a piece of modernistic abstract art turned out to be one or the most pointless movies of all times.Do not be fooled by the amazing names in the cast (which is what fooled me to expect to see a great movie tonight).In summary, if I should describe this movie in one word it would be \"pointless\".",
    "118": "Although I found Astroid City to be enjoyable to watch & thought provoking, I did not find it half as funny as the rest of my theater. Wes Anderson's first truly sci-fi movie shines in a way many modern sci-fi movies fail, by not saying or explaining everything out loud. The movie's strengths lie in its questioning, a non-circular plot, and evaluation of grief.This cast shines but the character development was especially uneven for what I come to expect with a Wes Anderson film. For a man who can make The French Dispatch, a collection of short stores, with such powerful individual characters, the supporting characters could've been done better.I found Schwartzman & Johansson excellently paired with an awkwardly strong chemistry to match Anderson's often deadpan tone. Steve Carrell & Tom Hanks are given the best comedic roles and deliver the funniest lines of the film.Anderson's ability to showcase childhood love is woven more subtly into this plot with a standout performance by Jake Ryan, who plays Woodrow, Schwartzman's character's son. The science experiment fair type thing was a fun plot device and not familiar for the sci-fi genre. The child acting in this movie is very strong.This is not my #1 Wes Anderson movie but I had fun and enjoyed it.",
    "119": "Asteroid CitySome of the other reviews on here are quite bizarre in their conclusions. It is self-evident this big budget art house movie lacks most of the key components of any dramatic production. Plot, narrative impetus, compression of reality, and an arch like structure with empathetic characters.It had all the depth of a detergent advert but without the purpose, any sane watcher in the picture house would have walked out about 10 minutes in.Over stylised without a plot, shallow characters and a bizarre wordy script purporting to be a comedy, the minimum bar for a comedy being six out loud laughs per movie, I didn't laugh once! This is perhaps Wes Anderson's weakest movie thus far, perhaps he should give up as he appears to have lost the plot!Overall, I'm giving this 1 outta 10. It didn't hold my interest and I hated it with a vengeance.",
    "120": "Wes Anderson's \"Asteroid City\" is a stellar comedy featuring an impressive ensemble cast backed up by really solid piece of scriptwriting. Anderson's film can be listed among the more unique comedies released this year with its heavy emphasis on metanarrative framing and clever dialogue evoking all kinds of philosophical themes and existential questions about life in the universe. The film's casting is nothing short of brilliant where every actor manages to play their role to perfection. As with Anderson's other directorial efforts, the quirky deadpan humor of films like \"Asteroid City\" may not be to everyone's liking and beyond the film's thought-provoking themes there doesn't seem to be much of an actual plot underneath its exterior which is why some might walk away from Anderson's film not feeling entirely satisfied with its conclusion. That said, the film still deserves accolades for its gorgeous-looking visuals where the set pieces used for the fictional rural town of Asteroid City look aesthetically pleasing and perfectly reflect the film's stagelike world. All in all, \"Asteroid City\" is well worth checking out and qualifies as yet another solid addition to Wes Anderson's filmography.",

Even earlier then the US audience, which usually never happenens.Wes Anderson takes a very interesting perspective of Nihilism.Asteroid City is a film displaying the human art of being able to interpretation.EMBRACING THE UNKNOWN.A extensive and extremely deep film, made to make the audience leave the cinema with deep thoughts about our lives, what something alien to us is and what dreams truly do to us. Are we free we when we dream? What world is the genuine one?And aswell to raise discussion, a philosophical film creating questions about our extraordinary existence.ASWELL EXPLORING \"WHATS THE MEANING OF LIFE?\"\"You cant wake up, if you dont fall asslep\" You cant see the truth if dont dream.What is real? Where do thoughts came from?WES ANDERSON IS GENUINE GENIUS!A FILM YOU NEED TO WATCH AT LEAST TWICE!Wow! Among the best cinematic experience i have ever had. Though a very unique one.The way this film is put together is pure magic!UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU HAVE SEEN BEFORE!\"Astroid City\" is a satirical, deep, fresh and curious journey by Wes Anderson taking his views of trying to answer and display one of our biggest question of humanity.This is a film you will remember. It is severely unique in a very powerful and positive way.With its intelligent and poetic manuscript, \"Asteroid City\" is a film in a act of theatrical storytelling stageplay (a story within a story - a TV special about the fictional play), which is very interesting and unique to see.I truly enjoy its uniqueness, its style and atmosphere and its a extremely complicated and innovative film guided by typical Wes Anderson humor and use of the smooth filming movements.BEAUTIFUL FILMING!Does it get more Wes Anderson then this? Fantasticly well made down to the last detail! Love its wierd, surrealistic and unique beautiful style, but its that who makes it so good! How good and deep can a Wes Anderson really get? Fantastically good!Cinematography and manuscript is among the most beautiful, poetic, philosophical and intelligent and among the best ive ever seen!Visual is more then stunning! Perfection and beauty!Music is soo good and really fits into the film!LET THE OSCARS RAIN DOWN ON THIS GREAT PICTURE!This is a film you certainly wont forget and although its wierdness, there's something thats standing out and dare to have its own way of processing the story. Its the uniqueness and creativity that makes it so extremely good and satisfying for the brain and the eye to watch!Genuinely, one of the best, interesting, warmest and funniest films all of the last 20 years. A UNIQUE MASTERPIECE OF MODERN CINEMA!Truly one of Wes Anderson's best films! It really makes you think and it really is a film that sticks to you and really stands out!PURE AND GENUINE CINEMATIC ART!Stylistically extremely impressive!A film you have to see! Totally recommend it to everyone! ONE OF THE BEST FILMS IVE EVER SEEN! MARVELLOUS! STUNNING!At the end it will make you ask, whats really the meaning behind life itself?I think Wes Anderson wants to say, with this filmes, that we all are playing our own characters in life, reading lines that are confusing. He wants to show its something beautiful creating something that sometimes doesn't make sense, as life itself. And i don't really think anyone's supposed to get it to 100%, because even the actors who plays it dosent even understands the play itself.He has managed to capture what makes us human, the tiny quirks of humanity, as well as larger questions and larger emotional themes.Im totally calling this the most innovative, beautiful and creative film ever made!A film that deserves being watched multiple times! A theatre experience like no other!Dont trust a second on the bad ratings! Watch for yourself! A must-see!",

Do you like any (or all) of the previous descriptions, then go ahead and \"enjoy\" this new Wes Anderson flick.The bad: I was a huge fan of Wes Anderson's earlier movies, but unfortunately he has become a gimmick of himself. He used to make really enticing, quirky and original movies, wherein the characters (however quirky) were still REAL. They were characters I could sympathize with. But now he has made monotonous, droning robots out of his characters in this movie, who speed read nonsensical dialogues. Such a shame. And almost an insult to us viewers.\"You cant wake up if you dont fall asleep. You cant wake up if you dont fall asleep. You cant wake up if you dont fall asleep. You cant wake up if you dont fall asleep. You cant wake up if you dont fall asleep\".Does the above litelral quote out of this movie sound like an exciting final to you? Of course NOT. But that's how this movie ends, with all the characters droning out these above words in repetition. It's annoyingly boring. It's artsy fartsy. Wes Anderson has completely lost the plot!I hope director/writer Wes Anderson somehow regains his former muse and goes back to making movies wherein the characters are real and humanlike again. But unfortunately every director has got a constrained window of time in which he produces real memorable classics. Wes Anderson should have won an Oscar for \"Grand Budapest Hotel\", but since then his star director's reputation is fading quikcly. Such a shame.Such a shame as well for the brilliant actors who are starring in it and who are all acting really terrific by the way. THAT must be said. The acting is really top notch. The movie though is NOT! A real disappointment for me, who is a big fan of the EARLIER Wes Anderson movies...",
    "125": "Wes anderson's True Stories for the Hotel Chevalier + The Darjeeling Limited-combo lovers who grew up in/doing (musical) theater (aka me).The way Anderson explores and expresses grief and the grieving process speaks to a pointed part of my soul that makes me feel less alone in the world. Asteroid City felt like the culmination of a lifetime of exploration and rumination over what it means to be human and exist on earth populated with diverse personalities big and small.The three little daughters are quite possibly my favorite Wes Anderson characters to ever exist, I love them fiercely and dearly like they are of my own bone and blood and cannot wait to spend time with them again.Technically stunning, the sets x the costuming x the hair x color story x the production design are meticulous and exhilarating. Care imbued into every tiniest detail, eliciting rousing emotion from the most unexpected moments and objects. Love Wes Anderson for always giving us a full course dining experience at the theater. It's so fun to watch him play with all the tools he has acquired in his creative toolbox and find new ways to experiment with medium and form. Truly inspiring to see the growth and expansion throughout Anderson's career culminate into this beautifully executed motion picture about love, curiosity, creativity, relationships, passion, discovery, humanity, the world around us, and life itself.Warmest thanks to Letterboxd for inviting me to an early screening, to Focus Features for organizing with Letterboxd, and to the nice man who moved over to let my mom and me sit next to each other in the assisted seating area because I am currently on crutches with fractured extremities.Asteroid City is out in select theaters 16 June 2023 and everywhere on 23 June 2023 (by focus features).",
    "126": "Asteroid City would make for a great double feature with Nope! (Absolutely insane that two summers in a row we've gotten personal auteur-driven alien invasion movies that are analogs for our need to find more beyond our own existence and how that relates to the creative process, both released under Universal too.)\nAnyways...I know I'm in the minority here, but Asteroid City is one of Wes Anderson's very best films! Or at least, it's his best in a while! Isle of Dogs and The French Dispatch were okay, but this was the true return to the Wes I've been missing! And it was so refreshing to see a real Wes Anderson project rather than all of those parodies of his style made on TikTok or with AI. This is some of the most interesting work Anderson has ever done - I appreciate the bold swing of this movie coming from Wes Anderson at this point in his career, and really, after seeing this movie you really can't say Wes Anderson is just parodying himself. It's easily him at his most metamodern, which won't work for everyone, but I just ate it up! It's a very existential film and something that I am still ruminating on days after seeing it. In the film, a flawless ensemble of different characters are connected by a celestial event as they question their place in the universe, and seek truth in art and meaning in their lives. The film offers a cosmically perfect blend of Anderson's distinguished style but with deeper and more profound work than we've gotten from him as of late. Production design, cinematography, and score are expectedly Wes Anderson (meaning they're terrific).Asteroid City is Wes Anderson's meditation on the endless search for meaning in life and art. The movie gets at something pretty profound about art and its ability to speak to those who are creating it, even when they don't even understand what exactly it is that they are creating. The writer in the movie doesn't understand what he's writing, the actor doesn't understand the character he is playing, and the character he is playing doesn't even understand his own grief. But, as Jason Schwartzman's character's character says: \"my pictures always come out\", which I think is Wes Anderson saying that as long as you create something that honestly comes out of you no matter how confusing or strange it is, the beauty in what you are trying to make will find it's way to shine through. There's something beautiful in making a piece of art that doesn't make sense because perhaps that reflects what is mysterious or confusing about life itself. It seems to try to capture the effect that we are all actors in our own lives, playing parts, and reading lines we don't fully understand in an ongoing pursuit of meaning. Anderson offers comfort by saying even if you don't understand what you are doing in this life, you're doing it right, you just have to trust that you're doing it right.There's been a lot of movies lately where filmmakers are examining what compels them to make the art that they make - movies like The Fabelmans, Nope, Babylon, Empire of Light, and Bardo - and although some people don't like this trend, what else can we expect from filmmakers when we are asking them to be honest and tell stories about their experiences. I really don't like when people call these films self-indulgent - if you're an artist who's been doing this for decades, that's what you've been living, and for someone to tell that experience only feels natural. So why not just let yourself sit back and enjoy Wes Anderson's examination of the act of creating art? It can be quite enjoyable, intellectual, and of course, very visually pleasing.I genuinely can't explain how obsessed I am with the visual splendour of Asteroid City. I always love the way Wes Anderson plays with framing, aspect ratio, and colour - and once again he knocks it out of the park here! This might be the most alive Wes Anderson's camera has ever felt. There are so many lovely moments spent just weaving around the set in all directions. The set was actually amazing and of course, Anderson's use of mise-en-scene is unparalleled, and I adored the soft blue and orange colour palette as well! I really can't get over how open this film is visually and thematically!Detractors will say Asteroid City is more of the same from Wes Anderson - the singular auteur doubling down on his stylistic and thematic hobbyhorses, with help from a largely familiar cast of characters. In a lot of ways, they'd be right. From its witty kids to its perfect palette, the film is full of Anderson signatures. But more than mere repetition, Anderson's latest is a culmination - a lining up of the stars to produce the rare piece of art that's both masterful and unconscious, confident and curious. It's a film about searching for meaning - in art, in life, in the stars - and one that's crucially content with not reaching too hard for any meaning at all.Plus... any movie with an actual road runner in it is bound to get a thumbs-up from me!",
    "127": "Like with a few other top directors, I always want to see what Wes Anderson is creating. I've been hooked since Bottle Rocket. He's one of the few auteurs left whose style is instantly recognizable.As much as I love many of his movies, they're invariably much more about style than substance. There's almost never any real message or philosophy underlying the beautifully created, but highly artificial, visual style. His other trademark is the cool, deadpan acting he requires, which causes the lines to feel more satirical and absurdist.As far as this 1950's period piece, there isn't much to say beyond the fact that WA has taken his normal style and cast of characters and played it with a highly meta angle. It has its moments. The best way I saw another reviewer sum it up was that it \"is the cinematic equivalent of cotton candy.\" It is beautiful, carefree, entertaining, but not amounting to much.I'd put this next to last in WA's ouvre. I would not recommend it to non WA fans. I hope it is a coincidence and not a trend, but I think his last 2 films are among his 3 worst. But, I'm looking forward to his next.",
    "128": "What a waste of 1 hour and 45 minutes! After seeing the cast list I was expecting a great movie, I mean come on, Tom Hanks, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson, Ed Norton, Bryan Cranston, Liev Schreiber, Willem Dafoe and Matt Dillon.... This was starting to look good. How wrong I was.I don't like giving up on a movie unless it really gets so bad that I can't handle it (For example: The Bombing with Bruce Willis).After 5 minutes I started to think that was going to be terrible, but I persevered to give it a fair go. In hindsight should have gone with my first instinct.Not quite sure the point of the movie and if it was meant to be a 'comedy', it was a lame attempt. How it currently has a 6.6 IMDB rating is beyond me, perhaps all of the cast and crew were instructed to leave a positive review?I gave it a 2. One point because it wasn't the worst movie I have ever watched and a bonus point because it had Margot Robbie (even if it was practically a cameo appearance). Disappointing that Tom Hanks agreed to this one, hopefully this is not a sign that his movies will slowly get worse from this point on (Like the train wreck of Bruce Willis' final movies) :(",
    "129": "The French Dispatch was an enjoyable film, but it's my least favorite in Wes' collection. Jumping back and forth frequently, small stories that didn't seem to become the sum of their parts, etc.At first, I thought Asteroid City was going to be more of the same. It did hop back and forth between the playwright's creation and the play being acted out itself, but it didn't feel as frantic as it's predecessor did. The playwright side of the story had a bit of ambiguity to it that had me scratching my head in terms of how it meshed with the actual story events, but it didn't get in the way very much.That being said, this film is an absolute gem. I need another rewatch to see how the pieces become more cohesive but the acting was brilliant, the set pieces rival some of the finest Anderson visual flair throughout all of his films, and Asteroid City itself felt like a remote, cozy locale with a bunch of characters that arrived there through various walks of life. The movie was so incredibly visual at times that I found myself getting lost in the scenery and missing some of the dialogue and story points. Grand Budapest had a similar way of captivating fans and I'm glad to see Anderson's cinematic form continuing in that style.",
    "130": "Wes Anderson is not a director I'm well-versed in, in fact the only other one of his movies I've seen besides this are Fantastic Mr. Fox, one of my personal animated favorites, and as I continue to cross more titles off my 2023 watchlist, Asteroid City comes along, a movie I heard was pretty terrible, however, idk what all those people were on about, Asteroid City is a great and as I said, brainy film.Taking one of the most stacked casts of this year, I'm not kidding, this cast rivals that of Oppenheimer with household names such as Steve Carell, Willem Dafoe, Jason Schwartzmann, and Scarlett Johansson, Asteroid City does a great job applying an extremely smart screenplay over 1 hour and 45 minutes, really begging the questions and themes of life beyond earth.And it's full of rich and great performances, most notably from Schwartzmann, Norton, Johansson, and Dafoe, all getting their moments to shine, along with a bit of Bryan Cranston, Mr. Walter White himself.A-",
    "131": "This is a film that perhaps hasn't quite got the impact of its titular asteroid. Anderson presents a range of human experience and leaves the rest open to interpretation. It's cinematic poetry with a high barrier for entry.Indeed, Wes Anderson's latest offbeat foray into whimsical contemplative existential dread and man's search for meaning is a portrait of a self-contained microcosm of human society - an allegory for human mundanity, excellence, plight, awe, and wonder all bundled into one. And perhaps, a dash of Anderson's self-indulgence in what could be seen as a pet project, to an extent.There's an iridescent Kodak-coloured chop suey of philosophy, aphorisms, and snippets of ideas going on here in the proverbial bowl of Asteroid City. A range of cartoonish characters are played by a gold-plated ultra-cast (Hanks, Johansson, Swinton, Robbie, Cranston, Carell, Goldblum) that holler, gesticulate, and wax Americanisms and charming idiosyncrasies.The film (unfortunately) reads more like a book or catalogue of short poems than a motion picture, it's as if the script and plot sounded incredible on paper but proved hard to get onto the cinema; in this outing, Anderson's creative ambition is perhaps too much for cinema, and budgets, to accommodate - just as most well-written books notoriously can't be fully realised on the big screen. Instead, a TV series might've given Anderson more scope to get across his message.Scenes in Asteroid City, divvied into acts of a play, aren't apparent enough to make sense from intuitive viewing alone, leaving the cinema-goer with the assignment of having to unpick and piece together an underlying latticework of allegory and metaphor. So no, this film won't handhold, and it's probably best suited to diehard Wes Anderson fans who'll watch this multiple times, do background reading, and at last extract the full value and punchline the film is getting at. If you don't want that in a film, look elsewhere. If you do, it's actually a three part film, and by that I mean you probably need to watch it at least three times.An exercise in cinematic poetry.6.8/10.",
    "132": "TLDR: After watching five 1/10 movies and reflecting on the terrible state of the silver screen, I was really looking forward to the 11th Anderson's offering. Sadly, I was disappointed. A movie that takes itself far too seriously while pretending that it's not, its weak script isn't saved neither by its remarkable cast or cinematography.Indeed, the film looks incredible thanks to the 35mm cinematography of Yeoman, who makes the camera an actor of its own. Playing with focal length, pushing the color to the point they look almost washed out and oversaturated, and filming the whole thing on dollies with pans, tilts, even using windows to echo previous split screened scenes, the outcome nears perfection.Unfortunately, it feels repetitive and even at a fairly short runtime of 1h35 m, viewers will be relieved to see that act 3 is to be played 'without interruption'.The set design is lush, and likely the most detailed set I've ever witnessed. The minutia borderlines on the OCD, and the movie maintains perfect continuity from its first frame to its last. Film nerds rejoice, this is one where you'll look up the lens manufacturer. Splendid use of focus pull , the whole thing is laser-sharp and airtight without feeling too artificial or cartoonish.Some complained this was 'overwhelming' but I didn't sense that at all.The ensembles cast is as surreal as the film, starring Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Jason Schwartzman, Bryan Cranston, Jeffrey Wright, Steve Carell, Hope Davis, and Maya Hawke, Margot Robbie, Liev Schreiber, Hope Davis, Matt Dillon, Willem Dafoe, and Jeff Goldblum.Despite this all star cast, the quirky, deadpan style of delivery feels rehashed and self-derivative. As many pointed out, some characters seems directly lifted from previous Anderson films and plugged in this one.But what I found unforgivable was the tone of the film. There's a certain fedora-tipping pseudo intellectualism to it, and at times, one has to wonder if the viewers are on the joke, of if they are the joke.This is emphasized by the completely straightforward script, which has no hidden depth whatsoever, leaving us to decipher - what exactly? What did we watch? What was the ooint? This is no \"Godot\" however, and it feels, like many have pointed out, that it's high time to for Anderson to reinvent himself the way LVT did.4/10 for the amazing photography.",
    "133": "If you asked me to summarize \"Asteroid City\", I couldn't do it. I left the theater with no real idea what it was I watched or how it was supposed to make me feel.There were a few chuckles here and there, and it looked nice enough, but I like movies that have an actual plot and not a series of disjointed vignettes with no narrative through line.I have never walked out of a theater before but tonight was the closest I've come. The high point of the evening was my popcorn, because there wasn't anything redeeming going on with the movie itself. The actors did the best with what they had, which wasn't very much.I guess if you like Wes Anderson's style, you might find the movie tolerable, but if this is an example of the type of movies he puts out, I will avoid them.",
    "134": "Normally when you think of a film that's fifty percent you think that it has a strong ending or strong start and is missing the other half. Plenty of films go that way with either a magnificent start that fizzles out or a dull start that you have to endure to get to the exciting second half.That isn't what I mean.The 50% is that it has a majestic cast that any film would be proud to have a fraction of, it has stunning visuals that demand attention and it has a great director whose attention to detail is fascinating to watch.The 50% missing is the plot.It's missing a coherent plot. The one we are given regarding a tv show about a film about a play that's about a competition set in a desert where an asteroid landed isn't a plot. It's a series of small jokes that aren't funny.Watched it, gave it 5 for the cast etc and left the other 5 off due to lack of substance over style.",
    "135": "Writer-director Wes Anderson has lost his way, and this film proves it. I realize that the auteur's signature style of filmmaking is an acquired taste, and, to his credit, he's made some fine pictures over the years. But this one is not among them. In fact, contrary to many of the inexplicable claims that this is his finest release, I'd contend just the opposite. It's arguably his worst, a meandering, cryptic, unfocused piece that's so muddled you'll need the assistance of a search party to find your way out of it (that is, if you even care by the time the end of this overlong mess rolls around). The director appears to have become so enamored with his own eccentricity that it doesn't even seem to matter to him whether or not viewers are on the same page as he is. Admittedly, this offering once again captures Anderson's singularly stylish look with a stunning production design and gorgeous cinematography. But that's all it has going for it, and that's unfortunate given the phenomenal cast he has available to him. What's more, despite his proficiency in creating superb visual style, he's forgotten about pairing it with meaningful (or even interesting) substance. Its incomprehensibility and inclusion of bits that are there just for the sake of their own whimsy seriously undercut any effort to make this an intelligible work. In short, \"Asteroid City\" is yet another major disappointment in what is turning out to be a dreadfully dismal summer movie season. It's likely to appeal only to diehard fans of the director (and maybe not even a lot of them this time out). If you're on the fence about this one, consider the following two telling tipoffs: (1) when no one in the theater is laughing at what's been billed as a comedy, that should speak volumes about it (as happened at the screening I attended); and (2) when you consider how aggressively and ubiquitously the distributors have been promoting this film in ads on TV and the internet, it's obvious they're trying awfully hard to peddle shabby, substandard merchandise. This is a huge waste of time and money; don't squander yours.",
    "136": "Visually, compositionally, Wes Anderson is without peer, and any individual shot out of his latest film will make practically every other movie released this year look like a provincial teenager's first TikTok video. Everywhere you look the details are never-endingly exquisite and hilarious, and my eyes haven't experienced so much pleasure since the last Wes Anderson flick. He's the only director left standing that I will still pay to go to a cinema to see.The downside is that the story itself is awkward, convoluted, flimsy and whimsical - flimsical, if you will - and it's often hard to follow or care about what is going on, especially in the larger story arc, which flits between a black & white 1950s TV production and the glorious technicolor of the main story. I would have been perfectly happy to have lost the needlessly distracting B&W sections, as they add very little in the long run, and sap the energy and pace of the rest. The clever story Anderson is trying to tell here could work, but he doesn't have a strong enough grip on all the narrative and character elements to convey it in a clear and emotionally engaging way, so there are parts that feel more of a private joke or a personal fancy than a work made for the wider world. It could be I'll think differently about that on further viewings, but I would expect it to still be the case that this is what weakens the film the most.The ridiculously stellar cast is dazzling, but there's just too many famous faces here for one film to do them justice: newcomer Tom Hanks is a great fit but woefully underused, and something similar could be said for Steve Carell, Tilda Swinton, Matt Dillon, Jeff Goldblum, Margot Robbie, Hope Davis, Bob Balaban and Willem Dafoe, all of whom are most welcome sights, but simply aren't onscreen long enough to convey anything of real substance, and they all deserved more fleshed-out roles they could get their teeth into.For the first time in a Wes Anderson movie there is some rather obvious diversity hiring in the casting department (presumably in order to meet the new qualifications for an Oscar), some of whom work better than others, but the returning Jeffrey Wright and Tony Revolori are both excellent, and Ethan Josh Lee is a good new addition to the family.Bryan Cranston and Edward Norton get more screen-time than most, but the first feels like a walk-on guest spot in a TV sketch show and the other looks somewhat lost in the confusing shuffle. Jason Schwartzman is, of course, the perfect Anderson avatar, and Scarlet Johansson is, for the most part, very dependable too. Liev Schreiber fits in surprisingly well, and the running gags with his son Aristou Meehan are perhaps the funniest high points of the film.-----All in all, it's hard to know how to rate this: it's definitely one of the weakest Wes Anderson movies, but for all the undeniable flaws in narrative it still gives me more joy to watch than just about anything else modern cinema has to offer, and I think it likely by December I'm still going to regard it the best thing I've seen all year. So that's odd.7.2/10.",
    "137": "It's happened. Wes may have pushed the boundary that it has snapped. Like all his films if you dont like his style, then just bypass because this will just rubber stamp it. As we follow a writer and his play about a grief striken father and his family descending upon a fictional city for a brainacs convention.The problem lays ostensibly with the script (i cant believe im saying that). Its so pretentious that it doesn't know if it's a comedy, drama or even science fiction. Granted there are moments that work and bring a genuine smile, but it's all too few. The cinematography is always a plus in an Anderson film, and that is true again here.Yes the cast is stellar but that doesn't mean it's going to work, hardly any of them get to actually challenge their range, with some just wasted. Scarlett Johansson probably to only genuine exception. This is a typical Wes Anderson story, its just he may have out Wes'd himself.",

    "143": "This is a film that perhaps hasn't quite got the impact of its titular asteroid. Anderson presents a range of human experience and leaves the rest open to interpretation. It's cinematic poetry with a high barrier for entry.Indeed, Wes Anderson's latest offbeat foray into whimsical contemplative existential dread and man's search for meaning is a portrait of a self-contained microcosm of human society - an allegory for human mundanity, excellence, plight, awe, and wonder all bundled into one. And perhaps, a dash of Anderson's self-indulgence in what could be seen as a pet project, to an extent.There's an iridescent Kodak-coloured chop suey of philosophy, aphorisms, and snippets of ideas going on here in the proverbial bowl of Asteroid City. A range of cartoonish characters are played by a gold-plated ultra-cast (Hanks, Johansson, Swinton, Robbie, Cranston, Carell, Goldblum) that holler, gesticulate, and wax Americanisms and charming idiosyncrasies.The film (unfortunately) reads more like a book or catalogue of short poems than a motion picture, it's as if the script and plot sounded incredible on paper but proved hard to get onto the cinema; in this outing, Anderson's creative ambition is perhaps too much for cinema, and budgets, to accommodate - just as most well-written books notoriously can't be fully realised on the big screen. Instead, a TV series might've given Anderson more scope to get across his message.Scenes in Asteroid City, divvied into acts of a play, aren't apparent enough to make sense from intuitive viewing alone, leaving the cinema-goer with the assignment of having to unpick and piece together an underlying latticework of allegory and metaphor. So no, this film won't handhold, and it's probably best suited to diehard Wes Anderson fans who'll watch this multiple times, do background reading, and at last extract the full value and punchline the film is getting at. If you don't want that in a film, look elsewhere. If you do, it's actually a three part film, and by that I mean you probably need to watch it at least three times.An exercise in cinematic poetry.6.8/10.",
    "144": "TLDR: After watching five 1/10 movies and reflecting on the terrible state of the silver screen, I was really looking forward to the 11th Anderson's offering. Sadly, I was disappointed. A movie that takes itself far too seriously while pretending that it's not, its weak script isn't saved neither by its remarkable cast or cinematography.Indeed, the film looks incredible thanks to the 35mm cinematography of Yeoman, who makes the camera an actor of its own. Playing with focal length, pushing the color to the point they look almost washed out and oversaturated, and filming the whole thing on dollies with pans, tilts, even using windows to echo previous split screened scenes, the outcome nears perfection.Unfortunately, it feels repetitive and even at a fairly short runtime of 1h35 m, viewers will be relieved to see that act 3 is to be played 'without interruption'.The set design is lush, and likely the most detailed set I've ever witnessed. The minutia borderlines on the OCD, and the movie maintains perfect continuity from its first frame to its last. Film nerds rejoice, this is one where you'll look up the lens manufacturer. Splendid use of focus pull , the whole thing is laser-sharp and airtight without feeling too artificial or cartoonish.Some complained this was 'overwhelming' but I didn't sense that at all.The ensembles cast is as surreal as the film, starring Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Jason Schwartzman, Bryan Cranston, Jeffrey Wright, Steve Carell, Hope Davis, and Maya Hawke, Margot Robbie, Liev Schreiber, Hope Davis, Matt Dillon, Willem Dafoe, and Jeff Goldblum.Despite this all star cast, the quirky, deadpan style of delivery feels rehashed and self-derivative. As many pointed out, some characters seems directly lifted from previous Anderson films and plugged in this one.But what I found unforgivable was the tone of the film. There's a certain fedora-tipping pseudo intellectualism to it, and at times, one has to wonder if the viewers are on the joke, of if they are the joke.This is emphasized by the completely straightforward script, which has no hidden depth whatsoever, leaving us to decipher - what exactly? What did we watch? What was the ooint? This is no \"Godot\" however, and it feels, like many have pointed out, that it's high time to for Anderson to reinvent himself the way LVT did.4/10 for the amazing photography.",
    "145": "If you asked me to summarize \"Asteroid City\", I couldn't do it. I left the theater with no real idea what it was I watched or how it was supposed to make me feel.There were a few chuckles here and there, and it looked nice enough, but I like movies that have an actual plot and not a series of disjointed vignettes with no narrative through line.I have never walked out of a theater before but tonight was the closest I've come. The high point of the evening was my popcorn, because there wasn't anything redeeming going on with the movie itself. The actors did the best with what they had, which wasn't very much.I guess if you like Wes Anderson's style, you might find the movie tolerable, but if this is an example of the type of movies he puts out, I will avoid them.",
    "146": "Normally when you think of a film that's fifty percent you think that it has a strong ending or strong start and is missing the other half. Plenty of films go that way with either a magnificent start that fizzles out or a dull start that you have to endure to get to the exciting second half.That isn't what I mean.The 50% is that it has a majestic cast that any film would be proud to have a fraction of, it has stunning visuals that demand attention and it has a great director whose attention to detail is fascinating to watch.The 50% missing is the plot.It's missing a coherent plot. The one we are given regarding a tv show about a film about a play that's about a competition set in a desert where an asteroid landed isn't a plot. It's a series of small jokes that aren't funny.Watched it, gave it 5 for the cast etc and left the other 5 off due to lack of substance over style.",
    "147": "Writer-director Wes Anderson has lost his way, and this film proves it. I realize that the auteur's signature style of filmmaking is an acquired taste, and, to his credit, he's made some fine pictures over the years. But this one is not among them. In fact, contrary to many of the inexplicable claims that this is his finest release, I'd contend just the opposite. It's arguably his worst, a meandering, cryptic, unfocused piece that's so muddled you'll need the assistance of a search party to find your way out of it (that is, if you even care by the time the end of this overlong mess rolls around). The director appears to have become so enamored with his own eccentricity that it doesn't even seem to matter to him whether or not viewers are on the same page as he is. Admittedly, this offering once again captures Anderson's singularly stylish look with a stunning production design and gorgeous cinematography. But that's all it has going for it, and that's unfortunate given the phenomenal cast he has available to him. What's more, despite his proficiency in creating superb visual style, he's forgotten about pairing it with meaningful (or even interesting) substance. Its incomprehensibility and inclusion of bits that are there just for the sake of their own whimsy seriously undercut any effort to make this an intelligible work. In short, \"Asteroid City\" is yet another major disappointment in what is turning out to be a dreadfully dismal summer movie season. It's likely to appeal only to diehard fans of the director (and maybe not even a lot of them this time out). If you're on the fence about this one, consider the following two telling tipoffs: (1) when no one in the theater is laughing at what's been billed as a comedy, that should speak volumes about it (as happened at the screening I attended); and (2) when you consider how aggressively and ubiquitously the distributors have been promoting this film in ads on TV and the internet, it's obvious they're trying awfully hard to peddle shabby, substandard merchandise. This is a huge waste of time and money; don't squander yours.",
    "148": "Visually, compositionally, Wes Anderson is without peer, and any individual shot out of his latest film will make practically every other movie released this year look like a provincial teenager's first TikTok video. Everywhere you look the details are never-endingly exquisite and hilarious, and my eyes haven't experienced so much pleasure since the last Wes Anderson flick. He's the only director left standing that I will still pay to go to a cinema to see.The downside is that the story itself is awkward, convoluted, flimsy and whimsical - flimsical, if you will - and it's often hard to follow or care about what is going on, especially in the larger story arc, which flits between a black & white 1950s TV production and the glorious technicolor of the main story. I would have been perfectly happy to have lost the needlessly distracting B&W sections, as they add very little in the long run, and sap the energy and pace of the rest. The clever story Anderson is trying to tell here could work, but he doesn't have a strong enough grip on all the narrative and character elements to convey it in a clear and emotionally engaging way, so there are parts that feel more of a private joke or a personal fancy than a work made for the wider world. It could be I'll think differently about that on further viewings, but I would expect it to still be the case that this is what weakens the film the most.The ridiculously stellar cast is dazzling, but there's just too many famous faces here for one film to do them justice: newcomer Tom Hanks is a great fit but woefully underused, and something similar could be said for Steve Carell, Tilda Swinton, Matt Dillon, Jeff Goldblum, Margot Robbie, Hope Davis, Bob Balaban and Willem Dafoe, all of whom are most welcome sights, but simply aren't onscreen long enough to convey anything of real substance, and they all deserved more fleshed-out roles they could get their teeth into.For the first time in a Wes Anderson movie there is some rather obvious diversity hiring in the casting department (presumably in order to meet the new qualifications for an Oscar), some of whom work better than others, but the returning Jeffrey Wright and Tony Revolori are both excellent, and Ethan Josh Lee is a good new addition to the family.Bryan Cranston and Edward Norton get more screen-time than most, but the first feels like a walk-on guest spot in a TV sketch show and the other looks somewhat lost in the confusing shuffle. Jason Schwartzman is, of course, the perfect Anderson avatar, and Scarlet Johansson is, for the most part, very dependable too. Liev Schreiber fits in surprisingly well, and the running gags with his son Aristou Meehan are perhaps the funniest high points of the film.-----All in all, it's hard to know how to rate this: it's definitely one of the weakest Wes Anderson movies, but for all the undeniable flaws in narrative it still gives me more joy to watch than just about anything else modern cinema has to offer, and I think it likely by December I'm still going to regard it the best thing I've seen all year. So that's odd.7.2/10.",
    "149": "It's happened. Wes may have pushed the boundary that it has snapped. Like all his films if you dont like his style, then just bypass because this will just rubber stamp it. As we follow a writer and his play about a grief striken father and his family descending upon a fictional city for a brainacs convention.The problem lays ostensibly with the script (i cant believe im saying that). Its so pretentious that it doesn't know if it's a comedy, drama or even science fiction. Granted there are moments that work and bring a genuine smile, but it's all too few. The cinematography is always a plus in an Anderson film, and that is true again here.Yes the cast is stellar but that doesn't mean it's going to work, hardly any of them get to actually challenge their range, with some just wasted. Scarlett Johansson probably to only genuine exception. This is a typical Wes Anderson story, its just he may have out Wes'd himself."
