    "0": "The best word to describe this movie was weird. I heard someone say it sounded like AI wrote it or something. And that is very true. I don't understand exactly what they were going for, it's like someone saw a movie before and decided to make one but really didn't have any idea what they were doing. Like an alien made it and was trying to blend in with the humans. Nobody was offensively bad or anything acting wise, so of the people in it I wondered what they were doing there as they were \"too\" famous for such a low production Hallmark channel type movie. Netflix is just shooting this stuff out and canceling good stuff, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I would not recommend this weird movie.",
    "1": "It's ironic that a movie with this title would get my lowest score ever! For a Christmas movie but that's exactly what this terrible, terrible movie deserves. We worry that artificial intelligence will ruin stories, but it seems as though this movie was written by clunky AI and directed by Monkey Bob (you'll know him if you watch the movie). So maybe it's a lesson for all of us that AI will never replace us. Or it's possible I'm projecting because no actual humans should have signed off on this stinker. The movie tried to be way too many things: is Santa real?; rich vs poor; can Brandy still sing? It's a big no for me.",
    "2": "Wow! Netflix really? The acting, the plot, it's like watching a car wreck. We can't be that desperate for Christmas movies surely. I had to watch till the end to see just how bad it was. These are some serious washed up actors that need to retire. I am struggling to use enough word count for this disaster of a movie. , obviously the actors thought the writing was atrocious. Look I took this on face value as a cheesy Christmas movie but seriously I can't understand why Netflix would play this garbage. Please, give it a miss. Actually watch any other Christmas movie ever made except this one. Seriously.",
    "3": "This is one of the worst movies I ever watched. The acting is horrible, the story line is horrible, Stay away from this one as its is a complete waste of time\nI cannot believe in this day of age that a movie can be this bad. There was no chemistry with any characters what so ever. I was really expecting something good with Jason Biggs but even his performance was lame. Im not sure I can complete this 600 charaters minimum as it doesn't take that many words to say that the movie sucked. 101 more charaters left to say avoid this movie at all costs it will be a waste of your time and life is too short.",
    "4": "This is certainly not as horrible as so many people are making it out to be. Like a lot have said, Christmas movies are supposed to be cheesy. The kids are cute. The story really isn't bad. It is cute. People are saying that it's confusing. There's nothing confusing about it. People are saying the plot is all over the place it really isn't. One thing I do agree on is the acting is a bit wooden they all could've done so much better. Who knows what the heck was going on during the filming you never know. As I said in my heading, I certainly won't watch this again, but it was cute enough. No big deal I'm not going to cry/& moan and groan about getting my time back. I've always had a crush on Heather Graham, And always liked Brandy, and I've always liked Jason Biggs, & the actor that played Brandy's characters husband I remember him from zombie nation. He was great in that , but they really all could've done better! Now., onto the new season of the Crown!!",
    "5": "I've endured many rushed Netflix movies over the past few years, but this one just takes the cake. The movies lacked any substance, had zero depth, and very lazy writing.This movie was overloaded with modern clich√®s. I respect Brandy, but her acting was just terrible. (Sorry Brandy). Jason Biggs was.. meh. The jokes never quite landed for me. They were understood, but too predictable and heard many times before. Nothing original.The product placement was junk food, which is quite fitting for what the film offered. I'd assume the only positive aspect of the film was that it was short. This means I didn't have to suffer for more than an hour and 20 minutes.",
    "6": "Was this written by people? Was it AI? Did it start being written before the writers strike but had a deadline and got chatgpt to write it?It just had no humanness to it. The plot is weird, the characters are weird, the script it weird.I kept watching because it took so many turns I had no idea where it was going, it could have gone in a lot of good directions, but the ending was like a sugar dream that came out of nowhere. All the Christmas fantasy tropes in the last 5 minutes with no context.I have no words to describe this film other than bizarre.Listen to the reviews. Don't waste your time.",
    "7": "Easily Netflix's most inexpensive film yet. You can tell just how many corners they cut in their edit to just give us a fluffy movie that tries to hard to be like Elf and falls flat on its face.The little boy in the film was the most entertaining part, because the acting from the adults just didn't cut it. You would think Biggs and Graham, who were the 90s names of teenage comedies, would have some sort of chemistry but they did not.Graham, who looks a lot like Michelle Pfeiffer and Madonna now, is reminiscent of Charlotte from Sex in the City here and perhaps Kristin Davis would have been a better choice to cast for her part. Norwood was okay, but as soon as she spoke, I just wanted Awkwafina for her part.This was about a 2.5 or 3 out of 5 until the last 20 minutes. The film just got overly cheesy and defied too much logic.",
    "8": "The plot got lost in the story after the first 15 minutes but it was a cute movie. There were funny moments and it was a good movie to watch whilst wrapping gifts.The children, their characters and their story arc, were annoying and barely fit in the story.It was messy, but so are the holidays. It's not the worst Christmas movie. I'm not a Brandy fan, but she was fine. She sang a few times. I liked the idea of old friends stuck together for the holidays.I won't put this on my list of \"must watch\" each year, but I didn't hate watching this. I gave it four stars. It was fine. I appreciate what they were trying to do.",
    "9": "I guess I'll start with the cast, zero chemistry. Even the actors couldn't act like they had any chemistry. It was uncomfortable to watch. I mean, I don't know if they got along in real life but I could swear I saw Heather Graham with cringe face when having to do a hug scene with Brandy. These aren't the best actors around but I don't think I've ever seen them this bad. It was like torture to watch. The kids were cute. I'm never going to bash children. All children are cute! The backstories for the characters were boring and without emotion. Don't want to give anything away and ruin it for anyone. As if that's possible. It's pretty much ruined from the opening scene. I think the writers strike started with this film. The Best think about The Best Christmas Ever Movie was THE END! Don't waste your time.",
    "10": "This movie sucks\nI've had to watch it with my family (no escape) but I had the worst time. You know it's bad when the kid actors are better actors than the main lead. The kids have a few funny lines and are the only good parts about the movie, because they're not insufferable. The main chick and the other adults have an awful dynamic with each other and they're not funny. The main character can't even deliver good dialogue or even act good, she just makes odd faces and poorly delivers lines. You can just tell she doesn't want to be there. And, they're all such uninteresting characters and it's terribly cringy and boring.",
    "11": "Watching this film was like enduring a cinematic nightmare. The plot was a convoluted mess, stumbling through a labyrinth of confusion. The acting was wooden, as if the cast had mistaken emotion for a distant concept. Special effects were laughable, resembling a high school project gone wrong. Dialogue? More like a painful assault on language. The soundtrack was a cacophony of discordant noise, assaulting eardrums with every note. Even the cinematography seemed determined to induce migraines, with its nauseating camera work. Save yourself and skip this cinematic catastrophe - an agonizing experience that makes you question the very nature of filmmaking.",
    "12": "I'm sorry to put down a Christmas movie, but the acting and directing was almost 'laugh out loud' bad.The story is quite cute, but the directing, script and acting just don't bring the best out of it at all. I was quite shocked by it really.The actors don't display any authenticity, so it's hard to connect to them or empathise with them. Maybe they were struggling with a poor script and poor direction, because they have acted better in their other films. The plot being a bit too far fetched at times doesn't help either.Shame on you Netflix for releasing this while jacking up our subscription costs by multiples of the inflation rate!",
    "13": "Desperate attempt to write and produce a Christmas movie during the industry strikes. If I had to guess, the assignment was to make the worst Christmas movie of all time. But it's actually the worst movie I've ever seen.And who lies about their son dying? If they are actually friends, wouldn't they know about a child's death or go to the funeral? Or donate to the memorial fund? It's completely ridiculous and borderline offensive.Do not waste your time!!! Netflix should be ashamed of themselves. My family didn't even finish it with me - they thought I was pranking them. Started as a movie that wasn't funny, took a corny turn, then crashed into a dumpster fire. It kept getting worse.",
    "14": "I tried to watch the movie for a few minutes.Chat gpt could do a much better job.Brand and Heather couldn't save how bad this movie is. No wonder it was shelved for years. Too bad elf on the shelf couldnt kick it into the fireplace.Sinc ei have 600 words i need to fulfill here, let me tell you about one of the writers:LRL one of the writers of this movie is a total creep.I have all the receipts.This person is the opposite of a moral and Honorable guy. This person should be writing immoral life tips on reddit, not cozy xmas movies.I know from 2ND degree personal experience he managed to ruin lives with his trash antics.Again, I have all the receipts and am happy to make tiktoks about it all if he wants to protest my post.",
    "15": "I'd like to mention one decent thing about this film but unfortunately, i can't. Everything about this movie was terrible. The acting, the story, the directing, the continuity. Everything was awful. Nothing makes any sense. The amount of crying is ridiculous and it looks like the so called \"tears\" have been applied to the actors face, probably because the lack of all emotion was completely missing. The CGI was also particularly bad, something you'd expect from a high school kid that's \"done his best\".How and why Netflix commission this level of movie amazes me.This is absolutely atrocious. Don't waste your time.",
    "16": "Wow. This movie started out ok and I actually laughed at the intended comedy. I love Brandy and Heather and I thought they were good together in the movie.But then, whoa. This movie went off the rails and I couldn't stop laughing. I had tears rolling down my eyes because every time I thought of something illogical this movie did, it would spur another even more hilarious questionExamples -The hot air balloon. I will watch a whole movie on this contraption.Uh wind doesn't work the way you think it does! Why is there a fan on the back end?How is it a \"hot air\" balloon with no hot air?How is it solar powered?Is there a battery?Where is the fan to blow wind into the balloon?Why do they only fly it at night????? When the sun isn't out??????? There's no battery.....How is Brandy maneuvering it in the sky??How does it know where to go?I need a documentary made about the tech behind this hot air balloon immediately!",
    "17": "Pinche Netflix you got me good on this one. The plot is caca. I still do not understand why I actually watched the whole thing. I guess i so bad that you keep on watching waiting on something to happen. And it kinda does, but holly cow, I'm still trying to figure out what in the world I watched. Starts decently, I digged the set up of the story and the characters but, really? And truste me, Im a very easy customer when it comes to consuming entertainment, but this movie is ridiculous. Please Netflix: I need back my hour and twenty minutes I spent watching this movie, plus the time i spent looking for something to watch.",
    "18": "Super cringe from the start.I felt they switched the genre of the movie, through out the movie.Is it a comedy, a drama, a kids movie? They had the key players, great props and Christmas spirit but had a horrible story line.I watched this as some background white noise while I made dinner and that's all this movie is good for. That movie with Lindsey Lohan was better than this one. They need to spend more money on better writing.I would suggest for Netflix to do some research on what people really want to see rather then spending all this money on a grotesque, want to be Hallmark Christmas movie.",
    "19": "Best. Christmas. Ever! Was a decent movie that had a lot of potential but unfortunately that's all it had. The movie itself had a storyline that I could get behind of and a twist towards the end but the acting and the fact the movie was so rushed ruined the film for me.The movie was rushed after the first 15 minutes, with poor cut scenes and awful editing. It's like the studio had a se date on its release and couldn't budge it a day so they could finish the movie. I hated that scenes would just cut off the emotions to get to the next informational part. In high school they taught how to story board, they got that part down, but are missing the story itself and how to tell it.I love Christmas movies but this one stretched my hope for it. The thing that saved this movie was the twist ending and the appearance of the real Santa.My Favorite Part: The appearance of the real Santa was awesome even though I wish it was longer with more dialogue.",
    "20": "This is the weirdest Christmas movie I've seen in a long time. I 100% do not believe a human being wrote that script. The plot and the way everyone speaks is not how any human would act or speak. I wouldn't even be surprised if the actors themselves are digitally added in like in that Black Mirror episode because there mouths look strange as they're speaking I thought Netflix was glitching at first and the sound was off but nothing I did fixed it and I tried it on a different TV and it was the same which means that's just how the movie looks. Totally bonkers movie and an absolute waste of time!",
    "21": "I really wanted to like this one because I love Brandy and thought the kids were adorable. It starts out pretty enjoyable with good introduction of characters, but then goes downhill from there.The story is all over the place... way too many plot lines that don't make sense together. I wasn't sure what this movie was trying to achieve, unfortunately.I do need to touch on a couple spoilers that just irked me. Upon driving to the main character's sister's home for Christmas, they discovered after the fact that it wasn't actually the right home... like how do you not know what you're sister's new house looks like? Wouldn't you check the address prior to leaving, especially if you've never seen the home? So weird.Then there's the whole \"is Santa real thing\" and one of the kids trying to figure out if she has superpowers; they just don't fit within the movie.While I was really hoping this to turn itself around with the storylines falling together, I was disappointed. The very end (like the last two minutes) tried to do just that and it fell flat.In all honesty, I'd skip this one (& I rarely say this about Christmas movies; they're my fave genre!)",
    "22": "A whole lot of grinches reviewing this movie...yeeesh....it's supposed to be a cheesy Xmas movie with actors that bring us back to our youth. Not some Scorsese film. It was cute and relatable, especially with the basis of those Braggy holiday letters everyone used to recieve every year (Heather Graham did my mother justice reading those letters every year) if you want something easy as background noise during the holidays while baking or cooking thats also family friendly, pop it on. It's a pleasant film and I loved seeing Brandy acting in a role in a movie after all these years....p.s. I thought the acting was fun and not atrocious....what do people expect when the headliner is \"from the makers of the Princess Switch\"",
    "23": "We could only tolerate an hour! After 30 minutes our 10 year old daughter was complaining it was boring and questioned if this was comedy. We told her to give it chance but after an hour we all agreed this was the worst movie we had watched in a long time. We kept thinking it will get funny in a minute but the joke was on us. We're not film snobs, Our family has watched so many Christmas movies I've lost track. Many of the good ones get watched over and over every year. We couldn't even get to the end of this one. Don't bother watching this, there are so many better Christmas films out there, or just watch home alone for the 100th time.",
    "24": "I also wish I could delete it from my brain. The acting by most was okay but Heather Graham, sweetheart, take lessons! She was deadpan, emotionless and bland even after her character's journey found a more fruitful path. She made this movie sooo much cringe for me. Someone said it's a Hallmark movie with better acting and I laughed so loud I woke up my boyfriend because that's a better joke than most of the \"comedy\" in this film. I thought the movie with Lindsey Lohan trying to make facial expressions through all of her plastic surgery was bad, but I kept watching this just hoping it would get better and I guess I'm the sucker now. I have never left a review on IMDb but I felt it was the right thing to do this year to help others steer clear and use that time for really, anything else. In fact, I immediately texted my Mom and told her she may want to avoid it. I'm so sorry but whoever is doing casting for these Netflix movies, please consider fresh, new talent that can act with their whole face, you will probably save some money in the process. I can't relate to actresses with taut, expressionless faces. It's really destroying my immersion. I thought I could rely on you for quality, Netflix, please get it together. Thanks!",
    "25": "Look we all new what we were getting when we seen the trailer. Yes this feels like a Hallmark movie but with better acting . I liked the characters and story. Some scenes were actually funny. The movie is funny at times but could've been funnier. With a eighty minute runtime it felt all crammed together. This shouldi been 30 minutes longer. My favorite scene involved tree sap and a hand. Jason Biggs and heather graham were a odd pairing but it worked. It was cheesy and predictable just like a Hallmark movie. I did enjoy the ending but again cheesy. I do however recommend the movie. It's fine for a one time watch.Timothy Treakle.",
    "26": "SPOILER ALERT!The women in my house were not impressed.The husband is a wimp who hides his Christmas letters to friends and family from his wife for years. After unexpectedly showing up at his ex-girlfriend's house in a blizzard under questionable circumstances they have to stay. The husband is touchy feely with his ex-girlfriend acting like the wife has a problem. She sees her husband's letter come in the mail but was unable to open it and see what was in the letter. She asks her husband if he still communicates with Jackie, he says no and gas lights her through out the rest of the movie. She plays the typical self-defeating woman apologizing for everything.It's like they took the Save the Cat! Guide on writing a story structure then filled it in the extra space with random BS.",
    "27": "I'm a sucker for a good sappy Christmas movie and I can forgive a lot of bad acting for a cheesy holiday plot and some good old fashioned romance. This movie fulfilled NONE of my expectations and the acting was worse than those mushy Hallmark movies.To start off, the two married couples spend the first half of the movie lusting after each other's spouses (very strange and not at all authentic). This never gets unpacked or apologized for, just glossed over. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop with Brandy's character and make her more likeable. Yes there was a bit of a sad backstory but even that does not erase the supposed perfection of her life.All of it was about attaining wealth as the main point of life, and all it tried to say was that if you try hard enough you can be anything you want to be. But you still get the feeling that Charlotte feels inferior even though she tries to like her life situation. It by no means brings authenticity, depth, gratitude or appreciation, all of which are much more important than wealth and accomplishment. Of course it did not touch the real meaning of Christmas or even get slightly close to it. It kind of mimics the elements of a bunch of Christmas movies and cobbles them all together into a bland, strange, stinky cheese kind of movie.It was barely funny, eliciting nary a smile. It was barely sad, not being invested or attached to any of the characters. It was barely romance, with no believability of the attraction for their own spouses. It was not made for kids (not funny or good), nor adults (not deep, not clever, no real message, too cliche).The main reason I wasted an hour and a half is I had to see where it was going and how it was going to remedy these situations. In the end it was just a waste of time. Watch anything else instead.",
    "28": "I don't think any one expected quality acting from Brandy or Jason Biggs, but Heather Graham ... sigh. Netflix Christmas movies aren't really known for well-thought out plots, sensical writing, or production value and Best. Christmas. Ever! Certainly doesn't elevate the genre. What's sad, is that the premise and overall arc could have been a truly meaningful movie if not for the extreme silliness and daytimeTV level directing. At least the movie is self-aware enough to end itself leaving most of the major \"plot\" elements either forgotten or carried away by a solar-powered, cold fusion reactor equipped hot air balloon.",
    "29": "I am sorry but I love campy, gushy Christmas movies with an edge. I love a combination of realities that people might find somewhat unrealistic and I get allof bc if that with the warm and fuzzies this movie brings. It's so unrealistic but cute that it wins! I love this movie and will predict its timeless appeal for years to come. I hope this movie makes it to Netflix's top 10 this week and stays there through Christmas. The only thing I hate is that Brandy's Christmas album had a place in this movie that essentially must have not made production times or guidelines. Yet, I am glad this movie came out! It got me in the holiday.",
    "30": "Oh my god this movie was not at all good. Not to say that i was expecting much because it was a netflix Christmas movie but it was still really bad. First off what was with the incredible amount of really bad sex jokes, like come on, its a kids Christmas movie. That one really smart child was a different type of annoying. I'm pretty sure she was intended to be funny but honestly she was just really insufferable. The dialogue itself was really poorly written and the delivery was even worse, partially because every single preformance was extremely wooden. The story itself wasn't that strong and was kinda predictable. Would NOT recommend. 3.6/10.",
    "31": "I'll admit the beginning of this movie is cheesy with all of the cliches that you expect from corny Christmas movies. The first half presents that way but slowly delves deeper into the idea friendships and you may not know what people are going through behind closed doors. I won't use any spoilers to talk about the last act of the story but there is heart and human connection. I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would and I'm glad I stuck it out. Great fun movie about Christmas, friends, family, love and appreciating the blessings and people we have in our lives. Always loved Brandy and Heather Graham, they're cute in here as friends!!",
    "32": "I'd love to know how bad the actors were who Brandy actually beat out during auditions because her acting would be bad for. Nickelodeon standards. Delivery with same weird smile no matter the emotion needed in the scene. Secondly why is there so much hugging in every scene. I dare you to take a drink every time someone freaking hugs in this movie. So much hugging and seems like the only way the director knew how to end a scene. The story is just poorly written and overall just a train wreck. Random singing, hot air balloons, I kid you not. I'm sure the actors agents are in damage control mode. They should be.",
    "33": "This movie is beyond cheesy. I can appreciate some cheese around the holidays but this is just next level BAD!!! If I'd paid for it I'd want my money back.It does have some actors that are memorable from some older movies which I appreciated but I'm kind of embarrassed for them. Surely they didn't realize how awful the film would actually be before signing on!We hung on until the end but sadly it got worse instead of better. I'm only still writing about my disappointment because this site requires 600+ characters to post a review and I really want to warn others! Please don't waste your time and also, don't add fuel to the fire or whoever made this by giving them a Netflix \"view\". We don't need anything else like this to be made ever ever again!",
    "34": "Let me say that I found the movie watchable. It was not a bad movie. It was your typical cheesy Holiday movie in my opinion. I don't understand all the low ratings. If you like B movies then this movie should be something you can watch. I saw someone wrote about the storyline being all over the place; but I don't feel it was. Even though the acting was mediocre , the cast was believable. I've seen way worse acting than what I witnessed watching this. I found the movie cute. Would I watch it again? No but it was good for what I needed. I wanted a feel good movie and it didn't disappoint me. I don't think it deserves a 1 star. 6 at best.",
    "35": "What a good wife you would be. But an actress? Nope. But Brandy's lack of any discernable acting skill is the least of the problems with this soulless steaming pile of bah humbug.The writing is dull and lifeless and the special effects are clumsy and dated.And watching Roller Girl make out with the dweeb from American Pie is just stomach turning.On a positive note, the children are cute and Brandy adds some delightful music.It's sad that Netflix spends so much on casting actors, and apparently has been rummaging through the dumpster behind Hallmark for scripts.Now I have to fill space to reach minimum characters.",
    "36": "This movie is set up like a movie to watch with your kids but it has some really inappropriate scenes and jokes revolving around sex that are just cringy. What is confusing is the movie is too silly to be taken seriously by adults but sex jokes that are too uncomfortable for kids ( even if it goes over their heads) who is the target audience here? No chemistry between Biggs and Graham. It's truly a shame because the plot points with the son and is Santa real or not would have made the movie a great Christmas classic for the entire family to enjoy but they had to mess it up with all the sexual innuendos SMH.",
    "37": "I found the plot of the movie to be all over the place. You had many different plot lines with the Sanders family, the Jennings family, along with their kids, which did not blend together that well. For example, you had Charlotte Sanders trying to figure out what Jackie Jennings is hiding because there is no way she has a nice house and travels with her family while at the same time, Jackie's daughter Beatrix and Charlotte's kids are trying to figure out if Santa is real. There was also a weird plotline between Rob Sanders and Jackie. With that said, I do appreciate the diversity in the movie, especially with the main cast, and Brandy has a nice singing voice.",
    "38": "I use IMDB a lot to see how people rate movies and to read the reviews. Most of the time it is accurate, but not this time. Best Christmas Ever is a funny, sweet movie and definitely worth watching. I watched it with my family and everyone enjoyed it. There were many laugh out load moments and it is a sweet story with a good message. You never really know what is happening in someone's life and we all need to give each other the benefit of the doubt. Please ignore all the bad reviews and watch this movie, I promise you will enjoy it, even the cheesy parts!! I hope everyone has a wonderful holidays and a happy new year!",
    "39": "I rarely rewatch movies but I just watched this one for the second time! It's such a feel good movie without the unnecessary hectic Drama but still instills an important message: We can't control what happens but we can control how we handle it. That was such an important lesson.Jackie's energy is still such a treat especially when you watch the movie for the second time. After the \"twist\" is revealed. She chooses her words so precisely that she never lies but still doesn't tell more than she wants. A queen. It doesn't compare to classics like the grinch, Santa claus or even newer homeruns like Christmas chronicles but it's definetly really good! I had and awful morning, now I don't!",
    "40": "It was time for the first christmas movie this year and the kids were allowed to choose. Hm, it wasn't the best choice.I don't understand how you still can make a story about jealousy of another persons life? We all know, that everybody has a sad song. Or am I just too old for this?Everything is predictable. The characters are what I as a European would describe as the stereotype American - nice on the surface, but bitter and mean underneath. (I know that Americans are not this way - it's the stereotype that is shown in shows an movies).What also wonders me: Who the hell has the opportunity to welcome suprise guest for Christmas - people, they have not seen for a 100 years and bearly know anymore? I find that Christmas is about family. And I also see that especially the time before Christmas is a time of a lot to dos. I find it unrealistic to show, that you have the time for all kind of extra activities with your guests.I know, it's just a movie, but since you try to be close to reality in certain aspects, you can't just draw a complete fantasy situation in others.I love Christmas movies - and they are allowed to be cheesy and don't need to be realistic or a work of art. There are Christmas movies out there that one could be inspired by and then produce something, that i smore pleasant to watch.",
    "41": "I've watched a lot of Christmas movies, and this one is actually pretty good! I genuinely don't get all the hate it's getting. I've been binging Hallmark style Christmas movies recently and the acting and storyline is always pretty weak and a bit cringy. But this was so much better than I was expecting. The acting was pretty solid with good performances and the story was fun. The only thing I could have done without was Brandy's singing as it felt forced and she didn't sound great. I hope people give it a chance and don't take it too seriously. It's Christmas people!!! A solid 7/10 effort and I hope there's a sequel.",
    "42": "So many bad reviews, but I think they miss the point. Christmas movies are SUPPOSED to be cheesy. And this one is. But it is cheesy in a creative, splendiferous way. You can't help but think of Hallmark movies when you watch it. But this was a Hallmark type movie with a little more depth and creativity.Is the acting the best I've ever seen? No. But it is also nowhere near the worst. I thought Brandi did a good job in most scenes. There were a couple of times it wasn't great, but I thought she made up for it in other scenes.We probably all have that family we think is \"too perfect.\" I thought it was a great idea to play that up - even if it was far-fetched. Again, that's what Christmas movies SHOULD be. I loved it. And I will watch it again next year.",
    "43": "This movie.... It was just bad. I felt like Heather Graham was a better actress than this. Her character was terrible. There was no back story, no explanation of anything. It started off with Heather Graham talking to the viewer, which I thought was great, but it fell very flat. The only two that didn't over act was Jason Biggs and Matt Cedeno. I genuinely thought it was going to be a \"Surprise! We are Santa and Mrs. Claus\" type movie, which would have been a better plot. But it wasn't. It was \"Oh yeah my life is really this great, even though I don't really explain how I got my money or success.\"However, I did end up crying a little bit, after finding out that the Jennings oldest died, which came out of absolutely no where. And it was so glossed over. Even their daughter, Beatrix, didn't mention anything about her brother.It felt rushed, it was one mishap after the other, and it just left you feeling like \"That's it? That's the whole movie? I wasted about an hour and a half of my day.\"",
    "44": "This is a really cute, sometimes clever, and very enjoyable holiday movie. I mean, if you can't sit and enjoy something like this, you are a Scrooge!Is it silly at times? Absolutely! But it's also quite touching and poignant and will get you into the holiday spirit. Any movie that has Monkey Bob has to be worth way more than its current rating. My wife watches so many Hallmark Christmas movies and I have seen a few. They're all very similar and the plots are quite thin. If that's your jam, you should enjoy this too. It's different from the Hallmark stuff, but it has some great wintery scenery and a house that I would LOVE to celebrate Christmas in!",
    "45": "As others have stated, this film has so many flaws. I stuck it out just to see if there were any redeeming qualities to be had. The answer, well, I thought some of the decorations, and the landscape shots were very nice to look at, and I think Brandy has a great screen presence. She is quite vivacious, and so beautiful, still. Hard to believe she is 44. Glad they utilized her beautiful singing voice a little bit. Other than that, there just wasn't much substance to this film. I certainly would not recommend it. Unfortunately, many of these holiday type films tend to be a bit sappy.There is one that stands out for me, at least. It is called \"Heaven Sent\".The ending is unlike any other holiday film I have ever seen. Well worth the watch.",
    "46": "RnB superstar Brandy joins American Pie's Jason Biggs and Heather Graham from The Hangover part 2 in this lackluster festive comedy.The plot follows Jackie(Brandy)who sends a boastful holiday newsletter every single Christmas that makes her old college friend Charlotte(Graham) jealous.Things take a turn when Charlotte, her husband Rob(Biggs), and their family meet Jackie and her husband Valentino at her house. Charlotte is determined to find out that her old friend's \"perfect\" life isn't all good.Can the two friends reconcile?. Overall this wasnt great. The story was somewhat not coherent ,the acting was just not great even poor Brandy(who I have been a fan of since the 90s )tried her best with this film. Heather Graham is a terrible actress. I don't know what it is about her but she's just not a likeable person she's just too boring.If your a fan of Brandy's go watch Cinderella 1997 instead or if your a fan of Jason Biggs go watch Eight Below instead.",
    "47": "Five minutes in, we figured it had to get better. 40 minutes in we discussed whether or not it was worth continuing. The answer, in\nretrospect, definitely not!There is absolutely no chemistry between the actors. There are no funny moments. The plot is thinner than the emperors new clothes. The snow keeps appearing and disappearing and appearing again, so the continuity is also lacking.And the worst part? They have nooooooo fact checking. Whether it was books, science or economics.There is no balloon in the book by Jules Verne.Just don't. It's not worth your time. At all. Just don't watch it.",
    "48": "Reading these reviews they act like it was real life and it was comedy fantasy movie. I liked it was cute. Not overly kid movie adult parts. Brandy can act and sing remember she was a child actress Moesha. She had her first platinum album at 14 years old. So she can't do no wrong. All the characters fit in this movie. The diversity was great. White, Mexican and Black. Yes to diversity in a movie. It is a Christmas movie not The 10 Commandments. I watched it a few times and still laugh. The whole concept of he story is get out of your own way. And you can have what Charlotte had and she did at the end.",
    "49": "I know this premise has been done to many times. People have nothing in common, are forced to spend time together for the holidays. Watching this film I couldn't help feel there was a funnier heartwarming film just wanting to come out but never does.Heather Graham and Jason Biggs. Don't get me wrong are very talented, but them playing a couple wasn't convincing, they just did not click, there scenes together just came across has too awkward. Now Heather Graham and Brandy Norwoood had better chemistry, but not enough to make the story interesting. The actor playing Brandys husband does ok for what he is giving, but that is it. So do the kid actors. And the jokes don't quite hit either.",
    "50": "I agree with some of the positive reviews that mention that Christmas movies are supposed to be cheesy and predictable and I also think there's enough good for kids to enjoy and for adults to like parts of this story.I predicted one sad part but won't spoil it here except to say I think there was a positive message in the movie that no matter how good or bad we think our lives are compared to others, we all have goodness in our lives.Someone in a relationship might be grateful even if life doesn't always turn out how we planned and we can still celebrate family and friends.People are more important than objects too.I liked the decorations and like each of the main cast.Brandy looked and sounded beautifully.I would have rated this more highly if one part was a bit more believable but I would watch this again for the themes of family and friendship.",
    "51": "I think there is a lot wrong with this movie. It felt hallmark esq but not in a good way. One point is brandy. She can still sing but I don't know about the acting. I think the characters were just not scripted well and it made them not feel believable. Graham and bigs kinda felt out of place as a couple and I don't think the chemistry flew.the child characters were over acted and annoying. I suppose it's a nice film to watch with the family as something to put on. Brandy is Graham's best friend and her son uses the phone to swap the GPS to her house and not the aunts to get them back to get her. The plot is not great but there were some moments of heart within this and if written better this movie really could've been higher.",
    "52": "This movie is a gem. Everyone on here is missing the point of this movie. Funny, Corny, Spiritual. Just sit back and enjoy it!!!! Brandy kills it as her character Jackie. Heather puts a comedic relief to the film. All and All just enjoy the movie!!! Merry Christmas!!!!! Sometimes critics and fans need to realize this clearly isn't going to win an Oscar. This movie is so much fun. I wish Jason Biggs did bring more of his American Pie humor, but after all this is a Netflix Christmas movie. Love that it really just has fun with different crowds. Literally Best Christmas Ever. Wish Brandy put these songs on her album.",
    "53": "Utterly utterly horrendous movie. There are honestly zero positives about this film. Other than in the end it finally finishes! The acting is terrible, the plot terrible, it's just all awful. It's not even one of those movies that you watch and think \"awww it was bad, but cute and I still enjoyed it!\" No, no, it has no redeeming features at all. There are so many parts that are beyond weird and it's filled out with yawnworthy nothingness. The actual ending is one of the weirdest things you might witness. I'd say watch it just for that. But even that was terrrrrible! If I could give this zero I would. Worst movie I've ever seen and should never have made it past the cutting room floor. They just should have binned it!Just don't bother! Even if you love cheesy Christmas films like me. Do NOT bother!What were you thinking spending money on this tripe Netflix!",
    "54": "I've seen nearly every hallmark Christmas movie there is. Many of which, multiple times. Probably 8 a week during the season. So with that said... this is... bad!Honestly a lot of the beginning gave me hope but the end just I can't get over it. The cast is great. It should be better. The script just... gave up. There are so many things that just don't make sense at all and even in suspending all sense of reality, gos don't even look halfway believable.Please don't watch it. It's not worth your time. The only good parts are knowing Brandy still has a great voice and somehow heather graham gets more beautiful.That's it. You're done. Move on.",
    "55": "The plot holes are so big you can shove the hot air balloon from the end through. The only good thing about this movie was that it ended and there's no logical way for anyone to make a sequel. But I'm sure the blind rat on shrooms that danced on the keyboard long enough to write this piece of garbage will find a way if Netflix pays it enough. Poor Jason Biggs, he had the only likable character. Where did all the snow go!? How many laws of physics did that hot air balloon and sleigh scene break? Brandy's mad her office was rummaged though and her attic was entered, but her dead son's locked room gets entered without permission and it's ok? And what a weak plot device her son's death was, it was like an aside. Just a trash movie. I expected more from Heather Graham. At least in Boogie Nights getting screwed was in the script, not because of it. And the kids were unlikable from the moment you met them. Brandy and her husband? Pretty sure they're the type of people to give out floss on Halloween. And if you think that's a harsh review, my wife said I sugar coated it!",
    "56": "The best way I can describe this movie is a cheese factory due to the lack of creative ideas, cheesy and bland writing along with acting that even my 7 year old cousin be better at. So the writing or lack of, the whole movie feels like the writers were high and drunk and somehow it got turned into a movie it's like all creative ideas were thrown out and replaced with bland cliches predictable story lines cheesy lines bad jokes and too many plots. And when i was watching this I thought that the acting could salvage this dumpster fire but no the acting was somehow forced and lifeless at the same time, like the actors are just barely trying just doing it for a paycheck. The actors have done better before so the lack of care is shocking. So that's why I give it a 4/10.",
    "57": "I would like to disagree with all the bad reviews of this film. I would like to say this film has heart and an important message for society. I would like to say that this film should become the template for all other Christmas films to follow. I would like to say that the myriad Christmas films in my vast collection have now faded into obscurity.I would like to say all of those things but my god that is a trillion miles from the truth. \"Best Christmas Ever\" is inconceivably awful. It is not the \"Worst Film Ever\", but it is knocking on the door of that accolade.I speak with authority on this because we did watch the whole film but we really don't know why.The opening premise was fine, the jealousy brought about by receiving an over the top Family Round Robin newsletter from an estranged friend. Then the kid mischievously entering the said friend's address in the satnav, instead of the correct destination sets up a nice platform for the rest of the film. After that the script and direction were handed over to people who should chose a different profession.",
    "58": "I love Christmas movie so my wife convinced me to watch this gem that for some reason quickly left the number 1 spot. Now I know Christmas movies are corny and silly , so I didn't expect a cinematic masterpiece. This movie started ok but then the plot went all over the place. It was either written by chat GPT , three headed broadway star ( whose line is it anyways) monkey Bob. Wrong GPS fine but didn't they realise they going the wrong way? Snowed in , next day gone why did they stay ? The Jennings family are a bunch of super achievers according to plot but it was literally not needed. Beatrix is rude and annoying. ( I blame the script and not the child) Once can be super smart and still have a sense of humility. The chess scene. Charlotte gave Beatrix a chess and she cheated using an illegal and impossible move to checkmate here. If she is so smart why she did that. Charlotte snooping around was annoying. Jackie was pure evil locking Charlotte on the balcony in the middle of a snowstorm.( I knew you were snooping in the room). The children taking Santa's wig off was funny. Boy runs away\nBecause he is dumb and plot. It just added to the runtime and was probably a filler scene. Charlotte breaking doll house another filler scene. It took months to build - Jackie. Rob , Charlotte and some magical elves fix it in one night. Charlotte signs a loan another filler scene. I told my wife she is going drive off the road and 20 seconds later. The Angel taking the long walk in the snow in costume because plot! I would have given this movie a 1 but the reason for the 2 is the solar powered Balloon. I balled of laughing because this is beyond stupid. Even 1980's spoof movies weren't this silly. Charlotte risked her life to jump into the sleigh because stupidity. Monkey Bob conveniently falls into Boy's hands. Who cares about wind and physics. Plot was all over the place with a lot of dead ends. Plot made no sense. Thank goodness this movie is 80 minutes because it ran out of movie at the 30 minute mark. Acting was so bad. Luckily the best actor Monkey Bob and the stupid balloon ride saved it from being a 1. I realised today it was a comedy. Except for the balloon scene which is hilariously stupid , no comedy found.",
    "59": "I was surprised when I saw so many low reviews. I'm curious how many of them watch Hallmark Christmas movies. Comparatively I thought this was an easy going sweet holiday movie. Sure it has plot holes, story arcs that make no sense, and cheesey acting. But this isn't a movie that takes itself too seriously. Overnight unexpected blizzards, heated driveways, hot air balloons, outdoor pageants, spontaneous songs. The story of a mom who has lost herself in the process of caring for her family and sacrificing her own dreams, who realizes how blessed she is and rekindles passion with her husband was surprisingly heavy for such a lighthearted movie, but it took a sweet turn.",
    "60": "I used to like Brandy but wow this is totally different person the acting across the board is bad and the writing! Netflix actually has nothing decent coming out any more. Once a year maybe a decent new show then the rest is so bad. I have around 5 subscriptions and this is my most expensive. No decent Christmas films at all. Time to get rid.None of this film makes sense the ending is terrible it's not even on the same level as a bad predictable hallmark mark film. They may all be the same but atleast they are watchable. Don't let the line up fool you they've all forgotten how to act and just desperately trying to still be actors. Avoid.",
    "61": "I'm consistently lazy about writing IMDb reviews, but this movie was truly, truly awful, and now I just need to vent. The plot felt nonsensical, as if stitched from disparate storylines. The lead character's intrusive behavior felt rude and irritating-who just breaks into strangers' homes locked rooms and breaks stuff? And somehow, it's deemed 'okay'? The lady was too forgiving.It's unbelievable that Netflix axes good shows for this; whatever gets them money, I guess. It's always a glaring 'hit or miss' with them, and this was a monumental miss. Spare yourself; don't waste your evenings. Opt for classic Christmas movies instead.",
    "62": "Two old college friends are trapped in a twisted game of envy and deception. Jackie (played by Brandy Norwood) is a ruthless and manipulative woman who writes a yearly newsletter to taunt her friends with her achievements and happiness. Charlotte (played by Heather Graham) is a desperate and unhappy woman who feels tormented and inferior by Jackie's perfect life. When Charlotte accidentally ends up at Jackie's house on Christmas Eve, she decides to stay and expose Jackie's life as a lie. However, as they spend time together, they discover that they have more secrets than they thought. What does charlottes husband have to hide and can he manipulate her through shaming her for her anxieties and own self doubt enough to get what he wants?The movie has so many unexpected twists and turns I was genuinely up all night afterwards still trying to figure out the implications of what I had just witnessed.Like how did that bearded man disappear?And the dollhouse.... If youve seen hereditary you'll know what I mean.I don't want to spoil anything.How they managed to convince the censors to only give it a pg rating is a mystery to me.Best Christmas ever is a brilliant take on the evengelical Christian belief of positive thoughts creating wealth and prosperity.. if you have faith like Brandy.Bless us everyone.",
    "63": "I loved this movie! Brandy, Heather, Jason, Matt and the kids - great cast. It was a funny, feel good, Christmas movie. I love that Brandy sang in the movie. It has replay value. I'm glad it's #1 on Netflix. I honestly can see this movie becoming a series or the start of additional \"installments.\" I would watch Best. Halloween. Ever! Best. Thanksgiving. Ever! Best. Valentine's Day. Ever! Best. - Well, you get the point! Lol. The characters are fun and the story doesn't take itself too seriously. I loved the chemistry between the actors. I want to see more of them. I have not enjoyed a Christmas movie like this in a while.",
    "64": "I enjoyed \"Best Christmas Ever!\" more than I thought I would. The movie is centered around the friendship of Brandy and Heathers characters. I love how we got to see the two characters come together after many years, let out some built up frustration and see the ups and downs of their complicated friendship. I also love the sentimental moments this movie offered just as much as the comedic relief. Brandy and Heather's on screen chemistry was great. It was good seeing these two amazing actors together. The child actors did really good as well. I can see this movie being a sequel the way the two families united at the end. Maybe the two families go on a vacation/road trip for the second installment. That could be really interesting. All in all I thought the movie was great and I will definitely be rewatching. Watch with the family if you get a chance, it's a fun watch.",
    "65": "This was a clunky one. Underdeveloped characters, choppy scenes, and less-than-great acting all combine to make this a one-off viewing. This is great for families that want a safe-for-kids option, but it does take a dark (yet predictable) turn.I expected more from seasoned actors like Biggs and Graham. Although even good actors can suffer from bad writing, they still could've given more emotion and believability to their lines.The title of the film could've used some more time in the think tank. I might've gone with \"Christmas With Jackie\"Also kind of confused why they felt the Sanders family needed a daughter. She was absent for most of the movie.",
    "66": "This movie should not be rated PG!! Lots of sex references between the adults. Lots of French kissing between the adults and there is one scene where one of the couples is laying in bed, and there bed is rocking back and forth because the other couple is obviously having sex in the room next door and it's causing their bed to shake, then at breakfast the next morning the kids ask about the noises and the blaming it on moving furniture. It's really cringey and was uncomfortable to watch with my young 10 year old son. He kept covering his eyes and said this movie is inappropriate for children and shouldn't be rated PG!",
    "67": "It was a pretty cheesy movies where her son (socially awkward and has a stuffed monkey for a best friend) put in a \"wrong address\" and the family ends up showing up at the husbands ex who sends Christmas letters that seem too good to be true.After staying the night and planning to leave for the sisters in the morning the snow comes and they are stuck. She makes the best of it but is super suspicious of this overly friendly perfect women (brandy) and they go on some adventures. Yes it's almost too good to be true at times, but it's a cheese Christmas movie! It was moving and cute! Check it out.",
    "68": "With all he Christmas movies available today, you would be better spent watching anything other than this movie. The Holiday Switch was way better and even it wasn't that good.This movie is simply an attempt to give Brandy some credibility within the film industry once again.There was not a single plot line that was followed through on with any forethought. The best part was Bob. The music was underwhelming. I definitely thing the title was extremely misleading. This movie started out choppy and then clumsily striped to tie it all together with a 60 second feel-good montage at the end to try to make you forget all the missing lives in the middle. Overall, if you're needing a holiday fix go for it. Make sure you're a little tipsy and have realistic expectations .",
    "69": "The premise of the entire movie is that the petty main character can't stand her friend since she always sends Christmas letters talking about how happy her family is. The leads to some very thin tension.The acting is some of the worst I've ever seen. The story line makes little to no sense. I had to watch this just to experience the train wreck this movie truly is.Im honestly not sure the director knew what was going on for half of the movie. The kids are probably the only slightly believable characters, and for some reason they had to push that by saying the girl was smart enough to get accepted into Harvard as a child. Why?? Terrible movie with no substance.",
    "70": "I was so excited to watch a new Christmas movie and seeing familiar faces gave me hope. The movie had a solid, good first three to five minutes before it turned to, how someone else has summed it up, a Hallmark channel type movie.Acting wasn't great at all. Jason is probably the only actor I didn't detest watching, but the rest were overplaying it. So many fake eye drops down those faces...scrunched up expressions and just a subpar script. I didn't get through the entire movie and I left only 15mins unwatched, but I got the point and it wasn't going to be salvaged at the end I'm sure.It's back to the classic Christmas movies for this household.",
    "71": "I'm not even sure what I just watched. Characters are cardboard flat, relationships fake as hell, dialogues criminal, plot inconsistent, aimless and boring.It's hard to believe all these people put in work into this pointless storyline. Literally maybe one half funny scene.Creators just kept throwing anything Christmas related they could think of at the wall to see what sticks, but what we got is a movie that's not sure what story it wants to tell, and no idea how to tell that story.I gave it a chance because of some names, and while Jason Biggs was neutral-decent (or just being himself), others were disappointing.",
    "72": "I can't get over how bad the acting is. It's either over-the-top or underwhelming - it just never seems to meet the moment. You certainly get the concept of what it's supposed to be, but the funny lines fall flat, the drama doesn't connect, and everything feels superficial. There's no depth. I think the plot had some potential.. that wasn't bad. Everything else was. There's an emotional and deep twist in the end but it was revealed and delivered so poorly. I was happy to see the cast, especially Brandy, a singer with whom I grew up in the 90s. I wanted to like this movie so badly. But man, I think even Hallmark would've done better job with this. If you can get past the bad acting and watch it with people who are less critical, you might actually enjoy it because the plot line isn't bad and it tugs at the heartstrings.",
    "73": "I liked this movie. I don't understand why the reviews reflect that it's bad and or weird. It was in my opinion, different. Not the typical boy meets girl and initially hate each other. So many especially Christmas movies, follow the same plot. This did not and because of that, I really liked it. The characters played their parts very well. I do have to agree with 1 reviewer, it was a rushed ending. It could have been even better with more exploration. But hey, it's a Christmas movie. Aren't Christmas Rom/Com movie supposed to be fun and entertaining? I definitely recommended this to my good friends who like to be entertained. Great movie!",
    "74": "I'm redressing the balance because of those Mean Mr. And Mrs Grinch's leaving poor marks. A stellar cast, no scratch that, it's actually inspired. Heather Graham as a Mum is an Oscar worthy performance. But getting Jason Biggs out of retirement is a master stroke. I did think it was Justin Long for 15 minutes but then I came to my senses. Duh! This film has everything you need in Christmas film; snappy dialogue, especially the use of \"Rock Star\", cute kids, Christmas Spirit in abundance and a worthy Christmas message. What more could you ask for? Well, that wonderful maker of family dramas Hallmark must be quaking in their boots because Netflix has really upped its game in 2023.",
    "75": "\"Best Christmas Ever\" on Netflix starts with a promising premise, offering hope for a delightful holiday movie. The initial 20 minutes captivate the audience with anticipation, but unfortunately, the film takes a disappointing turn downhill. As is often the case with Netflix originals, the plot fails to sustain its early charm, leaving viewers with a dull and unfulfilling experience. Despite the potential hinted at the beginning, the movie struggles to maintain engagement, and the overall execution falls short of creating a truly enjoyable Christmas flick. Disappointingly, it joins the ranks of other Netflix originals that fail to live up to expectations, missing the mark for those seeking a truly memorable holiday movie night.",
    "76": "I am not the biggest fan of Hallmark-like movies, but with working from home during the holidays I like to put something on in the background. It was nice to see something different from the typical someone moving from the big city, finding love, and getting married all within a month time frame ridiculousness. So, I am not understanding the hate this movie is receiving. Is it because it a heartfelt movie with Christian qualities of friendship, love, and forgiveness? I kept waiting for the plot to get ridiculous and everything just crumble in misery due to lies and deceit, but it never happened. Was it over the top? Absolutely, but that is what you look for in a Christmas movie. No one was lying or being a bully. It showed we can have a movie where couples are open and honest to their partners, mistakes can be fixed, and there is true love and not just infatuation that lasts a season. If you are against anything with a Christian-like message this movie is not for you. If you want a family friendly flick that you don't want to take too seriously and just enjoy time together then give it a shot.",
    "77": "We did not finish watching this movie. It was cringey and very inappropriate. It had sex references between the adults. There is a scene where there is one couple in one room and in the next room another couple and they are banging on the wall causing the other couples bed frame to rock back and forth. Then at breakfast the next morning the kids ask about the noises and they go on to say that their parents never make noise like that at night. It's really cringy. I even had to double check if it was PG. Also if the kids don't understand these jokes it's super weird and inappropriate to put something like that in a kids movie.",

My wife and I really enjoyed this movie and found a lot of the stuff relatable (including the cringy Christmas letter). We thought the actors actually did a really nice job! The kids were cute and at times reminded us of things our kids might say or do. Overall, we enjoyed some laughs and some relatable tears at one part (I won't spoil it for anyone).

Brandy and this other guy?! More cringe-worthy of a couple selection. Terribly directed too! A forced over-acted mess. Awful story line, ridiculous! It's the Gremlins 2 of a Christmas movie.. just a bunch of crap. The child actors were even unlikable.. HOW DID THESE ACTORS SIGN ON TO THIS PROJECT??! They've got to be so embarassed..

    "81": "I'll start by saying I can definitely appreciate a nice cheesy Christmas movie so when I saw familiar faces starring in this one, I had high hopes. Right off the bat, the acting was awful and it definitely did not get any better throughout. The acting was SO bad and terribly unbelievable. Impossible to connect with the characters since none of their words, actions or feelings came off as sincere or relatable. Charlotte is looking for her lost kid with a fake little sad face and seemingly no panic? I also felt that the movie would jump around with little to no explanation. Mom breaks the dollhouse and is eventually seen talking about how it can be fixed and boom, next day it's a beautifully crafted creation again without seeing anyone work on it.Charlotte's son runs away and she finds her son at a restaurant. Inside, she sees on TV that her company isn't doing well. Next scene, it cuts to her bursting into Jackie's office to tell her about her company and she's wearing different clothes ?? No consequence or lecture to the kid about running away - just drops him off at a Jackie's house and says he's fine! She crashed her car and a girl is walking to the Christmas event in town but through the woods? We find out Jackie's son had died but no one talks about how? I rarely ever leave movie reviews but man I really felt like voicing my opinion on this one.

There were random things throughout the movie with no back story or explanation or follow up. The movie ended and they had to put one last scene saying, oh yeah, and this, this and this.I watched this yesterday and have been thinking about it for a solid 24 hours, just getting more confused about what I watched and more annoyed I lost 80 minutes of my life.",

The bar is pretty low for Christmas movies, but this one doesn't make it. Mostly cringe moments, very few laughs. Then they try to tug on your heartstrings, but by then you're so bottomed out by the stupidity that it doesn't even make it. It's such a shame because it hand some talent involved.

I don't know who this movie is for either - it's not particularly funny or thoughtful so adults will be bored by it, and the themes are a little too much for kids to comprehend and the jokes aren't for them either so I dunno.The actors are honestly trying and they're not the problem at all. It's just lazily and cheaply done and is another in a long list of bad Xmas movies nobody will ever watch but NF shareholders will be told that 'there's now 2000 holiday movies on the service so we will def attract more subscribers with them!'And the ending is so rushed and out of nowhere that it reminded me of the ending to CATS. Which is never a good sign. And it starts with a character talking right to the camera - which is then never done again.Skip this one, it doesn't even have the light hearted whimsy that other Xmas flicks have. It's serious and boring and I wish the leads had better material to work with...",
    "87": "Don't waste your time with this turd. I get that we shouldn't expect a Scorsese style of production for a Christmas movie but at least make the characters somewhat believable. I agree with everyone saying that Brandy's acting was way off, although she felt like a real shallow person to me so that wasn't what bothered me. What bothered me was how lazily written out some of the plot points were... It felt like they were trying to make one of those traditional family movies but this movie had so many wtf moments and none of the charm, none of the spirit and none of the wit of those classic Christmas movies.Also, the suspension 9f disbelief this movie asks of you is just ridiculous even for a Christmas movie! Someone asked who this was made for and I can't help but ask the same question. If it was made for kids it was made by someone who has a very poor understanding of what kids find entertaining and if it was made for adults, they needed to try harder because none of their jokes landed except for maybe one or two. Avoid at all costs!",
    "88": "I don't understand it. On paper this should have been a decent watch. Brandy, Heather Graham, that guy off of American Pie; a bit of festive fun for a lazy day on the sofa. But it was appalling.I'm sorry but the script was terrible; the main reason for them staying at the house (the snow being the macguffin) is melted away the next day!! So less than a quarter of the way in you're left thinking, why haven't they gone to the sisters now?! It also shifts all over the place with no main story arc, suddenly it's about the band getting back together, then yay the model village, then it's about a runaway boy...The actors are OTT and stilted trying to compensate for a dreadful script, and there was a serious lack of chemistry. Heather as one of the main characters isn't at all likeable, she doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities. In fact no-one are really likeable - the genius daughter was beyond obnoxious, Jackie is disgustingly sucessful with no flaws to make her charater endearing.Also I have no idea how this was ever billed as a comedy, maybe the writers all went on strike before the jokes were written, as there were none at all. Not even a bit of home-alone-esque slapstick.Oh and a weirdly sexual kiss near the middle may be more suited to some of Heather's earlier work? Weird.I sound really mean but genuinely can't think of anything good to say about this, and I'm frustrated that I spent my prescious time watching it.Line of the film - \"It's cultural\"... \"It better be\" ...huh??",
    "89": "During the first 30 minutes I actually enjoyed the movie. Then I don't know what happened to the story line but it just got awkward. The whole fake snow was ridiculous, all the minor \"stunts\" where filmed in a such way that you could only see half of the person cause they were clealrly done in a studio setting. Why not just do a couple real stunts to add credibility?Then the characters, one is always happy and understanding and other kinda the opposite. This type of roles are just bad and lazy writing. I don't know what the main idea was in the end but didn't have much to do with Christmas.I'd say you can keep this one on the background while prepping for Christmas but don't waste all concentration on this.3/10 cause Biggs' characters is nice and as mentioned, first 30 mins are okay.",
    "90": "It's difficult to imagine there being a worse movie out there. It was entirely incoherent and ridiculous.I gave it a 2 because it was so bad it was actually laughable. It made us laugh out loud, albeit at it and not with it.I concur with others who say Chat GPT must have written it.The highlight of the movie was hearing Brandi sing Christmas carols and I can't help but wonder why they didn't lean more into that. This movie could have revolved entirely around her singing and it would have been so much better.I couldn't help but recall the end of the movie Billy Madison with the line about everyone in here being dumber for having heard Billy's nonsensical response to a question. That is exactly what I feel after this movie.",
    "91": "This was such a bad movie, I even opened an IMDb account just to rate it and to potentially help avoid other people losing an hour and a half of their lives.We continued watching it to see whether it got any better. Sadly it didn't.The acting was awful, the storyline was no better.It was so predictable and lame.I love a good Christmas movie as much as the rest of them, and when this was advertised and number one in the Netflix charts, we were excited and sat down with popcorn. My 12-year-old walked out, my 20-year-old started drinking vodka, my other half opened the whiskey, having to drink to get through a movie wasn't the highlight of our night or our lives, we regretted it more in the morning.",
    "92": "\"Best Christmas Ever\" promised to be a holiday treat, but instead, it left audiences scratching their heads and wondering what went wrong. The film attempted to blend the holiday spirit with elements of classic comedies, but the execution fell flat, resulting in a disappointing cinematic experience.One of the biggest letdowns was the misuse of talented actors from iconic roles. The inclusion of the 'rollergirl' and the 'guy who went deep in American Pie' seemed like a desperate attempt to capitalize on their past successes. Unfortunately, their characters were poorly written and lacked depth, making it difficult for audiences to connect with or care about their fates.The plot itself was a convoluted mess, attempting to weave together multiple storylines that ultimately went nowhere. The attempts at humor felt forced, and the jokes often fell flat, leaving the audience with awkward silences instead of laughter. The film's pacing was inconsistent, with scenes dragging on unnecessarily while important plot points were rushed, leaving viewers bewildered.The production quality was subpar, with lackluster cinematography and unimpressive set designs. The special effects, particularly in the Christmas-themed scenes, were unconvincing and failed to capture the magic of the holiday season.The soundtrack, supposedly a crucial element in a holiday film, was forgettable at best. There were no memorable tunes or heartwarming melodies to enhance the festive atmosphere. Instead, the music seemed like an afterthought, contributing little to the overall viewing experience.\"Best Christmas Ever\" had the potential to be a heartwarming and humorous addition to the holiday movie lineup, but it ultimately fell short of expectations. The mishandling of beloved actors and a poorly executed plot make it a forgettable entry in the Christmas movie genre. Save yourself the disappointment and opt for a classic holiday favorite instead.",
    "93": "I'm not sure why people expect Oscar quality in Christmas movies.Scripts and themes are pretty standard and it mainly falls to whether you like the stars.So, do you like Heather Graham and Brandi?You'll be fine.The plot, I'll admit is a mix of simple concept (those irritating holiday newsletters) and flat out weird ( solar balloons and chip mitts-- this feels very influencer woo woo) But it's certainly not the worst movie ever and is kind of fun in parts.The kids were cute, as were the husbands. The town was your typical Christmas quaint with support townies to match.At first the ending felt oddly unfinished until I realized some threads were wrapped after the credits started to roll.So don't tune out too soon.",
    "94": "Charlotte Sanders is leading a normal life but is completely jealous of her friend Jackie Jennings's life. She cannot bear the yearly newsletter Jackie posts, boasting about her family's accomplishments. This irks Charlotte enough undermine her own family in comparison. What happens when her son misunderstands her sarcasm and orchastrates an unannounced visit to Jackie's house for spending Christmas forms rest of the story.Putting it out straightaway, the film is simply not funny. The only strength it relies on is it being a Christmas film for the families and that's about it. The moment Charlotte is introduced, reading Jackie's newsletter and acting all jealous, the film stops trying. The only other scene that works is the bank loan scene with the kid and that too briefly. Rest of the film is just as painful as the characters are and the attempt at humor looks forced and those scenes being unfunny doesn't help either.There are moments where characters go through a crisis but they barely feel affected by it and probably this is a Christmas film, it had very less scope to show any of those emotions. The problems are bound to be resolved sooner. So the kids have their subplot involving Santa Claus's existence and the adults get to overcome their insecurities and rejuvenate their friendship because it's Christmas. A dollhouse which took months to build can be re-built overnight so there isn't much left to criticize.",
    "95": "I'm a sucker for a good sappy Christmas movie and I can forgive a lot of bad acting for a cheesy holiday plot and some good old fashioned romance. This movie fulfilled NONE of my expectations and the acting was worse than those wonderfully mushy Hallmark movies. I'm not even sure this was a CHRISTMAS movie at all.To start off, the two married couples spend the first half of the movie lusting after each other's spouses (very strange and not at all authentic). This never gets unpacked or apologized for, just glossed over. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop with Brandy's character and make her more likeable. Yes there was a bit of a sad backstory but even that does not erase the supposed perfection of her life.All of it was about attaining wealth as the main point of life, and about hollow jealousy and dissatisfaction of comparing yourself to others. It by no means brings authenticity, depth, gratitude or appreciation, all of which are much more important than wealth and accomplishment. Of course it did not touch the real meaning of Christmas or even get slightly close to it. It kind of mimics the elements of a bunch of Christmas movies and cobbles them all together into a bland, strange, stinky cheese kind of movie.It was barely funny, eliciting nary a smile. It was barely sad, not being invested or attached to any of the characters. It was barely romance, with no believability of the attraction for their own spouses. It was not made for kids (not funny or good), nor adults (not deep, not clever, no real message, too cliche).The main reason I wasted an hour and a half is I had to see where it was going and how it was going to remedy these situations or wrap up any of the plots. In the end it was just a waste of time. Watch anything else instead.",
    "96": "Like all movies made in 2022 & 2023; STERILE!Like so many reviewers have so aptly stated:Unfunny to the nth degreeEnvy & Jealousy. And why? Everybody is impotent in this movie, including the women somehow.And what's with the disappearing & reappearing snow?The writing was so poor, I honestly believe it would have been a much better movie, had all of the actors and actresses adlibbed ALL of their lines.My wife watches every Xmas movie, including Hallmark, Lifetime and Hollywood productions. There's maybe 20 movies in our \"My Stuff\" recorded file! I have to scroll three pages just to find the NFL games I recorded. And then, once recorded, my lovely wife forgets to uncheck the \"Record\" prompt, so they keep reappearing after deletion!But I like a few of them. Evie likes ALL OF THEM. UNTIL NOW!!It was she that said \"Hey honey! Please shut this tripe off; it's just horrendously bad\".Me: \"Hallelujah!!\"Refusing to really watch this movie; I was instead, working a Kakuro puzzle, and just the sound was annoying.Like all 2023 movies, in its attempt not offend anybody, the writing & acting instead, offended everybody.Trying to find a good movie these days is nearly impossible. There are countless studies & articles clearly identifying the \"Tidal Wave of Dumb\" washing over America. Academically, the US has managed to make it to last place among developed countries. We were #1 in 1977, not coincidentally, just before the Department of Education was established by the arab financed peanut farmer.Well, looks like the new blockheads on block made their way into the studios too. Because films today are, by and large, just plain unwatchable.It is what it is.Sorry for the diatribe.",
    "97": "Reading some of these reviews, you'd think they'd watched Sharknado or something, haha! Rating it a 1 or 2 stars is a little too unforgiving, as it is far from the worst movie ever made.I guess if I'd gone in hoping to have my mind blown, I would have been more disappointed, but you can easily tell from the trailer/teaser content that this is \"just another Hallmark/Lifetime-eque Christmas movie\" -- so I went in with that expectation, and I feel like it delivered just a little bit less than that (but not all that much).To me, the main problems are:1) The acting: Heather Graham and Jason Biggs seem bored out of their minds delivering their lines. That was one of the most glaring flaws. I thought Brandy did a much better job of acting than Heather! I was rather annoyed by the OVERacting of one of the kids (who played Brandy's character's daughter). Other than that, the rest of the characters really weren't very well-acted at all.2) The plot had some weirdness to it and just wasn't very tight. It didn't stick to the basic premise, and if it had, perhaps the viewer would be more drawn into the emotions and actually FEEL something about these characters. Instead, it had too many small-ish/weird-ish little things going on that distracted from the central premise3) And then, of course, the very awkward \"twist\" (which any thinking person can see coming a mile away) that is SUPER strange. Without giving a spoiler, let's just say it's not something that would ever happen with mentally healthy people. If someone carried on with a falsehood the way this particular character did, they would be urged to seek treatment for their mental health (I'm not stigmatizing that treatment -- just saying what the character did was NOT \"normal\"). I only bring that part up because it was super weird to have it get plopped into a Hallmark-style Christmas movie. It was like, \"Seriously? Are we gonna go there?\"Even with those flaws, I didn't hate it: the pace moved along, the wardrobe and scenery were nice to look at, and it wasn't filled to the brim with \"what the heck is this tripe?\" moments. I suppose that means my bar is set fairly low, but honestly, there are very few REALLY good Christmas movies these days, so my bar IS set low, and this one *almost* cleared it. For that, I give it 4 stars.",
    "98": "The conversation between the two spouses seemed to promote spouses gazing at each other's partners, which I found quite irritating due to its seemingly inappropriate sexual references in a PG context..Certainly! Here's an expanded version:I found myself feeling rather perturbed by the discussion unfolding between the two spouses. It appeared as though they were advocating for a behavior that involved partners casting prolonged glances at each other's spouses, which struck me as disconcerting. This seemingly innocuous conversation took an uncomfortable turn with repeated references that seemed to carry undertones of a more intimate and private nature. Such overt allusions to physical attraction and intimacy between spouses felt quite out of place within what was supposed to be a context suitable for a PG-rated conversation.",
    "99": "The acting is fine.Production nice.First 2/3 of the movie is worth watching as a typical christmas movie.But it gets a bit rushed and forced at the end. And not credible.And the storyline about the son who was out saving the world could have been done in a way more believeable. It was almost strange finding out the details. Of course I will not spoil anything, so I won't go any further regarding this.The kids' acting lifted the movie. They were all good.I just don't buy the magic Santa moment.However. I don't think it was a total waste of time watching this. There are a lot worse holiday movies out there.",
    "100": "I know Christmas movies are supposed to be light-hearted fluff pieces but with this stellar cast I will admit to having greater expectations than I should have. That being said, poor Brandy, Jason, and Heather had to do a marathon run from dramatic plot point to dramatic plot point. None of them are bad actors, either, in fact I feel they lifted the movie up quite a bit but the movie doesn't really allow for much reflection before we're on to the next, and doesn't allow the audience to really feel anything for any of the characters. Also, whoever decided to have Heather getting kicked in the gut be a comedic plot point is sick.Can we please have a spin off exploring Monkey Bob's origin story? I'd love to know more about how this covert homicidal manic wound up a part of this family.I will say, regardless of what this movie tries to say, Brandy's character really seems quite delightful for someone who is supposed to be an uppity, pretentious, and annoying person. I almost feel like we are just seeing Brandy just being her actual self and I would totally love to spend Christmas with her.",
    "101": "First: I LOVE cheesy christmas movies, and think they are to be rated in their own category. They're supposed to be cheesy and pretty and make you feel good.This film was quite cheesy and it was very pretty, but it didn't leave me feeling good at all. I'm not sure who is the target audience with this, maybe some well-off family people who feel the pressure of making their life look extra good can relate?I thought the actors did their job alright (again, for this genre), but the chemistry and relations between the characters just missed the mark for me completely. I liked the beginning, it seemed promising and had all the tools to make a nice, campy movie, but the plotlines didn't make it there at all.This was marked as a romantic comedy, but it completely failed at comedy, and the romantic part... Well, barely there. I would've played the friendship aspect more heavily and written a completely different ending. There were many points where a truly heartfelt and warm moments were totally possible, but they just weren't there?Didn't leave me feeling soft and/or cheerful at all, instead I'm slightly annoyed, and a bit confused about the lesson of this movie: don't be bitter or grumpy, be happy and thankful and you too shall achieve wealth. Because that is what this movie seemed to be about.",
    "102": "There's a fine line between trashy and feel good when it comes to Netflix Christmas films and they're usually pretty good at finding said line.This film takes that line and savagely beats it until nothing is left but an empty husk of the tropes you actually want to enjoy when you watch a Christmas film.Life is hard, sometimes you want to unwind with silly. But even then there was to be a minimum standard to the writing. Chat gpt could have written this better.Did you ever see isn't it romantic? You know when all the characters are delivering their lines in a super cheesy but self aware way because that's literally the plot? Well it's like that, except in this case it is actually the best they can do. There are sueded films out there with better acting.Instead of watching this film, may I recommend you spend your time doing something more pleasant and less hurtful to your soul? Perhaps you could undergo surgery without anaesthetic? It would certainly be an improvement over this particular Christmas.",
    "103": "Skip, even if you make it your goal to watch all Christmas movies. I was excited to watch this film because of Brandy. She is so talented, beautiful, and elegant on screen. Why this film? Why? There's another young actress who was also in the new film Dashing Through the Snow (on Disney+ from 2023) and she was excellent in both films but this movie fails to showcase the incredible talent in this film. This movie has unnecessary adult elements that are awkward and uncomfortable. The husband is cruel and the blonde mother is treated like a fool for reasonable issues. Just another Christmas movie that picks on a parent for not being perfect. You can say it's a criticism on parents being unjustly scrutinized during the holidays but there's no glory at the end of these films for these parents. Ever. Other than their kids and family loving them again despite their massive failures. This film seems like it's going to end three times and it just won't quit. I saw a review saying that this film seemed like it was written by AI. Absolutely. The characters are hardly likable and the storyline is nonsensical. It could have been a beautiful story with Brandy's character's ability to love and give love despite the ugliness of life and the hurt she suffers at the hands of others. But no. We all expect Christmas movies to be corny, and many of us welcome it, but it was weirdly inappropriate like it was fit awkwardly in as an after-thought. I am glad i watched this movie so I could earn family members, as many people can only watch 20-40 movies a holiday season and that's with great effort. Do not waste your time on this film. Watch another. It's not corny. It's uncomfortable and nonsensical. Blatantly nonsensical. It hurts the brain. It has the trope of the inadequate mom, the secretly absent family member, the talent show to showcase the actor's singing, the person who looks so perfect but actually isn't. You can get these elements elsewhere and it'll be far better. You've been warned.",
    "104": "Created an account specifically to rate this movie. I really liked this movie. It was a nice wholesome movie to watch alone or with the kids. (Which is seldom now a days. Never know what messages Media/Netflix try to give your kids.) But it was fun and sweet.It had cringy parts but thats apart of any Hallmarkish Christmas movie. We laughed hard a couple times. I usually hate musicals or singing in movies but i deeply enjoyed hearing brandy sing.This movie had really good messages involved:\n1. You get what you think you will. Think positively you get positive. Think negatively you get negative. It's the law of nature.2. Everyone's life looks different. There are people out here living the dream. There are some that are not. The difference: Optimism and Pessimism.3. To forgive is to forget.The messages go on and on. All positive if you pay attention.One thing I hate about media is their is always a tragedy of some sort. Talk about unrealistic.Besides that I deeply enjoyed this movie. Will add to my Christmas Movie Playlist. I recommend to all who loves Christmas Movies and all who have children/teens.",
    "105": "Oh my stars I do believe this might be the worst Christmas movie I have ever seen, even worse than 4 Christmases.It felt like they cobbled the story together from at least 4 trite Christmas movie tropes. Add to that bad acting, bad writing, and an utter lack of chemistry between any of the actors and it was like a sleigh crash that I just couldn't look away from.I didn't think it could get worse but the ending took it from 2 stars to 1.It seems it's not just tradition that causes people to watch old Christmas movies over and over; it's partly because the new ones are only slightly less horrible than this catastrophe.Do yourself a favor and avoid this like a Christmas fruitcake."
