    "0": "\"The Marvels\" is the sequel to 2019's \"Captain Marvel\", a continuation of the Disney+ series \"Ms. Marvel\", and the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, it represents a painful look at the downward spiral the MCU has found itself caught in since the end of Phase 3.Sometime after the events of \"Captain Marvel\", Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) has unintentionally started a civil war among the alien race known as the Kree. The leader of the Kree, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), soon finds one half of the Quantum Bands and later seeks out the other half, which is in the possession of Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani). At the request of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Carol teams up with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) to negotiate peace among the Kree, but as the two investigate a wormhole in outer space, Monica, Carol, and Kamala start mysteriously switching powers with one another. Realising something is amiss, the trio are forced to work together to figure out what is causing this strange phenomena and hopefully put a stop to both Dar-Benn and the warring Kree.It's becoming harder and harder to call myself fan of the MCU, given the array of serviceable to terrible projects they have been churning out lately. To be fair though, it is a tall order to top something as ambitious as the culmination of over ten years worth of universe building after both \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" pulled it off so effectively years ago. For the longest time, I have been willing to defend the post-Endgame MCU for trying different things, as I was under the impression that all of this would be leading to exciting new projects on the horizon. However, after sitting through \"The Marvels\", I can say with a hint of heartbreak that practically all of my optimism for the MCU's future has all but disappeared, as it contains next to nothing worth defending from a creative standpoint.Perhaps the best way to describe my viewing experience with this film would be \"apathetic\", because at no point does it ever feel like anything important is at stake. This is mainly due to either our three heroes being too overpowered or there not being enough information provided about the ones who need saving. Whenever a horde of enemies are swarming the trio, we watch as the three of them effortlessly take them out without even breaking a sweat. Action-packed moments like these that once elicited excitement have now been reduced to a series of bland fistfights and generic CGI blasts that have all been done before in better MCU films.We see Carol Danvers quickly blast everyone away with her energy beams and block punches with her hands, never once showing any signs that she is in real danger. Her accomplice Monica Rambeau does pretty much the same thing, only with less time on screen. Even Kamala Khan, who is the biggest fish-out-of-water in this situation, has no major trouble dealing with foes coming at her from every angle, always using her half of the Quantum Band to her advantage. How is it possible to keep the audience on their toes if the enemy forces are so inefficient that even an inexperienced child can wipe the floor with them this easily? On that note, it also doesn't help that none of these three heroes appear to have any physical weaknesses or personal insecurities holding them back, which causes all of the tension to evaporate instantly.In addition to this, we are barely shown anything interesting about the Kree that will keep the audience invested in their role in the story. As far as the film is concerned, they are nothing more than a stock species of extraterrestrials that are causing problems simply because the plot demands it. The original \"Captain Marvel\" film established that the Kree were the ones who inadvertently gave Carol her powers and took her in among them. Yet, this film never reminds the audience of that, instead opting to throw them right into the thick of the conflict without any important context. As a result, I just did not care at all about what happened to any of these people.It's also worth mentioning that this film is rife with obvious re-edits and tonal inconsistencies. One scene where this is most evident is where Carol Danvers is opening up to both Rambeau and Khan about her relationship with the Kree. What could have been a good method of showcasing Danvers's humanity is instead brushed aside for something completely unrelated after less than two minutes. I couldn't help but assume that this scene was supposed to go on much longer but was cut in post production for whatever reason. To add insult to injury, the scene is then immediately followed by a strange attempt at comic relief which fails to raise even a single laugh. Although Marvel films are known for their blending of comedy with drama, a moment like this felt like a rather tacky addition to the film that only hampers the already poor narrative structure. Worse still, there are other similar occurrences like this throughout the rest of the story.One of the biggest problems with the original \"Captain Marvel\" film was how weakly written the title character was, with her lack of likeable character traits and overly serious demeanour being a major reason why she is not viewed favourably by fans. You'd expect the filmmakers to remedy this problem for the sequel, but you would be wrong. I'm not sure whether it's Brie Larson's underwhelming performance or just plain old bad writing but I have never once felt any fondness for Carol Danvers as a person. As mentioned above, she efficiently fights her way through many bad guys with no issue whatsoever, never once showing any emotional weakness or other potential vulnerabilities. Because of this, Carol Danvers never feels like a real person, being nothing more than a one-dimensional superhero that is practically impossible for anybody to identify with. Her character has not changed or grown since the first film, and it looks like she won't be doing so anytime soon.I keep trying to remind myself of Monica Rambeau's contribution to the story but nothing memorable ever comes to mind without doing some kind of online research. Like Brie Larson, there is nothing especially remarkable about Teyonah Parris's performance, as her character is as bland as she comes. Though it is established that Rambeau looked up to Carol Danvers as a child, her role in this story is nothing more than playing second fiddle to an already dull lead protagonist. Yes, Rambeau is very strong and yes, she is more than capable of taking care of herself in a fight, but beyond that what else does she offer? Most of the time she just goes along with Danvers's orders without ever questioning her or giving her personal opinions, making her nothing more than a blind follower. I was hoping to have seen some kind of opposing dynamic between Danvers and Rambeau, as that would have given their characters an important amount of depth the distinguish the two from one another. No such luck I'm afraid.The only character I sort of cared about was Kamala Khan, whose childlike naivet√© made her the most relatable of the three leads. In her feature film debut, Iman Vellani does carry over many of Khan's human traits from the Disney+ series \"Ms. Marvel\", being that she's still young and coming to terms with mastering her powers. Unfortunately, she does not achieve this through the character herself, but rather due to how woefully underwritten her two co-stars are in comparison. I wanted to see the three as kindred spirits, fighting as trio but standing out as individuals. Instead, all we get are two dull, stoic, overpowered adults and a young kid working together for no other reason than because the writers said so.As depressing as it sounds, the once mighty MCU is showing no signs of improvement as \"The Marvels\" just may be the worst film in the series so far. There simply isn't enough reason to justify its existence outside of some kind of contractual obligation by the higher ups at Disney, and I fully respect many people's decision to skip it altogether. At this point, I seriously doubt the MCU can ever return to its former glory, as this film is set to become the series' biggest box office bomb to date. I can only hope in vain that Disney will learn an important lesson from this film's failure, but knowing their track record that seems unlikely.I rate it 4/10.",
    "1": "Anyone who heard the news about this project knows that the production was a nightmare, and it shows in the final product here. It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting.",
    "2": "Even writing a review is extremely pointless as we all knew what we were expecting months before but here I am. They even themselves admitted it. The film is a huge disappointment. The plot is all over the place. Actions sequences were sometimes good but sometime were so dumb I didn't know where to look, where to pay attention. I like how they tried to catch the old marvel magic. Yes. They tried. But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off \"wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring\" trick again. And it wasn't a \"wow\" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right. Every character there is comic relief. And I absolutely don't wanna talk about acting.",
    "3": "Criticizing specific parts of the movie became confusing for me as there were so many details I wanted to change. This film truly disappointed me, especially since my expectations were already low, and falling below them is a bad sign for Marvel. It had a Thor: Love and Thunder vibe, which I also disliked (4/10). I had been excited after watching Loki in the morning, but it was in vain.For me, the unbearable part was the music. After checking the playlists of movies I've watched for a long time, Marvel had by far the worst compositions. The music was exaggerated, drowning out the impact of fight scenes and making them unbearable. It was like overly noisy background music during a break.Another aspect I didn't like was the main villain. I can't believe Marvel fell into the same mistake again. The villain was poorly written, and Zawe Ashton's performance felt forced, appearing awkward in scenes. One major reason for this was the poor portrayal of the Kree Empire in the MCU. Neglecting the significance of the Kree made Supreme look bad. They could have explained the critical situation of the 'Hala' planet in the film's opening with a 30-35 minute sequence, providing context for the desperation of the Kree.Another thing I found absurd was Monica teleporting to a parallel universe. They portrayed the concept of parallel universes like child's play. Especially after watching Loki Season 2 in the morning, her randomly teleporting or getting stuck in another universe seemed too simplistic.Seeing Professor Beast was surprising and pleasing. The X-Men era is beginning, and despite the poor productions, I'm excited. Brie Larson was good again, carrying her character well. The scene with Monica, Kamala, Danvers vs Dar-Benn was good, thankfully without music. However, despite not being a fan of Kamala Khan, her origin is preserved, and it's not bad. But I feel there's a lack of harmony among our main three characters, and I believe it's a script issue, not an actor one.While I like the idea of saving a planet by traveling through different planets, I didn't like the execution at all. Presenting such a serious and contemporary issue as if it's the simplest thing with childlike music seems somewhat unserious to me.However it turns out, this film paved the way for others and served as a stepping stone. Hopefully, with Beast in Deadpool 3, the overall MCU storyline will improve, abandoning mediocrity urgently; otherwise, it will continue to receive poor ratings.Note: I forgot to mention in the review, but Goose is a fantastic character, and I hope we continue to see this adorable cat. The scene with all the cats was genuinely entertaining, one of the enjoyable moments in 4-5 scenes.",
    "4": "Listen, many of us have watched the MCU films and have learned that there needs to be a cohesiveness and strong villain that drives the movie. Following that thought, every good superhero movie is really more about the villain and the follow-on hero growth/action arcs that result from confronting and besting said villain. Zoom out on the early Avengers movies and you can see all that displayed because of Thanos. Some MCU movies do that better than others, and even a few DC movies nick it as well. Others fail miserably such as Ant Man Quantum thing, Shazam 1& 2 (crap big time), and WW 2 But this, this hunk of junk excuse for a movie, OMG! There were sooo many cringy scenes, biggest was the singing/dancing people! I think that was jammed in to give this schlock movie some sort of Indian/Bollwood flavor/nod because of that cringy Kamala Khan and family. UGG! This movie truly lacks any appeal. No one could even care about the villain or the vastly over used cats-eating-people to save them during a space station evac that didn't even need to be evacuated. That effect was cute and kinda jump-scary in the first move but should've stayed there. If you want a 3-second overview: It's a movie about people switching places, cats that eat people, and a lady that steals air, water, and sun. Trust me. You will regret paying to watch this. That's the whole story. No twist endings. It adds nothing to the MCU timeline and could be/should be the death-knell for Capt Marvel. It's worthless and completely forgettable. For a spot-on review, go watch the Critical Drinkers YT review. MCU needs to come up with something much, much better to save itself. I can only think that something along the lines of a Fantastic Four reboot with a Silver Surfer and a PROPER Galactus representation and arc could put the MCU back at the top. This Marvels dreck needs to be sunk into the Sun, never to return. Go away now.",
    "5": "\"The Marvels\" ambitiously attempts to intertwine the lives of its three heroines, yet the film stumbles, failing to reach the high standards set by its Marvel Cinematic Universe predecessors. The central plot mechanism, a fantastical swapping of places, comes off as a gimmick rather than an integral story element. This constant shifting hampers the development of the characters and the progression of the plot.The film's narrative, exploring intergalactic conflicts and alliances, is neither original nor engaging, missing the opportunity to delve deeper into potentially intriguing political dynamics. Additionally, the use of quantum entanglement as a plot device feels more like a convenient narrative crutch than a well-integrated scientific concept.Director Nia DaCosta's vision for \"The Marvels\" is lost amidst these narrative missteps, leaving the film feeling disjointed and lackluster. The rich character potential of Danvers, Rambeau, and Khan is underutilized, resulting in a movie that feels more like a placeholder in the MCU than a significant contribution.In summary, \"The Marvels\" is a disappointing chapter in the MCU saga, lacking the depth, coherence, and excitement that fans have come to expect from the franchise.",
    "6": "Unfortunately if you haven't got Disney plus and you don't keep to speed with the tv series, then you this movie won't make much sense as it relies on you knowing what's going on in that universe so far, which I'm not up to date with and involves the Miss Marvels characters which haven't been introduced in the movies. Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has RocketüòÇIt's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly.",
    "7": "This film felt like a \"Filler Movie\" to just create some potential future storylines. I am the exact type of fan that Marvel studios loves, because I go to every single movie (often 2-3 times per film), subscribe to all platforms, and I spend money on ALL of it. As a fan I would typically rate any Marvel film higher on IMDB because I want to see Marvel and the films succeed, but this one I rated a 4... I probably should have rated it a 3. If you went to see this movie and haven't kept up with all of the movies and Disney plus series, you will be scratching your head wondering what is going on. The Marvels is cringey in every possible way... the only part I enjoyed was the post credit scene. Marvel, please do better! As a fan I look forward to the blockbuster films and they have progressively gotten worse over the past 2 years. I wanted to love this movie and I truly was let down.",
    "8": "This movie features the most bland and uninteresting hero of all time. There is nothing to her character and the deadpan emotion of Brie Larson doesn't help the movie at all. Its just an overall snooze fest. Even looking for something to pass the time there are things more interesting than this movie like watching paint dry, seeing how fast grass can actually grow.The plot is nonsensical when you have someone that should know... do NOT TOUCH something actually touches it and the other person should know better and touches and now those two and a third are all entangled with their powers and now they need to learn how to work together to defeat the bad woman who is bad because she wants to save her planet that was destroyed by the \"hero.\"Do yourself a favor... watch anything else.",
    "9": "I saw in imax earlier today sure I can see why this got hate already but I enjoyed a lot. I like how tough the villain was it only strange how Carol is equally as powerful as Thanos was and still struggled to defeat Dar-Benn besides that there's a couple parts that I'm sure some were annoyed with. Regardless of that stuff I loved The Marvels definitely one of more satisfying superhero experiences to me especially if you void out the flaws or not mind them much. It's a spectacular film one of the shortest of the bunch too if it wasn't for half hour of trailers it would've felt like a breeze which is fine. I love the comedy, fur-balls are awesome, action was great, and plenty of hugging is always lovely!",
    "10": "After reading all the negative reviews I went into this with low expectations and it failed to meet even those! It was destroyed and poorly directed with a lack of motivation from all their characters. As for MCU movies, we are introduced to 2 new characters who just don't measure up to the rest of The Avengers. We have 114 year old Pakistani girl who is just happy to be there for 90 minutes but surprisingly can outfight trained assassins. Then we have Captain Marvel's best friend's child whose powers are never really flushed out in the movie. And then it goes off the rails for a while and becomes a musical. This movie is just a disaster. I saw it in a big theater with 4 other people in the whole place. I expect it will lose a lot of money. Do not recommend.",
    "11": "\"The Marvels\" is a cute kitten showreel with some superhero cosplaying served on the side.It truly felt as if they had plucked several random actresses off the street and asked them to do a superhero impression for 105 minutes. This girl-power group was, unfortunately, very wooden. Bar possibly Brie Larson as Captain Marvel, but even she looked a bit bewildered and gormless.Visuals were good, but an over-reliance on CGI was self-evident. The antagonist (Dar-Benn) felt straight out of a cheesy Sci-Fi from the seventies or eighties and the joke-to-serious ratio was (as usual for Marvel), off kilter.",
    "12": "I love this franchise to bits so it brings me absolutely no joy to report that this an absolute low point for the MCU and - after 33 movies - the first one that I really have to call bad.The Marvels is so poorly conceived and ineptly executed that it not only makes this the worst movie of the MCU but a contender for the very worst superhero movies of all time. The Marvels does so little right that it's almost shocking to see it make it into theaters in this state and even more shocking to see the \"Marvel Studios\" label up front.Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau and especially Kamala Khan have all been enjoyable characters in their respective movies and TV series. So instead of benefiting from that and offering engaging storytelling, we get dozens of flashes, bangs, utterly bad dialogue, a frustratingly messy script and a mountain of completely soul- and senseless action scenes that bend together as a big chunk of nothingness. It feels like bunch of seven year olds worked with a 270! Million budget. Even weirder is that that The Marvel's is shot by Stephen McQueen's immensely talented cinematographer Sean Bobbitt. So yeah, the movie looks good. It's like a 270! Million dollar glass filled with, yeah you know what.Of the cast, it's only Iman Vellani, as Marvel fangirl turned superhero Kamala Khan, who seems genuinely excited to be in the film. I feel bad for all the great actors in this (especially Sam Jackson, Brie Larson and Teyonah Parris) who tried breathing life into their characters but couldn't change the slightest about the mess they were cramed into.Even cameos from MCU fan-favorites (Hailee and Tessa) and a huge Post-Credit swinger couldn't bring any excitement.Dar-Benn is one of the worst written and acted villains I've ever seen.In no possible universe can Kevin Feige be satisfied with this mess of a movie. You see how much love and passion went into Loki and you see they still know how to do it. The Marvels is the the grand example how to not do it. There's no art pounding heart inside. This does not even feel like a movie but a product. It feels like made and produced by people who have never read a Marvel comic book.The Marvels rightfully becomes the first MCU flop, it will loose the studio around 150 million dollars. A clear sign by the audience: give us quality and we're there. Give as a big pile of trash and we won't show up.NOW is the time to recalibrate. Less is more. Give the projects time. The future will show if this will remain only a chink in the once-impervious armor of the MCU - or if the biggest franchise of all time is about to have it's big downfall.Deadpool 3 has the chance to bring back No Way Home-like quality and with that hype and excitement. I sincerely hope that will be the case.",
    "13": "Brie was the worst hire of the MCU. Just not a good fit when it came out. And true to current Disney form, instead of changing gears to a more enjoyable character/actor, ya gotta lean into what people are saying isn't working. I had low expectations for this movie and it didn't disappoint. Just cheesy. Watching it, it felt like the actors were as uncomfortable as the rest of us.The cats were good.I have given up on anything that comes out of this studio (MCU/Star Wars/Disney). This is coming from a past huge nerdy fan. The assumption is everything new will be trash.Prove me wrong Disney. Please.",
    "14": "\"The Marvels,\" the latest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, unfortunately, stands as a disappointing chapter in the franchise's history. Despite the exciting prospect of bringing together characters like Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau, and Kamala Khan, the film struggles to weave their stories into a coherent narrative. The script, attempting to juggle multiple character arcs and connections to the larger MCU, ends up feeling cluttered and rushed. The emotional depth and character development suffer amid a flurry of action sequences that, while visually ambitious, lack substance. The film's use of special effects, especially in key sequences, is notably subpar, detracting from the overall experience. Individual performances from the cast bring some charm, but they're hindered by the disjointed storyline and lackluster dialogue. Ultimately, \"The Marvels\" falls short of the high expectations set by its predecessors, offering a forgettable and underwhelming experience. 2/10.",
    "15": "This was a story made in order not to lose the rights to the characters. It had to be. Since when is Kamala Quasar? The Skrulls have a home? Why make Secret Invasion? That should have been called Fury. That's what I feel after watching this. Nick went from the confident spy to a sniveling old man. Who hated Sam Jackson enough to write the character this way? There's a musical in the second act AND a new Disney Princess.Smh.The pacing in the movie is horrible as is the fact that the hero of the film has absolutely no problem putting a child in danger, doing so deliberately multiple times throughout.Monica was a simp who suddenly knew how to control her powers after two days together with Carol and Kamala? Kamala is a ninja all of a sudden? This was Marvel's version of WW84.",
    "16": "1. The villain is written very poorly and is mostly there because of the plot points which they want to show in the movie instead of the organic growth which you would expect. The villain was very shallow and her acting was very sub-standard compared to Thanos, Ronan, High Evolutionary and even Hela. She laked scene presence and fear factor was lacking.2. Monica Rambeau character is really like a side supporting character whose job is to say the lines so that the conversation can move forward and the audience know that the scene is going to end. In the whole movie she was always coming up with the solution without showing how she figured it out. Maybe these scenes were cut from the final draft.3. Nick Fury is a shadow of himself and is no longer the guy with the plan. Instead he is just there to reassure others and to always tell the stakes and to beg for help. This all makes him like he's not worthy of the status he's been given and is more like a poser.4. The cats subplot and the singing planet subplot was very cringe for most of the fans in my cinema and they could have added some different stories instead which could have showed more engaging dialogues, scheming etc.5. Carol Danvers was better in this one than Captain marvel movie still she is still acting like this lone ranger with so many plot holes in her story which no body knows about like where has she been all these years, Does she have any other friends or any other stories or battles which she was busy with in the past years. She could not show more about her character, her motivation which was a shame. She stills feels alot forced than organic.6. Ms. Marvel was better than her 2 other co stars and did show more of her motivation and character but still at time she was too annoying, behaving like a child without any concerns for the situation that she was in. She should have acted more like how Peter was in Infinity War, like how he was fearful but was trying to act brave for Tony but you could see that he was scared himself and you could see that he wanted leadership from Tony and Dr. Strange and was following along their orders which was much more believable. In The Marvels it was lacking and Ms. Marvel was acting like nothing serious is going on and that everything will be fine and that she's confident.Overall, the movie did not deliver and the overall story is forgetful and very isolated as well.",
    "17": "\"Higher.. Further.. Faster..\"With Loki Season 2 having its finale this week, it kinda feels like a back to back Marvel treat for fans with the release of The Marvels, the sequel to 2019's Captain Marvel.No hate, but here's my review (SPOILERS ahead - well sort of)The Marvels brings back our cosmic heroes Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan where the three faces quite a problem with the use of their powers but along that, they will also face a not so much of a threat villain who's purpose is to destroy planets that Danvers dear hold in order to save a dying planet - so yeah typical revenge story. During the course of the movie, things were explained why Monica feel off towards Danvers, what was she doing after the events of Wandavision as well as the whereabouts of Danvers, the life of Fury in space, Kamala just living her \"not so\" ordinary life and some side quests such as visiting different planets, the Flerken family and how the three will use their powers despite the power switch that they were experiencing.-Technically, the story is fast paced with new characters that I am not so sure if we will be able to remember after this film. But all in all, it is an enjoyable and entertaining film.As for the character development of the three main, it was good. Good seeing them interact and I agree that Kamala felt like she was the heart of this film. She was able to connect to both Danvers and Monica and strengthen their bond. Danvers' character also felt more established here compared to her previous Marvel films however it kind of felt like she was depowered here but that was explained and showed in the film.And finally, as for the \"fan service\" of this film, it was bananas! Though I was spoiled days before watching the film, it was still good seeing it in the actual film.All I can say, The Marvels felt more like a \"filler\" or a preparation / setup to what has to come in the future of Marvel Cinematic Universe. The post credits scene(s) are the bridge to the future of MCU. It was a sweet setup but I hope they won't screw this up. Don't ruin the hype Marvel and fans alike.This is one of those \"decent - entertaining\" recent MCU films.The Marvels is a 7/10 for me. I really did enjoy it but as a quality film? See it for yourself. But as for the experience, this was 9/10. One of my best cinema experience (show in another post)The real MVP was Goose.",
    "18": "They literally made a Marvel movie with 3 characters nobody cares about. No wonder this ended up being the lowest performing movie at the box office in the history of the MCU. This movie was pushed back multiple times and got delayed from being released several times, and now we can see why. The plot for this film was weird & sloppy & nonsensical, the action scenes were even worse, and almost all the actors are phoning it in with the exception of Iman Vellani who plays Ms Marvel. She's the only character who has any personality whatsoever in this film, but she's not enough of a reason to go see this film in theaters. Do yourself a favor & just watch this on Disney+ in a couple months, this film is not worth the cost of a movie ticket.",
    "19": "This feels like such a superhero movie. Like oldschool. You know when superheroes were too nerdy for the general population and they felt a bit weird? That what this feels like. I get that that means a lot of people will be disappointed. If you expect too much you will not like this movie.However if you wanna be entertained by three charismatic leads than this is the movie for you. Its just lighthearted fun. The shorter runtime also means that for once you do not feel overwhelmed while watching. It also means you probably won't be talking about this movie for months. But it was worth it watching it at the theater and i will definitly rewatch it again if i wanna have a good 105 minutes of entertainment. Expectation is really everything with this movie. Not everything needs to be a masterpiece sometimes its enough to make viewers smile and laugh and not think too hard.",

It's like they didn't even try this time. How did a civil war equate to the sun dying? Don't know. How are all the people still alive with no sun, air, or water? Don't know. Why it took all that time for Capt. Marvel to figure out she could fix the problem SHE created? Don't know. Why did the Flurkens suddenly start to lay eggs everywhere? Don't know. Why are they surprised this is the largest MCU BOMB of all time? Don't know.",

Nick Furry is caricature of what we're used to. Captain Marvel is a joke of what she's capable to do. The cats and the FX are so bad. It's like I was watching a Disney channel kids show. Bad jokes, no emotions, only a teenager who can't stop screaming of excitement . This movie is a joke. Why do they even bother to release it to the theater? I'm sad, because I like Captain Marvel, but it has been undermined since the beginning. The most powerful Marvel superhero is just a joke in this movie as well as everything else.

Logic is totally absent. Directing, acting? I am struggling to remember a movie worse than this. Music score, especially a tune from Cats don't correspond to what is seen on the screen. Just wondering who is writing these positive reviews. Don't believe them. Save you time and money.",

Iman/Kamala/Ms. Marvel was in Ms. Marvel and Teyonah/Monica Rambeau/Spectrum was in WandaVision. It's written & directed by Nia DaCosta who also directed Candyman_2021.

Zawe is a Kree that survives and gets her hands on a Cosmic Bangle-looks like an arm bracelet-and she then goes seeking revenge on Brie. When Zawe uses the bangle, it causes Brie, Teyonah and Iman to switch places with each other when they use their powers. Samuel returns as Nick Fury-he must have it in his contract to be in any Marvel movie.

It was chaotic, jumbled, and arbitrary; assumed way more knowledge of backstory than reasonable; tried too hard for unearned sentiment; and featured a wooden performance from nominal star Brie Larson. It was not redeemed by its one brilliant touch, the use of the song \"Memory\" during the main hypercat scenes.I know that superhero stories are nominally science fiction, because they're supposed to portray things that could really happen in the real world, without use of magic or divinity, if we're willing to grant them a couple of wild cards, such as the assumption that we've been able to figure out faster-than-light travel.

The Marvels addresses both of these problems. And it works.Are there problems? Of course there are. But it's not all over the place. It's actually quite focused.And the best of all, it sets up the future of the Marvel Universe at the very end of the film as well as the mid credit scene. And it's wonderful. The future of the MCU is going to be great.",

Maybe those who haven't seen any marvel movies and are under 5 might like it. But if you're over 6 you'll hate it. I can't stress enough it just shows the creative juice in Disney is gone\nNo interesting characters and have no idea what this was about. Not to mention you can predict every line just sloppy lazy movie making.",
    "50": "I have no idea what happened to this franchise. To think this is the same studio that brought us Iron Man, Avengers and Infinity War.The story of the Marvels is an absolute mess. Its all based around a body swapping mechanic triggered by using their powers, which seemed more like an idea included just for the action scenes. They then proceed to forget about it whenever they need them to use their powers but its inconvenient for them to swap. They also never explain why they started swapping places in the first place. Even when the effect wears off they have no idea why or how it happened, and they dont try to explain anything more about it then either. Its just dropped for the rest of the film as if it never happened.The villain could have also been the worst Marvel villain we've ever had. Her acting was absolutely terrible. I genuinely laughed out loud on multiple occasions. She had paper thin motivation, no character traits whatsoever and looked ridiculous doing anything in her costume. She also has Ronins hammer for some reason and its left completely unexplained and ignored. Seems like that happened with a lot of things though, no doubt a side effect from the ridiculous amount of reshoots they've done.The 3 lead actors do a fairly decent job with the material theyre given. However there is only so much you can do. Carol is slightly more likeable than she was in the first film (which wasnt very much) but she still isnt given much in the way of character development. Monica is also there, but also doesnt get much to do. Oh ye and she learns to fly because Nick Fury shouts \"black girl magic\" at her (im not even kidding). She can also pass through solid objects, shoot laser beams from her hands and can close tears in space time apparently.The best part of the film by far is Ms. Marvel. The actress is likeable, she tells the only jokes that land in the film and she has some nice moments with family members. But they are way too few and far between, scattered between random action, painfully boring villain dialogue, nonsense filler in the form of a musical planet (dont even ask), and a side story near the end about a bunch of cats that can teleport people to other dimensions. Because what everyone wanted more of after seeing captain marvel was cats.This is a terrible mess, which is not surprising after all the studio meddling. If you care about good storytelling, good characters or even the MCU in general, I'd stay away from this one. Though I find myself saying that more and more these days.",
    "51": "There is one question that I have never found a reasonable answer to it. Imagine someone prepares a lot of food and drinks and arranges a very nice decoration. And when he was asked \"what is the reason of this party and who are going to come?\" and he replied, \"no reason, and nobody!\" Now back to the movie business, when there is no script or story line, what is the reason for the big budget and preparation? This Marvels is just satire of Captain Marvel. Just a quick look at its cheap comedy. And just imagine there are dancing and singing in the Marvel Universe.in the scene of cats I would not be surprised if I see Garfield in that between.",
    "52": "It seems like a long time ago that Marvel reached its high point with The Avengers: Endgame.Since then both the movies and television shows have disappointed more often than not.There have been too many creative cul de sacs and some of the movies have been overlong mess.The Marvels clock in with a thankfully shorter running time. It still somehow manages to have an incoherent plot.Kamala Khan/Ms Marvel (Iman Vellani) gets zapped out off her New Jersey home to find herself somewhere in space. While Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) finds herself staring at Kamala Khan's puzzled parents.Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) whose mother was a close friend of Carol Danvers. Teams up with the other two Marvels to take on Kree warrior Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) who blames Captain Marvel for destroying their sun.Some of the quirky bits worked well. The fight scenes are a chore, Captain Marvel is just too powerful for the villains. It is entertaining in an undemanding way.At least it showcases Ms Marvel who featured in one of the better Disney streaming superhero shows.",
    "53": "Whats happening here!? I used to at least be able to end a Marvel movie. This one I just walked out, I'm done.As a HUGE Nick Fury fan. Nick Fury is supposed to be the best spy, the one who protects everything.......with some questionable tactics and sacrifices.The MCU Nick Fury is a useless old man, a weak coward who is used for comic relief. Instead we get 3 incompetent 'heroes' with ZERO personal/character growth. And yet another forgettable villain no one cares about.I guess the effects are good enough, the actors do the most with what little they get. It's just a useless story, with useless heroes, useless villains, in a useless universe, setting up new useless stories.",
    "54": "Get your \"unhelpful\" button presses ready because, whilst it's not without a couple of issues, I enjoyed \"The Marvels\" quite a bit.Whilst investigating an anomaly in deep space, Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) inexplicable swaps places with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) who is working on the space platform in low orbit and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani) who is at her family home in New Jersey. With the trio wildly leaping between locations, they learn that Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) the new leader of the Kree has the other quantum band and is using the power of it to tear holes in space time. When the three heroes get together, they try and learn about why they are switching and whether they can get on the same page enough to stop Dar-Benn.I will say that this might be the film that crossed the threshold for people who haven't religiously watched the entirety of the MCU output so far. Whilst it does briefly cover these salient events, you really need to have seen \"Captain Marvel\", as well as the \"Wandavision\" and \"Ms. Marvel\" TV series to actually know who our three leads are. There's a cameo of a character with even less explanation if you've not seen the last two \"Thor\" movies. Whilst I'm doing the criticisms, I think that the planet where the inhabitants communicate through song was better in idea than it was execution and, whilst I love Zawe Ashton, and she's fine here (with Daniel Ings as another British comedy actor in a key role), we've seen a lot of 'justified' villains recently and her outcome was a bit underwhelming.As I say though, I enjoyed the film. I am that man that's eagerly devouring the MCU projects whenever they come out and so did know who everyone was - and was happy to see many of them again. I love Kamala's family in the series and I'm happy they get so much play here. Iman Vellani remains the most charming actress and is delightful throughout this and I thought that the chemistry between the three leads was excellent. The comedy is mostly pushed it he direction of Nick Fury, and his B-Story about trying to save the SABRE space station and I though it worked, including the \"Memories\" scene. It doesn't suffer from any of the visual effects issues that the MCU has suffered from recently and I thought, just to counter the criticism that I've seen about this online, that the plot was easy to follow.I certainly enjoyed this more that \"Love and Thunder\" or \"Quantumania\" and I don't think, even if it proves to be the worst performing film at the box office, it deserves to be lumped in with them.",
    "55": "Even compared to the latest series of marvel movies, this film's plot is paper thin. Body switching, revenge villain. All have been done countless times before and far better than this.If you havent seen the Ms Marvel TV show then the slap stick and comedy Kamala family issues that cloud over many scenes are highly annoying and will throw you off. The cast of that show are back and just as silly as they are through out that show. It even goes into the semi obligatory training montage part way through.Like many others out there I had no expectations of anything of quality from Marvel. Yet I was disappointed with how thin this was. Typical Hollywood has to have a Brit as the villain. Zawe Ashton does what she can with the material she's given. She gives a far superior performance with it than Larson bothers with hers.The cats chasing the crew around the station to \"Memory\" from \"Cats\" is the best scene in the whole film which is sad given the end of the universe plot. Then again both DC and Marvel seem to forget their source content material when it comes to making films. How bad would \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" or \"Saw\" be if it was a PG-13 movie? Yet what does DC attempt to do, when all their material including the action sections is that dark? Marvel strips out that dark level drama out of their material to make their movies so they end up hollow.",
    "56": "I can't blame actors because they are doing what they have told to do. I blame Disney execs, director, and writers for such fiasco. Since Disney bought Marvel, this franchise have lost their north.If I would like to see a musical, I choose any Princess movie. Why????? Why a musical part in this movie??? Why???? Doesn't make any sense at all!!!!! Why Nick Fury is making stupid jokes like Thor in Love and Thunder????? Why the movie should be childish instead of teaching Ms. Marvel the dangers that will be facing for real in outer space??? \"The bad girl\" inspired no fear at all and she had poor dialog like the rest of the cast.Don't waste money or time or even data.",
    "57": "As a decades long Marvel fan I hate admitting it, but this may have been the nail in the coffin for them, at least for making movies. Me and several friends just finished Loki and were all amazed on how well done it was and agreed it's among the top 5 cinematics Marvel has ever released. We hoped Marvels was going to continue that experience and connect those awesome plot lines, but it failed on every level. We almost walked out less than halfway through because of how bad it actually was. Don't understand why they dumbed it down so much, and desperately used cats and musicals to try to connect to teens. They ruined a great opportunity for a timeless memorable movie with an all female cast of heros, and instead doomed them to be a part of history when Marvel officially lost its way. Heartbreaking, and unfortunately made me and many real fans lose hope for the next few movies and the MCU as a whole...",
    "58": "The strongest part of the movie is the chemistry between the three lead actresses, with Iman Velani (Kamala Khan) certainly being the best of the three. You're just seeing a real childish reaction that most likely anyone would have if something like this happened to them. I would compare it to Peter Parker in \"Captain America: Civil War\". Carol is cool, but she should have been more than that. Monica had the potential to be developed as a much more important character after \"WandaVision\", and here she felt a bit like a \"third wheel\". Fury and Kamala's family are very good supporting characters and funny ones at that. I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh with them, but speaking of laughs, the other strength of the movie is precisely that it's funny. If you're looking for something to let loose without straining too much, the movie is perfect, if you're looking for something more, watch some other MCU movie. There are also silly moments, some will like it, others won't, not others will like it anyway.The villain is forgettable and exactly 1 day after the movie, no one will remember her name, if anyone knew it before. It's Dar-Benn. Apart from being the budget Ronan, it doesn't leave you anything else. I don't think the problem is with the actress so much as with what she was given as a script.The story and overall the whole scenario is nothing special. The premise is interesting, but it feels like we're watching \"Captain Marvel 3\" before we've seen \"Captain Marvel 2.\" Some important things have happened that we only mention and spend about two minutes on. Definitely some 15-20 minutes would be useful at the expense of 10 minutes on a planet that communicates by singing. Not that I particularly minded it, but how should I put it...priorities?The effects are \"questionable\", in some places they were good, in others they needed more finishing touches. The best fight choreography of the film was at the very beginning. The final battle was okay, but the truth is, it's not something that will go down in MCU history as some great moment. I'll give an example, if I tell someone \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\", absolutely everyone thinks of the fight between Steve and Bucky on the road with the knife that fell between their hands while they were fighting and it's a practical fight, without the need for many effects . Just great choreography. There was no such thing in \"The Marvels\".The main musical score was nice.The final scene of the movie, as well as the credit scene, will actually ignite more discussions than the film itself. Both are important as they tease things that are becoming more and more important in the current phase of the Marvel universe.Clearly, the pandemic negatively affected this movie as well, but in a different reality, if \"WandaVision\" and \"Ms. Marvel\" had came out within one calendar year and \"The Marvels\" had come out at the beginning of the next, 2020 vs. 2021 respectively, the movie would have excite more people to watch it. If you haven't seen the Disney+ shows, you will understand the movie, but if you have, you will be pleasantly rewarded by understanding more things.In general, I can sum up \"The Marvels\" as a fun little quest in the MCU that beats a few important events, brings together three closely related characters and leads us to something much more interesting than the movie we just saw. Top 10 MCU Movie? Not a chance. The weakest MCU movie? I would not say.",
    "59": "With all the negative reviews surrounding this project, it actually made me want to see how bad it could be. Or I'd either be in for a nice surprise and the critics were wrong. (this is rare territory for Disney and Marvel to have such a polarising film even before its released).I'll be honest my expectations were low and yep this film is pretty terrible! I have only one/two good things to say about the film. Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson are of course still trying to save this film and I do feel sorry for them, that they are in this horrendous product. I'll be honest I actually was in the minority and really really enjoyed \"Captain Marvel\". Still to this day I stand behind that statement and view, I do think its very good. I'm also in the extreme minority who actually don't get the hate for Brie Larson, she is a perfectly fine actress and does well in the role.Her performance along with Jackson's might be the only two things of any note that are half decent.The rest of it is a mix of boring, bland story telling along with some mindnumpingly stupid decisions taken with this film. I am still in shock how they thought turning it into a musical for a brief time would be a good idea? Like what had the writers and director been sniffing to come up with that?? I want it permanently erased from my memory!The villain.........erm I have no idea where to begin with that......erm weak doesn't feel good enough descriptor but I can't think of anything else. Its sad and shocking this was the best they could come up with.Forgettable story, villain, tbh the whole film is extremely forgettable and stupid.I'll leave it at that because I really don't like writing negative reviews. We have to remember there are hundreds of people behind the scenes of films that do work very hard to produce something good, its not always the case that it comes out well.20% out of 100 its terrible, you can watch it and laugh or cover your eyes in horror.PS - Forgot one minor sort of good thing, the cat eating the crew gag, made me slightly laugh! I know shocker, however I'm biased because I like cats. Oh and also, wow X-Men tease at the end, like we really needed that?",
    "60": "This is your one and only chance to evacuate Kevin Feige.Whoever thought that 105 minutes is enough time for a tight and crisp sequel should wear the quantum bands and fragment --- it's almost like we're skipping scenes for the sake of time. In one shot we see the villain's aircrafts arrive at the musical planet, the next shot soldiers are marching into city. Like is there no aerial defense? And how does the villain know where to go? In fact, the entire segment with the musical planet is the dictionary definition of cringe, whether Brie Larson's lip syncing or the Marvels suddenly running off in the end, basically leaving the planet and the legal husband to be conquered and sucked dry. Also, hammer lady's purpose is so out-of-date she would be a great villain in Phase Two --- air, water, fire, does she think herself Avatar the last freaking airbender? If Captain Marvel isn't scripted to have to babysit two side kicks and be questioned why she can't be everywhere all the time by Ms. WiFi Spectrum or whatever, she would disintegrate hammer lady in their first encounter. Finally there is the post-credit scene: are we for real? If we are to officially introduce the Beast, can we at least make him not so visibly CGIed? And then we have Mama Rambeau; she's dead in one universe, Captain Marvel in another, now what is she and what the flip is her costume? Captain Hashtag? Tictactoe Woman?",
    "61": "I was basically given little choice but to see this movie at the theatre due to Disney discontinuing the release of any movies/TV shows on DVD/Blu-ray where I am (not to mention Doctor Who, which they now own, will no longer screen on free-to-air TV for the first time since it began here. Thanks a BUNCH, Disney!). I refuse to basically be bullied into getting Disney+, and consequently have missed out on ALL the Marvel shows. So when the first trailer for this movie made it seem like 'The Ms. Marvel & Photon Movie (guest-starring Captain Marvel)', I wasn't overly enthused since it was Carol/Captain Marvel who I wanted to see more of (after actually having *liked* her first film...'unpopular' as that opinion may be), whereas I knew nothing about these other two.The movie begins with Kree warrior, Dar-Benn (sorry, SUPREMOR Dar-Benn), digging up an all-powerful bangle (someone really needs to round up all these powerful magical items in the universe and hide/destroy them so villains can't keep getting their mitts on them), while the other one is in the possession of Captain Marvel fangirl, Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (just as well I'd at least seen the trailers for her TV show via YouTube and thus was prepared, otherwise I probably would've been wondering WTF was up with the animated daydream sequence). Meanwhile, Carol's living a pretty solitary life in space (with only that scene-stealing Flerken, Goose, as company), though she can at least communicate with Fury. For those who felt Carol was 'too serious'/'lacked personality' previously (give her a break, she had AMNESIA!), she seems to have more life in her now and her dynamic/friendship with Fury remains as entertaining as ever...that is until she sticks her hand in some \"mysterious glowing sh#t\", then he becomes none-too-pleased with her.Though she's not the only one, as Kamala and Monica Rambeau (daughter of Carol's old friend, Maria) make the same mistake, causing all three to unintentionally switch places whenever they use their powers...making for something 'different' with the fight scenes to what we've seen before, as the characters are constantly doing swapsies whilst fighting bad guys, trashing Kamala's house as a result (on the upside, she eventually gets to meet her hero and fangirls out, apologising for the copyright infringement on the Captain Marvel name with her self-appointed 'Ms. Marvel' and determined to give Monica a superhero name too). Once the three 'Marvels' come together, it's fun seeing them interact and the different dynamics they have. There's the uncomfortable tension between Carol and Monica (who's mad at Carol for not being there to support her following the death of her mum, Maria. Um...she was busy SAVING THE UNIVERSE, cut her some slack!), while Kamala learns to tone down her hero-worship of Captain Marvel, after witnessing Carol making the tough decision to abandon some Skrulls (rescuing the ones she can) after Dar-Benn's attack.It's not easy being Carol, who gets blamed for EVERYTHING, is met with suspicion/hostility by Kamala's family (who I understand being concerned for Kamala, given her age/the fact she's involved in stuff that could get her KILLED, but they seem fine with Monica, whilst resenting Carol, and they wear a bit thin after a while), and although Carol's the one to defeat Dar-Benn, it's Monica who gets the 'big hero moment' at the end, closing the hole to another reality that Dar-Benn ripped in space. It almost feels like Monica's the lead, while Carol's just there to support her. Eventually Monica learns the real reason Carol wasn't around (after destroying the Supreme Intelligence, which had unintended consequences that led to Dar-Benn's planet dying and now she's stealing resources from other planets to save hers, Carol felt too ashamed to return) and forgives her 'aunt'. Still, the last scene of the movie (mid-credits) is all about Monica reuniting with her mum from the other reality she gets trapped in (Kelsey Grammer also makes a cameo as Beast, looking better/more Beast-like than he did in his previous appearances) and so this Captain Marvel sequel's ending isn't even *about* Captain Marvel.I waited around for a post-credits scene, but was just met with a blank screen and what sounded like a Flerken barfing up something. Speaking of, Goose once again proves to be the TRUE hero by hatching a litter of Flerken kittens whose ability to swallow not just objects, but people as well (whilst keeping them ALIVE), proves crucial...though too bad this wasn't thought of when the Skrulls needed rescuing. As previously mentioned, Brie Larson's much more 'livelier' in her performance this go-around (though she also gets some decent emotional/dramatic moments), this was my introduction to both Teyonah Parris's Monica (who spent the majority of her time spouting technobabble/science gibberish and I wasn't that fussed on until after she forgave Carol, then she got more likeable) and Iman Vellani's Kamala (who's entertaining, even if she overdoes the screaming/\"Oh my God!\" exclamations a bit...though at least it's warranted when she sees what Goose can do for the first time) and I appreciated the montage of the trio teaching themselves how to work with the whole swapping-places-whilst-using-their-powers thing.Zawe Ashton as Dar-Benn (who's much more fetching than her Smurf predecessor) did what she could playing yet another MCU villain who's doing BAD things for what is, in their mind, 'the right reasons', but when the 'Marvels' show her mercy/try to do her a solid, she threatens Kamala's life, then goes all kamikaze (what is it with Accusers exploding? First Ronan, now her...find another way to die!). It's a shame that test audiences apparently didn't respond well to an extended sequence on a planet populated by people who communicate through song (I imagine it got trimmed), as it was actually one of the movie's more memorable/fun scenes. I personally feel the OTT hate for this film is unwarranted, as it actually wasn't as bad as I'd feared (and with a ringing endorsement like THAT, how can you *not* want to watch it?).",
    "62": "Carol Danvers is attempting to save the universe, but her incredible powers become entangled with those of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau, they must unite to save the world.Ouch, what can you say, this is surely one of Marvel's lowest points, I honestly don't know who the target audience is, or who this is going to appeal to, young teens only maybe? Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10.",
    "63": "The MCU has absolutely overstayed its welcome. Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame.",
    "64": "I just want to know who is responsible for MCUs phase 4 and how he or she can still be employedThere are 0(zero) good movies and only 1 or 2 tv shows that are watchable over a total of 20 productions and this is one of the bottom ranked ones. Marvel did a fantastic job over the decade, earned trust of fans besides billions of dollars and they are wasting it like there is no tomorrow.I don't know how a franchise can change so drastically from hero to zero.I have watched every marvel movie out there and this is equally as bad as she-hulk.Story is definitely boring, protagonists are boring, antagonist is boring, action is boring, battles are boring, some scenes are absurd and ridiculous.I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. Don't waste your money or your time.Looks like the movie is only made to make money in India.",
    "65": "This second installment makes the original Captain Marvel look like a cinematic masterpiece... Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline.",
    "66": "Marvel movies really have fallen apart haven't they? This is definitely one of the worst Marvels movie I have seen out of all the Marvel movies I had watched. There really isn't too much to say about the movie because \"The Marvels\" is pretty much like almost every single Marvel movie but the writing, humor, direction, and performances are pretty much all over the place. Director Nia DaCosta has made \"Little Woods\" which I liked but her direction here is pretty bad and goes all over the place.The special effects are kind of rough on the edges, the actions and thrills were just okay and the performances, despite a pretty good cast, they aren't very good. Brie Larson is an actress I like but unfortunately her performance felt weak and lacking. The other performances as well including the child performances. The story isn't interesting as the writing is pretty bland and none of the characters were interesting. With a short runtime, the movie surprisingly was really boring.I do like superhero movies but it seems this one really just sucked. Overall, it's bad.",
    "67": "Going from the Loki Series Finale this morning to The Marvels this evening was (for lack of a better word) bonkers! The finale was perfect, and a beautiful ending to the show, while The Marvels is a complete mess. It's honestly given me whiplashThe Marvels is just an all-around bad movie. The script is awful and the story is super rushed and poorly executed, which both have an impact on how well the characters (and in-turn the actors) come-across on-screenThe action and humour are kind of alright, and the VFX are definitely better than anything we've seen in an MCU project since Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (with the obvious exceptions of Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 and Loki Season 2), but that still doesn't exactly make it look greatThis movie is just painful to watch at points! Early on, it has some really fun moments, and felt like it could have actually been somewhat entertaining, but that feeling vanished as soon as it came. It's barley better than Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania, so you can do with that information what you will.",
    "68": "My wife and I recently caught Marvel's (2023) in theaters. The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience.",
    "69": "Once in a while I tend to go to my local theater to check out something new, maybe a new release or a re-run of a movie. Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought \"Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?\" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this.",
    "70": "THE MARVELS is here and it's a mashed up film that is totally all over the place. It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10.",
    "71": "I actually had no intention of watching this film in theaters. Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10\nLetterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.",

With their powers interlinked, forcing them to keep switching into each other, how the trio manage to stop Dar-Benn forms rest of the story.The existing problem of MCU continues with The Marvels as well where we once again get a pointless addition to the franchise, whose sole purpose is to reveal that post credit scene. With a weak villain and an extremely powerful lead i.e. Captain Marvel who gets to team up with two others, no matter how much the stakes are raised, it never feels like a challenge to the mighty superhero. Instead the focus is on the teen humor.The best thing about The Marvels is it's short runtime. The humor not always work as intended though some of the jokes did work to an extent. The emotions too were on the surface level only. The reunion honestly should've been dealt better. Resorting to solving the high stakes problem in a simpler way or even randomly figuring out the solution, failed to register. On paper, it wasn't a terrible idea but when you have Captain Marvel, it is mandatory to give her a strong villain and a better story she deserves. Otherwise, there is only so much Kamala Khan can do with her jokes.",
    "73": "When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls' singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the \"Paul is dead\" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, \"The Marvels\" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like \"Wakanda Forever\" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that.",
    "74": "Strangely the best thing in this movie was Kamala Khan character first introduced in a pretty terrible D+ show nobody watched.Every single other thing in this movie was terrible.Captain Marvel was someone nobody wanted to see on screen again, and Bree Larson remains unable to act. She tries on her acting and drama and humour pants and found they didn't fit, so she just fumbles around and does a poor job.Rambo was introduced as an apologist for slavery and torture, got some kind of turning intangible thing going on which she got by walking for some reason, in a D+ show so she's probably new to most people.The bad guy was pathetic, the plan she sort of vaguely has, something to do with stealing an atmosphere for some reason to do something for some reason that wasn't made clear, to finish the plan of somebody but she doesn't say who that was, or what their plan was, and she is not in any way threatening. Her acting sucked also.The whole premise was idiotic. It could have been interesting if they had some kind of plan or plot before filming started instead of trying to fix it in post production, so what we got was sometimes three characters (one who fires light stuff, one who makes glowing purple stuff, and one who can apparently see light so she claimed in the script that her power is to not be blind) who sometimes switch places when they use their powers, but sometimes they don't.It's extremely inconsistent and only happens when convenient for the 'plot' or when some script writer with no sense of humour thinks it would be funny.Then lasers and flying around and fight scenes and some very sketchy CGI.And that's it. I tuned out for most of it, got bored after a while and so I can't remember most of what happened so I'll find out from a future Pitch Meeting who will do a much better job explaining the film than my semi-coherent rambling.",
    "75": "I don't follow the Internet fir all of the news about trouble production and reshoots etc...Bur when I saw the first trailer of The Marvels I had absolutely no desire to see it. Trailers usually are put together by marketing to make a film look as good as possible but I think in the case of this film they could not hide how utterly awful this film would be. I don't believe in criticizing a film if I do r see it so I went expecting the worst with the desire to at least be entertained. This was the worst 105 minutes I have spent in a movie theater in a long time. The MCU has gone from being a franchise that had so e great films but mostly solid, reliable and memorable films. Since Avengers: Endgame, only with a couple of exceptions, the MCU has gone completely downhill. With every film, they feel so generic, so done without the care that used to be made them so popular. Now, the difference is like night and day. They have become aggressively lazy and average films. Forgettable. But none of them had been complete failures on every level until The Marvels.There really is no story to talk about here. It is a sequel to Captain Marvel that i admit is one of the pre-Endgame films I liked the least. I didn't think Brie Larson was particularly bad as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel but there was nothing special about her in the role. Here it's obvious she wasn't right for the role. She has no charisma as the character, it felt like she was phoning in the performance. In fact that is the case for everyone in this film. It's a phoned in film. There is not a single character or situation to care about. A villain that is probably the worst ever in the MCU. It's just a series of mediocre action scenes put together with so e exposition dialogue thrown in to pad the runtime. At 105 mi it's it's short by MCU standards but it felt like 3 hours!!!Hands down, the worst MCU film ever!!!Grade: F.",
    "76": "That changed today. Forget about \"worst Marvel movie ever,\" it clears that hurdle by leagues. No, this is a contender for the worst mega budget, big studio, theatrically released film ever made. The tone veers from painfully unfunny attempts at slapstick humor to terribly acted \"this is most serious threat the world has ever faced\" moments that aim for gravitas but miss by miles, and sometimes these ridiculous tonal shifts occur in the same scene. Nothing makes sense, NOTHING. And that's the first 45 minutes before I had enough and left the theater and demanded a refund. I can't believe this script got a greenlight, let alone a $300 million budget. Speaking of which, where on this earth did all that money go? It certainly is not up on the screen as this is some of the worst CGI I have ever seen. Movies made in the 90s look a thousand times better than this catastrophe. I keep reading articles about why this movie is going to fail and they all got it wrong; three incomprehensibly unlikable leads, a nonsensical script, and a woefully incompetent director are why this movie is such a failure. The reviews that say this film is bad are wrong, but it's not the critic's fault; it's just that human language hasn't evolved a word strong enough to describe just how awful it truly is. I can still smell the stink of it on my clothes.",
    "77": "Hey, remember Thor 2 Dark world? A 272 million dollar movie where nothing much happened? A bland filler for one infinity stone and Loki getting away from Thor? Still made 644 million. And nobody cared anymore that Heimdall was raceswapped in the last movie because the actor did a fine job?The Marvels was made on the same amount of money, and cant even break even. And feels even more bland than eating boiled potatostarch. Not cornstarch that has actual corn flavor. Boiled potato starch. The poor mans glue to tie stuff together. That is this movie.Kamala Khan feels downgraded from her own TV series.Monica Rambeau is just there because early 80s comics. A fifth wheel that does nothing beyond having the power to fix a dimensional plot hole in the end.The villain is forgettable.Nick Fury retired to play Starfield, bugs and all. Didn't even tell anyone about Tarnax skrull refugee planet.The only thing that could have saved this movie was going all the way into turning Captain Marvel into a villain, since her gunho path of destruction keeps making things worse around the galaxy.What has Marvel Cinematic Univers actually gain from this? What phase 5 story narrative did it run? Nothing. Only subtractions and fails.Write better stories.",
    "78": "The titular trio are forced to work together due to glorious comic book contrivance.The chemistry is great, and Iman Vellani is bubbling with an infectious enthusiasm. Both of the other two feel mishandled and don't deliver performances as strong as we know they are able to. The action scenes feel largely inserted rather than organic, though some do get creative and fun, such as the use of body swapping. The comedy is not as funny as that of the two Disney+ shows it follows up on - not by a long shot. The cinematography and editing have some inspired moments, especially in a few montages, one of which made me laugh harder than I have in a very long time, and is otherwise mired in the restrictive house style.This is a great feminist piece, though it is not up to the standard of the Birds of Prey film, or ones like The Babadook and 2003's Monster. It is very clear that this movie's three writers, all of them women, made sure to work in as many stereotypically female things as they could, and a lot of the best moments are when this really leans into that. I want to live on the planet where everyone sings instead of talks. There's kittens, double dutch, girls teasing each other about the boyfriend of one of them. I know some men won't like this, though to be clear not everyone who's going to hate this is a misogynist, but, seriously, fellow fellas, we can support the girls getting some representation, especially when it's this good. Where the first Captain Marvel solo pic was very much a typical western(the part of the world *and* the fiction genre) power fantasy of an individual handling things entirely on their own, this features several diverse young women supporting each other, reflecting younger generations' move away from individualism, towards found family and looking out for one another.I recommend this to every fan of the MCU - note that this could be the first one you watch. 7/10.",
    "79": "The Marvels is a solid new entry in the MCU. It's a nice convergence of three different storylines from these three characters. The movie is very fast-paced and flies by. I would even describe some parts as hectic, but in a good way. It never lost me.It has some good action scenes, although nothing that really stands out. The sci-fi candy is delicious. And it made me laugh out loud numerous times, with clever jokes that feel organic rather than forced.The other thing I really enjoyed is a few unique aspects that make it stand out amongst other formulaic superhero movies. One involves power entanglement between the characters. And another involves the jump points (the hexagonal wormholes we've seen in other MCU movies).I had a good time with this movie and would watch it again. It's some enjoyable light-hearted entertainment.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 11/9/2023)",
    "80": "Rating: 3.8\nOverall, a complete mess as the movie does not hit on any angles and there are obvious points where the studio interfered with the cut, bringing into question what the direction of Marvel is going forward.Very Bad Direction (The cut was just very bad and felt like the studio had a major say in how they trimmed it; the macro scenes were just very boring and the fight scenes were not engaging at all as she just relied too much on CGI to make it interesting; the interpersonal scenes were lacking in the movie as it never felt like it furthered the conflict or the relationships between the characters (especially The Marvels as there was like only one scene meant for team building), it felt like there were many scenes for character building that were cut; the direction of actors was very bad because it just felt like none of the cast had any chemistry or felt convincing in the emotional moments of the movie), Bad to Pretty Bad Acting (Bad from Brie Larson (Very Monotonous with her line delivery and just did not carry the movie the way she should've; did not have any chemistry with her castmates), Pretty Bad from Teyonah Parris (Kinda a forgettable performance cause she felt like an aftermath after the other two Marvels), Pretty Bad from Iman Vellani (More of a bad writing issue but felt very forced being the teen archetype for the group (that made it seem more annoying than playful); had some moments where she did shine), Bad from Zawe Ashton (Such a forgettable performance as she was just a generic villain and not convincing at all), Pretty Bad from Samuel L. Jackson (Put like no effort into the performance and just did not feel as good as his other Nick Fury performances (tries to be the comedic relief character and it fails pretty hard)), Bad from the rest of the cast (Just stiff, forced performances all around and no chemistry in any of the scenes)), Very Bad Story (One of the biggest issues for the movie as it felt like the conflict was not conveyed well at all (and was not presented as a big issue), the personal conflict between the characters was also not handled well at all; the story construction was very bad as there practically was no rising action or character developing, the conflict introduction was very poor and not good (and does not feel like a really interesting issue), it felt like a lot of scenes were cut that could've added depth to the movie as there were a lot of cuts in the story to just move the plot forward (but this created a lot of questions); the character writing was bad for the most part as the characters really aren't that interesting at all and their conflicts are not really that compelling (though Ms. Marvel's was the most interesting as it blended the teen-superhero archetype with a South-Asian/American background)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was incredibly cringey and just not good (felt like it was written by someone who read a synopsis of what a Marvel movie should sound like and wrote that as their first screenplay); the jokes were just very forced and not funny at all (the more dramatic elements were funnier with how cringey they were), tried way too hard for Marvel humor and it rarely hits; the South Asian vernacular was just more stereotypical than funny (and as a result just felt very shallow); the symbolism was just so shallow and the message was overt for what they were going for; the foreshadowing was pretty obvious as the movie was very formulaic), Decent Score (felt very similar to other comic book movies)/ Pretty Bad Soundtrack (so on-the-nose that it was laughable), Decent Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound (Similar to other Marvel movies, ADR for the singing was so obvious), Very Bad Editing (Felt super amateur and the cut for the movie was just so bad), Terrible to Very Bad Visual Effects (Felt so cheap and tacky (worse than Thor 4)), Pretty Good Production Design (Similar to other Marvel movies), Pretty Good Makeup, Pretty Good Costumes, Plot Structure was a concern as there were issues with lack of rising action (scenes definitely cut) and the climax was so short that it felt anticlimactic, Pacing was so fast that there was no time to take in what was going on (the runtime could have definitely been added too to add more depth to the story and slow the pace down), Climax was super anticlimactic and like a felt very formulaic Marvel movie, Tone was incredibly Marvel and really tried to go for that teenage Marvel feel during the Ms. Marvel moments (and both did not hit the mark and dragged the movie down by making it formulaic)",

    "82": "This is it folks, the lowest point Marvel Studios has ever sunk to, and after the last 3 years, that is really saying something. This is truly bottom of the barrel stuff.I went into this film with an open mind, despite not being particularly attached to any of these heroes, but it's a total mess. It's borderline incoherent and appears to have been haphazardly stitched together in the editing room like some sort of Frankenstein's monster... and it shows.Brie Larson looks bored and uninterested for much of the film, and Teyonah Parris plays a character nobody cares about like she knows it. The one bright spark is Iman Vellani, who looks like she's genuinely having fun and it shows in her performance. I haven't seen the Ms Marvel show but I might actually give it a watch now. Probably not though.It's sad to see what the MCU has become; a muddled, directionless mess with bad CGI taking the place of good screenplays, tight and clever writing, and likeable characters that you actually care about.Where do they go from here? Who's knows, but I would give this a swerve if I were you.",
    "83": "When it comes to the character of Captain Marvel, the fan base has always seemed to be so negative. I personally have enjoyed Brie Larson's portrayal of the character and enjoyed the first film for the most part. Hearing that her story was shifting to include two other Marvel heroes as co-leads had me raising an eyebrow, but I'm always open to things changing. My biggest concern about The Marvels before seeing it was the fact that two series' on Disney+ seemed to be a prerequisite first. I've been following the entire franchise from start to finish (including the shows), and I really liked the character of Ms. Marvel, so I found myself excited. I can see how viewers who haven't followed the shows would be turned off though, which is a real problem this franchise is facing at the moment. Let's dive deeper, but also review this film on its own, which I did have a good time with.The Marvels picks up after the events of Captain Marvel, Wandavision, and Ms. Marvel. At a mere hour and 45 minutes, the film jumps right into it. The three of them begin to switch places after being exposed to energy. They quickly have to learn to work as a team to stop a looming threat. The Kree are back, led by Dar Benn (Zawe Ashton), and her motivations are all because of a storyline that feels forced to include Captain Marvel and something she did in the past. This was easily the worst part of the film, as I was completely uninterested in it. Her power stems from a Bengal, which Ms. Marvel has the other half of and that was far more interesting. Sadly, the villain as a whole just felt like a device instead of a fleshed-out character. The villain almost hurt the film a little too much for me, but the trio of actresses here was a joy to watch.Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, and Teyonah Parris are absolutely stellar as a trio working together. Their chemistry was so much fun to watch. It's easily the reason I'm giving the villain storyline a pass and saying I enjoyed the movie. The majority of the movie is about them learning to use their powers together and I couldn't get enough of it honestly. On top of that, the integration of Kamala Khan's family was hilarious and used perfectly. I also enjoyed the subtle, quiet moments where they share heart-to-hearts with one another. Certain conversations between Carol and Monica actually had me tearing up. The subtle touches here and there were very nice. The action is surprisingly fun to watch and the CGI didn't stand out as much as it did to me in the first Captain Marvel film, but yes, the elephant in the room here is that this film isn't accessible to everyone, which is a real shame.This is the part that bothers me to even have to mention, but here we go. From Iron Man to Avengers: Endgame, there was always a plan and it was only a couple of movies a year to follow. I'm someone who chooses to follow everything, even if it's good or bad because I would like to see where everything eventually builds to. I can sense another finale in the coming years, but they are simply making far too many projects for the average viewer to follow. I fear that Avengers movies won't even draw the crowds they used to once they finally come out. This frustrates me because the majority of the projects are still good for the most part. It's just that there's too much and far too many characters. This is coming from someone who likes or loves a lot of the newest characters, so I can only imagine how fans who have fallen off the franchise are feeling. Anyways, we're here to discuss The Marvels.In the end, The Marvels is a solid popcorn flick that I sat back and had a good time with. If the cast didn't work so well together and the humour didn't work for me, I would be calling this a lacklustre movie all around. Nia DaCosta definitely pulled the best performances she could out of these actresses and I commend her for that. I also just have to say that the standout of this film is Iman Vellani. I loved her in Ms. Marvel and she shines again here. She's just so happy to be a part of this franchise and it really shows. There are certain scenes that will annoy viewers, but honestly, I recommend this one to fans of the MCU, unless you're someone who already dislikes any of these characters/actresses. Otherwise, it's not great by any means, but I had a good time and I think others will too.",
    "84": "If you have a hard time sleeping, I can recommend this garbage to you.I wanted to leave after only 10-15 minutes but stayed since I went to the cinema with a friend, and didn't want leave him by himself at the cinema.After some time when I saw him with his eyes shut, not because he was sleeping, but because he just couldn't watch any more, I knew it was time to leave.He personally rated the movie as a 2, but I will be so kind and give this thrash a 3 since some of the cgi wasn't all that bad.This might actually be the worst movie I've ever watched in my lifetime, and I've watched quite a lot of bad movies.Recommended for people who has a hard time sleeping. Just bring earplugs, so the singing part doesn't wake you up.",
    "85": "If you can't come up with story which is as good as recent Endgame, Spiderman, Dr Strange then don't come up with something which is as lousy as this.Nothing was right from start to end. Usually the first few minutes is the ideal time to capture the attention of the audience but this movie fails to do that miserably. It was so confusing that I lost interest from the start.By the time you start to acknowledge and make peace with the fact that this is going to be a waste of time but you should just sit back and enjoy the movie and finish your popcorn, you figure out that you have watched dozens of the same predictable plot.Extremely extremely disappointed at myself for eagerly waiting for this movie and suggesting friends to watch the first day first show.Will never ever trust trailers of movies. From now on will wait and watch after reading reviews and ratings.",
    "86": "That's all I can really say about the Marvels it was a good movie. As someone who loves these Marvel movies I am noticing that the magic is wearing down. Nothing about this movie is epic enough to keep me wanting to come back to see it over and over again and I can tell the trill is gone because even the end credit did nothing for me, but as a stand alone movie it was very enjoyable.Ms. Marvel is the total package of cute teenaged superhero. I could have saw an entire movie with her. I felt I could have used more of Monica Rambeau seeing that out of the three this is the first real showcasing of her power (but I'm bias on that), and ofcourse Sam L. Jackson as Fury was fantastic.One problem that I had with this movie that I also had with Captain Marvel is that it did not feel big enough to be a Marvel Movie, it felt closer to one of the Disney Plus shows.But overall i had a blast and thankfully it was not a long ride. It gave just enough enjoyment.",
    "87": "The Marvels is a film like Barbie, made for women and by women, and yet, wasn't half as successful as Barbie and majority of their audience were men. As one of them, who skipped Barbie (as opposed to women who skipped this), I gotta say this was complete waste of time (and money). It's just a bad movie. But let's start from the beginning.Brie Larson wasn't a very good choice for any Marvel superheroine, certainly not for an obscure character like Captain Marvel. But the movie came and the rest is history. And now its half-sequel is here. And boy, as I stated already, it was royally bad. The director, who skipped the post-production on The Marvels middle-way thru, attempted to sell her film as wacky, goofy fun. I can only say this. The Marvels is not wacky, but it is goofy. And goofy not in a good way. Superheroes are goofy by default, but this took the game a step further.The plot is the biggest flaw. It lost its marbles after the first ten minutes and I didn't care about it for the rest of its 105mins running time. Which seems too short for these kinds of films, although 105mins was too much for me. The biggest selling gimmick, our trio exchanging powers, even after all obscure explanations, never really made any sense and their switching powers seem to work only when filmmakers tell you they work. Not one of the three heroines has a meaningful character arc, the movie should be about Carol Danvers, and while there was room for all three, I never had the feeling they were experiencing an emotional journey. Kamala just wants to be there, Monica acts like a job drone and Carol in the search of something that is even unknown to her. Even the villain is just a flat-out cardboard villain. People singing sequence is gross. Kittens swallowing people as a means of transportation massive gross. Music apart from generic bombastic tunes is meh, CGI atrocious, the editing a work of hack...a fail on very single level. The eponymous trio lacks chemistry. Kamala's quotes are sophomoric, but given she is an overexcited teenage girl, that can be forgiven, Monica seems the most level-headed of the trio, and Brie surprisingly acted less robotic and more nuanced than in the original Captain Marvel (those trailers didn't do her justice), but not in a game-changing manner.I guess we are reaching now the twilight of superheroes. All pointing that similar fate awaits Aquaman 2.",
    "88": "The Marvels is the sequel to Captain Marvel. This sequel is in-depth and written in part by Nia DaCosta, director of Little Woods and the 2021 Candyman sequel.After Captain Marvel's (Brie Larson) final actions with the Kree Empire, the tyrannical Kree Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) tries in her own way to return the Kree Empire to its former glory. These actions put other worlds at risk.Captain Marvel tries to stop Dar-Benn, only to find her powers tangled with those of Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani). When one of them uses their powers, they switch positions with each other. The three must work together during this force entanglement to stop Dar-Benn.This new film from the Marvel film series actually comes with some housework for the viewers. To clearly understand everything in this film, she actually expects you to be familiar with the first Captain Marvel film and the Marvel Disney+ series WandaVision and Ms. Marvel. Without this knowledge, there is a chance that you will not be able to clearly understand everything that exactly happened in this movie. A lack of this information can only make this film seem more obscure. Furthermore, the film sometimes seems a bit rushed and scattered. This could also be because the three writers of the film are not yet at the beginning side. For Nia DaCosta, this is only her third writing effort. The other two writers have only written stories from TV series. Although some of this series are also part of Marvel, this unfortunately did not provide much further experience.When the characters use their powers and move places, it only makes the events in the beginning of the film even more unclear. Especially when they don't seem to change places every time they use their powers, something that isn't really explained in detail in the film. The changing of superpowers is also something that has been used before in superhero films, such as in Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Even though this film had its limited aspects, she still managed to turn it into something comical every now and then.Due to the rushed pace and small aspects of this film, there seems to have been little room for some light moments of comedy. The young Iman Vellani knows how to provide some cheerful moments, but unfortunately this is quickly overshadowed by the more serious tone of the rest of the film and her co-stars. Brie Larson and Teyonah Parris play characters who have a history with each other, but in this film they are given little time and opportunities to do something with it. This is Samuel L. Jackson's 15th Marvel film project, but he doesn't get many opportunities to do anything special in this film and has just some room for light comedy moments. Zawe Ashton also plays more of a standard villain, which you as a viewer don't really care about.Due to the rushed aspects behind the film, the visual effects do not always appear convincing. When a green screen or further CGI is used, this is unfortunately visible. The visibility of this visual effects word sometimes even takes you out of the story.",
    "89": "I'm not sure where to start with this movie but it's not a girly girl's movie or even a message-heavy one like I heard it would be. It's a superhero movie. I guess, having three female leads and a female villain is just too much for some.Whatever's wrong with this movie comes down to the writing - that has its moments of greatness and fun - and the direction. It's not a complete mess since the movie holds up enough to have an exciting movie-going experience and very interesting implications for the future. Still, in the hands of a more experienced director and writer(s), this could have soared through the top of the box office with nothing for the haters to chew on.The leads have amazing chemistry. I thought Larson would have the best chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson because I've seen them work really well off of each other, but that magic is there with Vellani and Parris. Carol and Monica's storyline works so well, they could have milked it a little more but what's there serves its purpose, it enriches their history, adds layers to the plot and the MCU, and woves a nice touch of emotions to the movie. Vellani is charming throughout, her Kamala is a joy that fits in seamlessly with Carol and Monica. This team-up has a nice balance. We become attached to the characters and each of them a moment to shine or an emotional high at some point in the movie. The trio is the film's greatest strength, not just because of their chemistry and acting ability, but also their comedic timing. Vellani excels here, she's a bit more of the comedic relief, with Parris more of the straight man, and Larson a bit of both. The humor is well-balanced, it doesn't detract from the stakes.They did not skimp on the action scenes, there are plenty, nicely choreographed and their execution is more often great to serviceable than not and involves more people than you'd think. The same goes for the visual effects, they are solid better than in the trailers. However, this movie still suffers from what is a constant Marvel problem regarding most of their villains, they are a bit mustache-twirly. Dar-Benn doesn't have one but she's not given nearly enough to make her a compelling villain. The storyline is there, where we can see the potential depth and her character's motivation but Ashton is not given the time, yet she still manages to make it work.The Marvels could have been longer but this run-time works, it's short and sweet. It also has the same \"exciting things to come\" feel from earlier MCU movies even without the post-credit scenes.By @garcwrites.",
    "90": "It's hard to write a review about something that was so poor, when what we've been given is a mish-mash of weak plotlines and weaker characters.The acting can't be blamed and the protagonists do their best to keep the pace going, but what they have been given is a story that seems to have no idea what it wants to do.The action sequences are boring, the villain is extremely weak and given very little to do, and the heart that filled so many MCU films before it has been replaced with a scripted mess that doesn't make us want to invest in anything that's happening.The end credit scene adds intrigue to what comes next but certainly doesn't mask what has just been witnessed.Marvel need to go back to basics showing us characters that we deeply care for without losing the heart that kept us engaged for so long.",

I'm not sure what the Director was going for but it's quite disorienting.It feels like this film was somewhat butchered in the edit suite and perhaps there were re-shoots as it doesn't hang together coherently at all.Brie Larson is incapable of having chemistry with others, which we already know. The girl playing Ms Marvel was by far the most endearing.The Rambo character is a just a whole load of nothing and her acting for the post credit scene was embarrassing. I heard sniggers when they were clearly going for an emotional moment.I'd save your money if I were you.Wish I had.",
    "92": "It's just kind of bad, making it significantly better than I expected it to be.Starting with the good, I genuinely liked that this movie is intentionally silly. The teleportation premise makes for some genuinely amusing visual gags, and a great deal of absurd concepts made their way in here and the weirdness is embraced with glee.And, I liked the idea behind the villain and her motivations. Really, many of the ideas present in this movie are compelling ones.Sadly, none of them retain their intrigue in the execution.The execution of this film's plot, themes, and character arcs is all so...easy. Everything is written to wrap up in the most obvious, pandering, convenient possible way, leaving plenty of unfinished threads and stripping the story of any intelligence it may have had.And that's how this movie ends up feeling: unfinished.

The shorter run time helps a lot more than it hinders and it's just a really funny, wacky cosmic adventure that manages to be a contained story whilst still setting up exciting things for the future.Brie Larson is great, given so much more to work with this time so Carol has more personality and greater depth. She's still as funny as before but more remorseful, dealing with both the legacy and fallout of her actions as a soldier as well as feeling guilt over not spending as much time on Earth as she should've.Teyonah Parris gets the majority of the exposition yet still makes Monica a fully fledged character again. There's an initial unease at being reunited with Carol in these circumstances whilst still dealing with everything post blip that she's so good at conveying.Iman Vellani is the best though, improving everything with her presence. The enthusiasm she has for simply being in this world remains so genuine and as she's finally meeting her idol there's so much fun to be had when she's constantly freaking out. There's plenty of emotional heft too as she sees first-hand the sacrifice required to be a hero.Samuel L. Jackson is back to his fun loving version of Fury which feels like a huge apology for Secret Invasion. Zawe Ashton is another one-note MCU villain who has fun chewing scenery with some solid motivation until the third act betrays it all for a big CGI fight that doesn't make sense for the character.Nia DaCosta's direction isn't entirely free of studio intervention or feeling occasionally voiceless but this is still some of the strongest direction recently, helped by the body swapping antics of the plot which means the action sequences have a unique selling point for this one.The MCU has serious ongoing issues with its use of CGI and there's no doubt there's some weak points here (with a likely chance the team was massively overworked). However, the film generally looks pretty good in that department and the added time thanks to a later release date clearly helped a lot.",
    "94": "Here we have not just another financially disastrous so called \"flopbuster\" , but the mother of all MCU flopbusters to date with the movie scoring negative records. Marvel/Disney did it again, they managed to spend too much for an underwhelming final product that would have made sense only as a 30 million production going straight to streaming (in which case I may have awarded a higher score) not as an aspiring blockbuster, which begs the question if they are totally out of touch with reality there at Disney. The Marvels is a watchable movie only to stream while waiting for a pizza delivery or to take the kids to see but not good enough by a long shot to make mature audiences flock to the cinemas to offset the massive production and advertising budget.The movie is trying too hard to be funny and lighthearted while wasting what used to be one of the most iconic Hollywood actors until he started playing such roles, Samuel L. Jackson, who is reprising a mere shadow of \"Nick Fury\" character that use to make billions at the box office not so long ago; now he is an inconsequential minor cheerleader orbiting an incoherent bunch of female spandex-clad superheroes fighting a badly cast, totally unconvincing, instantly forgettable female arch-nemesis. Simplistic shallow story that we've seen many times but done way better, no suspense, disconnected action, characters with the depth of a pothole no one cares to identify with or remember as soon as the movie is over, unnecessary messy CGI, with a badly done touch of sentimentality and feline cuteness, it's not worth the fuss, just wait for it to stream if you really need to watch a pretty average movie.The \"superhero fatigue\" explanation cannot be the deciding factor here when the product is actually bad and not made to appeal to the masses and thus turn a profit.",
    "95": "I finally got the chance to watch the Marvels yesterday, and I was laughing at some of the parts that gave some sort of Disney musical vibes in my honest opinion, and also some animation Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse vibes.I mean don't get me wrong, I love the Spider-Verse movies, but for the Marvels tho, I kinda predicted the same reactions it has gotten sense the first Captain Marvel. Also went pretty badly at the box office. But that doesn't mean it's the end of the MCU.They still got some upcoming Marvel movies for next year so, it should be fine for now. The Marvels was alright, but I gotta be honest, the writing, and the story, and the new villain was a pretty bad writing, except for Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel.Iman Vellani did a solid well done with her best performance, and Teyonah Parris did a good job with her part, and Brie Larson was having so much fun with her role. But like I said, it was an okay movie.7/10.",
    "96": "If you, like many others, have opted out of the past few Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films and are, likewise, suffering from \"SuperHero\" fatigue but are now looking for a re-entry into the MCU, then THE MARVELS is the film for you, for unlike some previous MCU films, it does not take much in the way of previous knowledge to get into the flow of this (somewhat) lightweight, fun action comic-book flick.Academy Award winner Brie Larson returns as Captain Marvel and is joined (literally) with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris - who's SuperHero Origin story can be found in the DisneyPlus TV Series WANDAVISION, but is summed up pretty quickly here, so you'll get the drift) as well as young MS. MARVEL (Iman Vellani, who's origin story is told in the DisnePlus TV Series MS. MARVEL but who's story is summed pretty quickly - and pretty well - here). They join forces to fight a villain, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) intent on inflicting revenge/punishment on Captain Marvel. Also along for the ride is good ol' Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury (in his 15th appearance in an MCU vehicle). They all bounce around the scenarios with a winking knowledge - and earnestness - about what kind of movie they are making...and with which what tone they need to hit.In the hands of Director Nia DaCosta (the 2020 remake of CANDYMAN), THE MARVELS moves along at a brisk pace, injecting some humor and decent (enough) action sequences and CGI mixed in with a clever segment or 2 (one scene set to a classic Musical Theater song is worth the price of admission in and of itself). There is enough light, breezy sequences and banter that the main word that comes out of this film is \"fun\". DaCosta succeeds, very well, with fun in this film. Where she doesn't succeed as well is in emotional heft. Captain Marvel is given a few \"self reflective\" moments and while Larson is a terrific actor and tries to succeed with these moments, they didn't feel earned, so they fell flat. Unfortunately, the other characters are there to battle and throw off one-liners...and not much more.Wisely, DaCosta limits this film to 1 hours and 45 minutes - the shortest MCU film to date - and this is a positive for she just \"gets to it\" and doesn't linger on any of the moments that don't work or would fall apart if anyone had anytime to think about them.And, of course, the \"extra scenes\" (an MCU staple) set up 2 new franchises, so you want to stick around for them (but you don't need to stick around to the end of the credits).All-in-all - Ms. Marvel is a fun, lightweight romp that will entertain for the time you are in the cineplex. But not much more. But...isn't that what going to the movies is all about?Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",
    "97": "Marvel has pretty much fallen after Endgame!Their shinning bright light was No Way Home but post that every series/movie has been a disaster.Somehow Loki Season 2 was different and good,but again this movie was worse from every angle!Such a weak cast,poor storytelling,didn't feel any kind of connection with the movie.It was more like watch and forget then and there!Not at all recommended.I don't understand what the Marvel house is thinking of their future,because it's not looking good with these kind of disasters one after another!I watched this movie just because of being a loyal fan to Marvel for the last one decade but now I feel it's time that I stop watching these in theatres. It's not worth!",
    "98": "As with a lot of studio-created girl groups, the women fronting \"The Marvels\" are carefully styled, wear coordinated outfits during their big numbers, have a few flashily choreographed moves and, because they've clearly put in the rehearsal time, know how to harmonize (more or less). The group has been created for maximum bankability, familiarity and relatability, and to that instrumental end, it delivers exactly what you expect of it and not a single thing, idea or beat more. Its members are nice, even at their most ostensibly fierce, and so unrelievedly bland that it feels like an affront, especially to all the women here doing so much hard work.This is the 33rd movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which continues to expand even as its cultural interest and resonance diminish. \"The Marvels\" will dominate the box office, of course, at least during its opening weekend, just because it will flood theaters. It's pointless complaining, I know (believe me), but it's frustrating what weak tea this movie is because the director, Nia DaCosta (\"Little Woods,\" \"Candyman\"), has talent, the cast is appealing, and there's a lightly gonzo scene that shows you what the other 100 minutes could have been. It's almost as if the suits at Marvel Studios know it doesn't matter if their movies are any good. Once again, Brie Larson plays Captain Marvel a.k.a. Carol Danvers, a former Air Force pilot who inadvertently picked up her superpowers once upon a time. She kept on flying throughout the decades, though sometimes without a craft, hurtling through space and fighting alongside the Avengers all while maintaining her dewily youthful looks. When she first appears here, she is hanging out with her scene-stealing orange tabby, Goose (played by Tango and Nemo), on her spaceship and doing something important-looking. Soon, with Goose perched on one shoulder - no spacesuits here - this very special cat lady is zipping off to a planet and into another over-plotted, overextended escapade. This time she's joined by two super-empowered beings from the small screen: Kamala Khan a.k.a. Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani), a Captain Marvel superfan from Jersey City (and Disney+); and Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris), an astronaut (introduced as an adult in the series \"WandaVision\") who's part of S. A. B. E. R. In the interest of moving this review along - and because I had no idea what Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) was doing in space with a bunch of uniformed lackeys (other than barking orders with his usual gruffness) - here is how the movie's production notes describe S. A. B. E. R: \"a space station covertly acting as Earth's first point of contact and defense from a rapidly expanding universe.\" Written by DaCosta, Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik, \"The Marvels\" reunites old friends and foes while introducing new characters and developments, all of which will presumably be folded into future installments, as is the Marvel way. The big fights and minor tension are principally generated by the villainous Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), the ruler (or, in Marvel-speak, Supremor) of the Kree people; she wields a mighty hammer and bears a grudge against Captain Marvel. In one of the larger set pieces, Dar-Benn takes brutal aim against other enemies. As terrified men, women and children flee and buildings fall, the scene briefly summons up visions of our world, which the movie otherwise phenomenally shows the true nature of Marvel. As is always the case with Marvel directors, DaCosta's principal job seems to be to keep the greased gears moving as she folds in innumerable close-ups of happy, sad and mad faces, all of which are meant to remind viewers that their heroes are just like us, only super. To underscore this point, Kamala's fangirl shtick goes on too long; the character is doodling images of her idol when the movie opens and sometime later wears a T-shirt emblazoned with Captain Marvel's image. Once the character calms down, so does Vellani, an appealing performer with comic timing who nicely bounces off both Larson and Parris. They, in turn, have been given an unfortunate surrogate mother-daughter dynamic that is fortunately underdeveloped because all you really want to do is watch Goose, who's indeed golden.",
    "99": "Giving this an 8/10 ratingAfter the glorious 'Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3', I was kind of worried how this one will play out, people were already writing it off before anything was done. Well, I'm very happy with this film, for a start, it's the shortest Marvel film on the cinema, and that's good. It's very lean, and I mean, lean, straight to the point.The story itself is the age old one, the quest of... well if you see the film you will know. It has lots of new and old faces, Samuel L jackson is playing Nick Fury for the last time here, but that can change, and yes there is end credit extra, just one this time.The vfx are much better too, the script is very tight, and there is comedy for sure, which does work. I must admit it does feel like they tried the look and feel of a 'Bollywood' film, it does there, in my opinion, which is not a bad thing. Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani, interact very well and certainly have been well fight trained, as the action does not let up, and the film is just fun, and that is enough. That is why I gave it an 8/10, it's un and get's the job done.",
    "100": "What on earth was that? I have NEVER left the cinema in the middle of a movie. Especially with how expensive it is nowadays.My family and I went with no expectations...NO expectations. We had a strong feeling it wouldn't be good but it was a trip to the cinema so we didn't mind. Couldn't finish.Was it a superhero film, a children's film or a musical? I have no idea. Anyone that's a fan of the comics is feeling insulted right now. An absolute insult to Stan Lee.Nothing made sense! An absolute mess. Terrible dialogue which led to even more terrible acting. Can tell the script was written by AI. Hated every character as there was no development. Why did every character seem stupid? Captain marvel is supposed to be one of the most powerful superheroes and yet was a bumbling, weak mess. Felt so childish!We've gone from the Iron man films to THIS?MCU is officially dead. Thanks Disney!",
    "101": "It was hard to stay awake during this movie, that's how boring it is. I almost walked out to go sit in the lobby it's so boring. I don't care what kind of agenda is being pushed in this movie, just don't be boring. I could not stop nodding off during this movie. Even though this movie is only an hour and a half, it was too long and hard to care about anything going on. I've seen both Oppenheimer and Flowers of the Killer Moon and never once felt tired during those and both are over 3 hours.I actually didn't mind the first Captain Marvel movie. It was alright, I don't think it deserved all the hate that it got. But this one is terrible and maybe the worst Marvel movie yet. Which is sad because Eternals, Thor 4, Ant-Man 3, and Shang Chi exists.Two of the biggest problems with this movie for me were Nick Fury and Ms. Marvel. It's sad what Nick Fury has been reduced to now. His character is now a joke and it's about time for Sam Jackson to hang it up with this character. There is a scene towards the end with his character and cats evacuating a ship that is so stupid, if I would have come alone, I would have walked out.I don't know anything about Ms. Marvel because I didn't waste my time watching the Disney+ show. And after seeing this and seeing how annoying she is, I will never watch that show. Her voice and her yelling were so damn annoying.I think this is it folks, Marvel is truly dead but truthfully, it's been dead way before Phase 4 or whatever phase this is. There's just no Iron Man or Captain America to hide how bad these movies are anymore. And no amount of cameos from 2000's Marvel films, fan service or backing a Brinks truck up to Robert Downey Jr.'s house is going to save these movies either.",
    "102": "I'm writing the review as the movie is about to wrap up, while in the theater. It's fairly empty, so no one cares.How did they even put this out? They have to give you an early recap of Ms Marvel's Disney+ show because apparently, no one watched it and would even understand her character. The entire premise of this between the motivations of the big bad, to the power swaps, is preposterous. This seems as if it's a sequel to some movie that doesn't exist.Brie Larson plays the role like an A. I. trying to portray emotions. She found a way to be less enjoyable in this follow-up than Captain Marvel. Monica Rambo's hero name, be it Quasar or Photon most likely, still hasn't officially been named.The actress that plays Ms Marvel is likeable, but more suited for television as opposed to big budget movies like this. There are times the action sequences start off okay just to he derailed by a slapped on poor effect or strange directorial choice.This movie may be worse than the abomination that was The Eternals and may be the nail in the coffin for Disney Marvel.1 star over minimum for a few cool special effects and the Ms Marvel actress seeming to enjoy playing her character.",
    "103": "I have only ever walked out of a movie once in my lengthy adulthood of cinema going but this drivel had me considering it and sadly very early on in the screening.The only thing that kept me in my seat was the fascination of how awful the movie was and the curiosity could it continue to be consistently bad.It was.Now I'll give some acknowledgment, I hadn't seen the tv series spin off, but actually seeing the character of Ms. Marvel I am glad I was spared that ordeal.The movie is a just a mess, mundane plot, sterile characters and some really dodgy acting by all, it really was just a pick up the cheque but I guess if the script is drivel what can they do.One good joke, cat reference background song.My advice, give it a miss, however if you are going make sure you've seen Ms. Marvel, if not then don't waste your time and money.",
    "104": "It's just kind of bad, making it significantly better than I expected it to be.Starting with the good, I genuinely liked that this movie is intentionally silly. The teleportation premise makes for some genuinely amusing visual gags, and a great deal of absurd concepts made their way in here and the weirdness is embraced with glee.And, I liked the idea behind the villain and her motivations. Really, many of the ideas present in this movie are compelling ones.Sadly, none of them retain their intrigue in the execution.The execution of this film's plot, themes, and character arcs is all so...easy. Everything is written to wrap up in the most obvious, pandering, convenient possible way, leaving plenty of unfinished threads and stripping the story of any intelligence it may have had.And that's how this movie ends up feeling: unfinished.

    "113": "It was hard to stay awake during this movie, that's how boring it is. I almost walked out to go sit in the lobby it's so boring. I don't care what kind of agenda is being pushed in this movie, just don't be boring. I could not stop nodding off during this movie. Even though this movie is only an hour and a half, it was too long and hard to care about anything going on. I've seen both Oppenheimer and Flowers of the Killer Moon and never once felt tired during those and both are over 3 hours.I actually didn't mind the first Captain Marvel movie. It was alright, I don't think it deserved all the hate that it got. But this one is terrible and maybe the worst Marvel movie yet. Which is sad because Eternals, Thor 4, Ant-Man 3, and Shang Chi exists.Two of the biggest problems with this movie for me were Nick Fury and Ms. Marvel. It's sad what Nick Fury has been reduced to now. His character is now a joke and it's about time for Sam Jackson to hang it up with this character. There is a scene towards the end with his character and cats evacuating a ship that is so stupid, if I would have come alone, I would have walked out.I don't know anything about Ms. Marvel because I didn't waste my time watching the Disney+ show. And after seeing this and seeing how annoying she is, I will never watch that show. Her voice and her yelling were so damn annoying.I think this is it folks, Marvel is truly dead but truthfully, it's been dead way before Phase 4 or whatever phase this is. There's just no Iron Man or Captain America to hide how bad these movies are anymore. And no amount of cameos from 2000's Marvel films, fan service or backing a Brinks truck up to Robert Downey Jr.'s house is going to save these movies either.",
    "114": "I'm writing the review as the movie is about to wrap up, while in the theater. It's fairly empty, so no one cares.How did they even put this out? They have to give you an early recap of Ms Marvel's Disney+ show because apparently, no one watched it and would even understand her character. The entire premise of this between the motivations of the big bad, to the power swaps, is preposterous. This seems as if it's a sequel to some movie that doesn't exist.Brie Larson plays the role like an A. I. trying to portray emotions. She found a way to be less enjoyable in this follow-up than Captain Marvel. Monica Rambo's hero name, be it Quasar or Photon most likely, still hasn't officially been named.The actress that plays Ms Marvel is likeable, but more suited for television as opposed to big budget movies like this. There are times the action sequences start off okay just to he derailed by a slapped on poor effect or strange directorial choice.This movie may be worse than the abomination that was The Eternals and may be the nail in the coffin for Disney Marvel.1 star over minimum for a few cool special effects and the Ms Marvel actress seeming to enjoy playing her character.",
    "115": "I have only ever walked out of a movie once in my lengthy adulthood of cinema going but this drivel had me considering it and sadly very early on in the screening.The only thing that kept me in my seat was the fascination of how awful the movie was and the curiosity could it continue to be consistently bad.It was.Now I'll give some acknowledgment, I hadn't seen the tv series spin off, but actually seeing the character of Ms. Marvel I am glad I was spared that ordeal.The movie is a just a mess, mundane plot, sterile characters and some really dodgy acting by all, it really was just a pick up the cheque but I guess if the script is drivel what can they do.One good joke, cat reference background song.My advice, give it a miss, however if you are going make sure you've seen Ms. Marvel, if not then don't waste your time and money.",
    "116": "Wow.This film isn't afraid to take risks. That's normally a good thing. Not this time.Marvel still knows how to shock an audience this time it was a musical planet with Bollywood dance number. I was agast, thinking I was hallucinating.I love Kevin Feige as a visionary. I fear he's been replaced by a Skrull. Either that or he's being held in a Disney dungeon to force him to make this stuff.Please send in the Hulk to smash him out. Until then, stop making movies without a decent script, decent development time for the overworked CGI legends, AND an story people care about without a subscription to Disney+. Tag on a good director & let them do something awesome.",
    "117": "The Marvels is a cinematic catastrophe. It is a film so bad that it makes previous Marvel films like Eternals and Thor: Love and Thunder look like masterpieces. The film is a complete and utter failure on every level, from its story to its characters to its action.The story of The Marvels is a nonsensical mess. It is a convoluted and confusing plot that is full of holes. The film tries to do too much, and it ends up doing nothing well. The characters are all underdeveloped and unlikable. Carol Danvers is a bland and boring protagonist. Monica Rambeau is a whiny and annoying sidekick. And Kamala Khan is a cringe-inducing caricature of a teenage fangirl.The action in The Marvels is uninspired and generic. There are no memorable fight scenes, and the CGI is often laughable. The film's climax is a particularly embarrassing sequence that is both visually unimpressive and emotionally empty.Overall, The Marvels is a terrible film. It is a soulless and lifeless corporate product that is devoid of any creativity or passion. It is a film that is so bad that it is actually offensive.",
    "118": "I've been a Marvel fan, initially through the comics, for more than 40 years.So I've seen every film and show as they've come out. In recent years I've felt it more a duty to watch them rather than because they're brilliantly written.(My favourite show will always be Netflix's Daredevil, and we all know that this isn't treated as Marvel canon).Anyway, I went to see The Marvels at Sydney's new IMAX this afternoon (full house) and I have to say it was good fun.Not great fun, but good. There was some great action in places and it was very silly in other places. But it kinda worked. It didn't feel like a chore to be there.So just go along, take off your critical hat and enjoy it.And I will never be able to listen to Memories, from the musical Cats, in the same way ever again!",
    "119": "Finally, Carol Danvers, Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau reunite for what should be their great adventure together, but it's not far from being just another episode of Marvel to pass the time. It's not really a bad movie, but it does get a little crazy in some situations as Nia DaCosta promised. The action scenes and special effects are always present to offer exciting moments, despite there being some absurd moments. The movie is fun in those aspects, but it still feels like just another superhero movie. Samuel L. Jackson does not disappoint in his role as Nick Fury, although he returns to his role of being just the boss in command who gives the orders and assigns the missions. The three heroines manage to have good chemistry that makes them a good team. Carol Danvers has more personality in this movie, since the first time she appeared in the MCU, she felt somewhat generic. Here she was able to improve with the bonds she forms with her companions, the awareness she gains about her role as Captain Marvel, and the recognition of a mistake she made leading to the events of this film and that Now she must make amends. Kamala Khan is definitely the best of the trio, being very charismatic and cheerful like in Ms. Marvel and it is clear that Iman Vellani proves to be a young actress with a bright future ahead of her. The rest of the characters who could have participated more contribute little and even the villain has an interesting past that could have been explored further. Really, The Marvels is just another Marvel movie that offers a bit of entertainment and does not deserve the rejection it has been receiving even though it is not a masterpiece. It is not even strange that this film is unconvincing for a certain sector and even more so considering that this is the first time that Nia directed a superhero film, which was too big a challenge for someone who is still in his beginnings. In conclusion, The Marvels is just another episode in the world of Marvel like the rest of its installments, but that doesn't mean it's really a bad movie. My final and only valid rating for this film is an 8/10.",
    "120": "This Marvel production is eclectic and pretty atypical, so it for sure is gonna unsettle a lot of people. But to me, it takes the cake with this will to lead the story in a nice variety of directions while pulsating with a powerful colorful energy ! It has lots of funny moments as well as a few emotional ones (that help cimenting the vibrant connection between the characters)... It's served with several cool scenes and visuals, creative fights and action, heartwarming dialogs, with also a few very serious or high stakes type of moments as well as a few quirky bits (that are for sure gonna bother certain viewers, such as some of my friends btw).Overall a pretty unique vibe, it is an entertaining ride that doesn't shy from going in diverse creative places. It's high in colors, with an intense energy that doesn't weaken from beginning to end (the last 15-20 minutes focusing more on emotion), and the last few scenes introduce some great stuffs in a very cool way.The power of unity and pure friendship always succeeds !A Marvel movie that has heart, that's for sure.",
    "121": "Mass producing machine MARVEL produced another superhero movie, but the funny thing is: to completely understand this movie, to know and understand each character and culture that appears in this movie, you need to watch 8 other movies and 4 series' - yes I counted it - and I didn't count the movies you need to watch first to understand the movies you need to watch to understand this movie, which would probably double the amount. Well this gets a bit complicated. Marvel movies were all connected since the beginning which is the reason so many loved Marvel, yet they have pushed this concept too far. But what do I really think about this movie?Many movies including this one, Fast X or the upcoming Aquaman 2, have the same antagonist motivation: Revenge. It's BORING Marvel, it's BORING Universal, it's BORING DC/WB. However, they somehow still don't get it.On the other hand, The Marvels is a true masterpiece in terms of fun and cuteness. To see Gosse eating people or Kamala Kahn being a fan girl just warms up my heart. Additionally, it seems like Marvel gave the VFX artists some space to breath because the VFX aren't that bad. Oh and Samuel L Jackson is a scene steeler as always, just a pleasure to see him.If you have accepted the current quality of superhero movies, you can definitely enjoy this The Marvels and even if you don't, the movie only goes 105 minutes, so a pretty great deal right?",
    "122": "I'm a fan of Captain Marvel. Sure, she's overpowered and a bit cocky, but I like her. I was excited but was also equally prepared for \"Ant-Man: Quantumania\" crapfest. The movie has its flaws, but it's undeniably entertaining-I left with a smile on my face. If you watch in a happy mood you'll enjoy it, but if you go in with prejudice or wanting to hate it or be disappointed then you might. Despite its flaws, I won't argue that there aren't any, but I'll disagree with anyone who says it's not fun.So, I can list all the positives about this movie in a single paragraph, and I do have quite a few criticisms that I'll get into later. But, no matter what I end up saying, the movie is just plain fun-it's an enjoyable experience. I wasn't bored or disinterested at any point; I didn't feel the urge to check my phone for messages or anything. I was thoroughly entertained and had a good time. The criticisms only came to mind after a good night's sleep when I had the chance to reflect, but even with all that, I genuinely enjoyed it.Captain Marvel's got cocky attitude, but she's undeniably strong so she backs it up, i mean she went toe to toe with Thanosü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I also don't think she was as cocky as usual here. Nick Fury's reaction to seeing Ms. Marvel for the first time was just perfect, chefs kiss. It's great to see him back to being the cool and badass character after the disappointing Secret Wars series. The action was cool, with really enjoyable fight sequences, I was hooked throughout. And let's talk about the havoc they wreaked on Kamala's house; it brings home the idea that if superheroes were real, we'd probably hate them, and so would insurance companies lol.I was curious about the vibes it would bring since Ms. Marvel, Captain Marvel, and Monica all bring different auras to the screen. It got me wondering how they would interact, Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel appeared destined to cross paths, and Captain Marvel's connection with her niece, Monica, made sense. It looks like Carol was meant to bridge the gap between Kamala and my Monica, I guess. Iman Vellani's liveliness stole the show.Watching it on IMAX felt pretty epic, felt immersive but I had some issues with the green screen, particularly in the space scenes where the background felt a bit too empty at times. I get that space is vast emptiness, a little more detail could be nice. The graphics were generally good, although there were moments when they fell a bit short.Not a fan of the time jumps. I don't think the recap was necessary, but not everyone watches all the movies and series, so maybe need a little memory jog.I was okay with gender-swapping villain as I'm not a comic book fan. However, Dar-Benn didn't get enough time for proper development; the bare minimum with \"the annihilator\" backstory. It made sense, but we needed more time with her before the events of the movie unfolded. One of my favorite MCU movies is \"Age of Ultron\" because they introduced and defeated Ultron in the same film, and it felt complete story arc. In Dar-Benn's case, it felt rushed, leaving us without the chance to care, fear, or learn about her and her powers-just a brief explanation of her motives.I'm know Captain Marvel is incredibly strong and quick, which is why I like her. I'm a fan of \"overpowered\" superheroes, hence DC characters; but the way she just pops up out of nowhere was insane. Like did you fly here that quick?? And when did she and Tessa Thompson's character become such close friends?? I thought I'd hate the singing planet part, but it wasn't bad; didn't enjoy it, didn't hate it either.I was confused about how they got 'untangled'. Maybe I missed something, but I don't think it was properly explained. It also felt quite unrealistic that, out of everyone in the MCU, only these three characters had light powers. I would have expected more characters to be entangled, but I guess that might have complicated things.It felt longer than it actually was, but in a good way, like the runtime was filled and the movie didn't drag. But it also felt like some parts of the plot were simply missing.There was excessive hugging, i didn't care them by the last two or so. Also they just moved into Monica's house? I really love the credit scene and what it sets up for the future, However people complain movies these days are just set ups for others. I don't think this movie did that too unnaturally. Only the ending.First movie in a while that's made me feel like superhero fatigue may not be a thing, other than GOTG 3. Like Loki s2 is currently making me feel like there's superhero burnout.I believe the chemistry between the characters could have been portrayed better, but I don't necessarily see it as a flaw from this particular movie, more like an issue with the movies/shows that preceded it. As mentioned earlier, the fan-girling between Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel makes sense. But, the connection between Aunt Carol and Monica, despite knowing the backstory, didn't quite hit the emotional chords. That emotional aspect, is what the movie was missing in general.I think with so many movies and shows, plus significant gaps between a movie and its sequel, there's a risk of losing the emotional connection between the two. The time span from \"Captain Marvel\" to \"The Marvels\" is quite extensive. Nowadays, Marvel movies seem more focused on connecting superheroes' stories rather than emphasizing the emotional connections. It's all about how the multiverse links up and how many characters can be packed into a movie to showcase a unified world. It's fun at times but feels unnecessary at others. I don't see it as a flaw specific to \"The Marvels\" movie; it seems more like an overarching issue within the MCU. Reminds me of diseconomies of scale lol. I wonder if Star Wars franchise has the same problems of being too large.Monica feels like a character that should've stayed as a side character, at least for now because it felt like she was promoted too quickly to shared lead roles.I feel like Ms. Marvel was the only character with real depth from having her own series and being more recent. Captain Marvel had a movie, but the issue is that people seem to dislike her because she only appears when needed, kicks ass, and then disappears without much exploration. I'd genuinely love to see more of her and her intergalactic adventures. The movie's villain comes from a 30-year stretch of Captain Marvel's adventures that we never got to see, and it feels like they just threw her in to compensate. Similarly, Captain Marvel's character seems under-explored, and it's disappointing because I wish they delved deeper. I love her, but her depictions have always felt a bit lackluster. It's frustrating that both Captain Marvel and Brie Larson have so much potential but aren't given enough to work with. So I get why people hate her, but I wish marvel did something to change that. This movie helps, but she wasn't the highlight of the film.Ms. Marvel truly carries movie; it felt more like her film than a Captain Marvel sequel. If you liked the Ms. Marvel TV series, this movie brings that same kind of fun to the table. And I'll say it again-I won't believe anyone who claims it's not fun because, despite its flaws, it's undeniably fun. Just being a hater if you don't accept that it's fun at the very least. At the very least.Edit after seeing some reviews: I find that those giving sub 3/10 ratings are a bit excessive- close the extremes of rating either 10/10 or 1/10. I typically reserve such low ratings for movies like \"Cosmic Sin (2021),\" Morgan Freeman's \"Vanquish,\" \"Beast,\" or \"It's a Wonderful Knife\"-movies that are genuinely dull and uninspiring lol.",
    "123": "Carol Danvers is certainly a noteworthy character in the Marvel pantheon but the most memorable part of the original entry was the controversy surrounding it's star Brie Larson. Brie's supposed infamy wasn't deserved, she had so much vitriol spewed her way and it took the focus away from her actual work. Her take on the character was less animated and more stoic but that choice is a product of many people, not just her. With all that said however, her performance in The Marvels is fine but falls short of spectacular. They make a concerted effort to humanize Carol but it only works somewhat and I actually missed some of the dry humour Brie brought to the original film. Iman Vellani shines the brightest of the central three. The humour surrounding Kamala's fangirling over Captain Marvel works the most consistently. She's certainly the most relatable and Iman's awkwardness comes across as genuine. Her earnestness could have been grating had it continued at the initial pace but she smartly tones it down slowly over the course of the run time to further Kamala's growth. I thought Teyonah Parris got the least meaty material as Monica Rambeau. Teyonah has been a scene-stealer in other projects for me and to be fair, she's still fine in The Marvels. But I think with her talent level, she should have been given more time and more room to really show what she could do in this role. Samuel L. Jackson is always welcome to pop in as Marvel regular Nick Fury. I got a couple of chuckles from him but I surprisingly even found his work a little underwhelming here. He lacked the same zip in The Marvels and he seemed less than engaged. Zawe Ashton tries as the group's foil Dar-Benn but she's destined to get lumped in with of Marvel's more forgettable antagonists.Carol's vast and varied power set creates all sorts of possibilities and when you combine that with the character swapping, there's so many different directions you could go with the action set-pieces. The Marvels looks good (and it's obviously well financed) and has a few standout moments in the action. Most notably the initial set-piece where the characters are flipping locations almost constantly has some satisfying punch. I also wanted to point out that just like Multiverse of Madness, the weirder moments in The Marvels are some of the best. The logic and practice surrounding the payoff of the Goose subplot seems a little flawed but I laughed hard and couldn't help but ponder the implications about where the movie decides to go with it.In my previous paragraph about the performances, I can't lay the blame for the scattershot success of The Marvels at the feet of the cast. The worst part of The Marvels is the wasted opportunities and choppy nature of the final product. There's all these rumours about extensive reshoots and drama behind-the-scenes and while I'm not read into the specifics, you can see it in this cut of this movie. So much of the drama or the set up for the respective character's emotional payoff is skipped over and it undercuts some of the more poignant scenes. Monica's regret and anger directed at Carol not being around comes off as petulant but only because it's not covered properly through the movie's flashbacks. Ditto for Carol's shame over how she handled the climactic battle with the Kree, it could have been affecting if given enough screen time but it's an afterthought in The Marvels. To punctuate this, what really astonished me was how rushed the ending felt. A shorter Marvel film is a blessing but the climactic battle between our heroes and Dar-Benn is so anti-climactic and the solution to her villainous plan has so little oomph and is so slapdash that The Marvels ends on a whimper. I was wondering if the movie had a mandate to be less than 2 hours and it was trying to beat the buzzer. I would also give The Marvels more credit if this decision tried to buck the formula but the movie is all the more formulaic for it.I'm usually in the theatre for opening weekend for most of Marvel's movies, some are amazing, most are good and you have the occasional misfire (I'm looking at you Ant-Man and the Wasp). I wanted to see what another Captain Marvel adventure would look like but I was also looking forward to this because it was Nia Da Costa directing. A tentpole franchise is a different animal but I'd truly enjoyed some of her other directorial efforts (Little Woods was great and Candyman was pretty good). I was disappointed that there wasn't any of her Candyman style flair in this. The Marvels is a passable effort with some intriguing moments packed in. It's certainly not the \"cinematic travesty\" some would have you believe. But it's also rushed, lacking distinctive qualities and overall just okay. With most of Marvel's recent output (Guardians 3 being the exception), we can't deny that superhero fatigue is officially here and if this genre is going to continue to thrive, we need a few daring films to steal back people's attention. I'd grade The Marvels somewhere between a 6-7 and as much as I wanted it to be worth a trip to the theatre, you'd get just as much checking it out on streaming. The original Captain Marvel was flawed but it was markedly better than The Marvels. I can't help but feel sorry for those involved with this project. There was obviously conflicting visions about what The Marvels should be and The Marvels clearly suffered for it. It's also most likely an unceremonious end for what could have been a key Marvel character moving forward and that's just plain disappointing.",
    "124": "LIKES:Fast Pace\n-This is not some convoluted tale, this is a very big focus on essentially entertainment, action, and fun.-The Marvels puts the petal down to the floor and keeps that pace going to keep your mind entertained with very little downtime.-It amplifies the action, supports the comedy, and keeps the theme of fun without getting too lost in Eternals like drama, which may be a plus for many given some of the dryer pieces on the TV.-Thus, those wanting just that escapism, get this for the most part.Funny, to a Degree:\n-The movie tries to be one point back to the 90s feel of the first Captain Marvel, while also trying out some new things that bring Ms. Marvel.-It worked for me. There were some really funny moments that had me in stitches. Primarily Nick Fury and Kamala's parents were the ones making me laugh, but I appreciated the effort and some mix-ups the movie did.-Plus, the writing accomplishes some well-time lines to be entertaining and representative of the characters they built from the previous series.-Plus, for those that love the current trend of stuffing a lot of jokes into a short time, this is a plus and a like for you as well.The Acting:\n-Certainly not award winning, ground breaking, or even top caliber for the Marvel Universe, this cast still has some shine to it.-Jackson's role might be sillier and less of the grit and grime I like, but the man's turn of phrase and looks still make me laugh and what he accomplished with this role.-Vellani does her job well as the ever enthusiastic Khan, a fan girl at heart with a lot of that pep and obsession that we see in the comics. She's light, airy, total fangirling, and yet surprisingly deep when she needs to be. Certainly the sore thumb to the rest of the cast's dynamic, she achieves much in bridging a lot of things to come.-Parris' role is much like her Wandavision, feeling one part drama, one part comedy, and one part invigorating. She's got a decent grasp on the character's trauma, and delivers her lines well with fortitude, edge, but yet never going too far. I really liked her chemistry with so many characters.-Larson is intense as ever, really diving into the extremes and keeping that chilling face of stone cold passive force. Yet, the woman did dive into some comedy and I was pleased with some of the things she accomplished in her action hero role. Most notably about the second half of the movie when she hit her stride, this was better for me than her previous roles.The Story Elements, a Little\n-The movie has some pockets of character drawing and actual ethical components that strike hard and paint the superhero world again in shades of grey.-Danvers and Rambeau's stories hold a bit more punch, some relevance to me making it surprisingly complex, and giving us that relief from the silly storms of stuttering and speaking that this movie is loaded with.-Khan's story holds touching moments as well, which as a bridge really help add some moral lessons that might go well with an extreme fan to learn.-Surprisingly, even the villain's motifs have some surprises and perhaps the most impressive thing about them, so that's a plus as well.The Mid-Credit Scene\n-It's the only scene so you can leave afterwards if you want.-However, it really helps with the excitement factor for many and showing the next steps coming to help straighten out the rumors of the mess that is Marvel.-I won't say more, but this was one of the better end credit scenes that sort of felt like the original three phases.The Action:\n-The Marvels' fighting moments finally start feeling like we have someone who understands a superhero movie fighting elements.-There are about three noteworthy fights I will call them, and these held the energy, pizazz, and character that movies like the Avengers, Winter Soldier, Guardians 1 and 3, and Shang Chi held.-A tad trending into stiff choreography at times, the movie fortunately uses the fast pace to really unload that comic book feel.-Diversity settles in that though there is a common fight element, the scenery and the amount of things happening freshens it up a bit and make it really fun.-And that first battle, was probably the one that showed the most promise and was the peak, though the others aren't bad, but for a few things I'll mention soon.-Overall, this action element was very pleasing to me.DISLIKES:The Villain Is Forgettable:\n-I agree with other reviewers I have read, the main antagonist is quite honestly one of the lesser villains I have cared about in a very long time.-Dar-Benn's plot is stronger than her character, lacking any real development, unique aspects, or even those memorable moments outside of some cool fashion, one notable speech, and her piercing eyes.-Her origin story is simplistically boring and lasts less than thirty seconds, and any attempt to connect with her crew or rivalry, shockingly limited and lacking compared to others.-I held no connection or suspenseful purpose to her and felt she was an accessory given everything in this movie. The actress did a fine job, but not even her skills could save her character from the chief flaw of this movie.Too Much Comedy?-It depends on your tolerance and like and style for this to be a dislike.-I love a good comedy that balances and delivers those lines perfectly and has a variety, which this does several times for me.-Yet, the movie is a bit too dependent on the jokes, a lot of banter, nicknames, lines, and an aggressively comedic style that is too much for viewers like me.-Khan's character can be super annoying, and her chatter grates my nerves before they had her try a new approach. While even her parents excessive judgement got a bit looser and haphazard that didn't work for me.-Too many puns, an odd joke with singing feeling out of place, and even some dark comedy that feels out of sorts, the direction for this movie may have needed some fine tuning to match some of my other favorite movies.The Visual Effects:\n-At times, they are amazing with what they have come up with to make this comic book come to life with the effects they do.-Plasma bolts pop, punches and walls break, and there is color all around that is super exciting and that dazzle I love for the theater.-And then there are times where the effects look weak, forced, and editing has led to bad blends, stiff movements, and very cheesy looks that mirror a cel-shaded video game.-It's minor dislike at most times, but something I do agree that it's not their cleanest work.The Editing/Adaptations:\n-The rumors state there was a lot of editing and I felt I could really see it in this film that hindered more than helped it.-The Marvels has a lot of awkward and unimpressive elements that really tore into the experience they were hinting at in the first set of trailers.-while the edits give you that fast paced, escaping into a lot of fun and comedic moments, it really tore up the story, character involvement, and action in the grand scheme of things.-The origin stories and connecting points are forgettable, blink and you'll miss it moments, lacking that Marvel polish.-Obstacles that start as a set-up of being tough to crack are surprisingly easy to get over, and even the darker morale questions feel tagged on and bland.-One whole segment of the movie on a planet with water felt incredibly rushed, so much depth gone with very obvious transition struggles and an action scene that felt even more rushed than most.-And as for the other action moments, I feel these two lost some edge and suspense, perhaps even style from how much was left out, all too cram so much into this movie that feels like a launch point/wrap up/media launcher.-This dislike I feel is the worst part of this movie, for while it works to keep entertainment, the movie does take some serious hits in a complete story on its own and one that feels every element is needed.-Throw in that I feel Khan's story got chopped up enough, that the Marvels now feels like more Captain Marvel 2 is the better title.The VERDICT\nThe hate for this movie is a bit stronger than I think needed after seeing the film. While certainly not my favorite to come out of the gate, The Marvels holds a lot more to in terms of fun, fandom, and that entertainment complex than several other MCU adventures have been. I enjoyed the fast pace for the feel and drive, helping keep the comedy good, the plot moving, and the action having that superhero slam that the original phases mostly held for me. It's just a good time, and one that does not rely too much on the proceeding movies to enjoy, so you don't have to wait too much given they fill in the gaps. It's purely going to be mind-numbing entertainment and mostly escapes some of the other themes Marvel got caught up on. Yet, the movie's cuts, while entertaining, really did a number on the movie feeling entirely about the Marvels. Origin stories are highly reduced, impasses are surprisingly easy to get through, lots of shifting around to try to keep all pieces in the movie, an entire section feeling very rushed, and action that feels too short are all things that really feel incomplete to me. A director's cut is certainly needed for fans like me who want all these things extended upon, especially the forgettable villain that has promise, but just gets lost to the comedy and time constraints of this movie. Still, it's not the horrible piece others call it to be for me, but yet feels like there is still some organizational needs to helping get them back on track.My scores are:\nAction/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0\nMovie overall: 6.5-7.0."
