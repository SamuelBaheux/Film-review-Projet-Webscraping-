    "0": "This has entertaining moments, but the clichés are endless and the dialog is as wooden as it gets. The people giving this a 10/10 are either plants or... special. There was no character development, the scene setting was terrible, the capricious flip flop in the balance of power is laughable, and the terrible pacing (especially at the end) is amateurish. Again, there are definitely scenes that hold attention, but that's not enough to give this movie a high rating. My guess is Pierce accepted this role because he owed someone a favor, or he's going broke and needed the money. Either way, this was definitely a debit from his brand, not a credit to it.6/10.",
    "1": "Just give it a try for legendary JAMES CAAN final appearence,may his soul rest in peace...\nDespite have seen plenty of movies of this genre this one shines with its gangster nature of tired out & desperatly needs an exit but An eye for an eye rule among them does prevail so do the fate...\nPierce brosnan as usual does maintain his charisma & potrays perfectly with his attitude and the care towards his boss whose memory loss is handled with subtle & gentle care...\nMorena boccario is flawless and her beauty does some matured face reactions at close up shots...\n\"Betrayal is a funny thing and its very nature is to catch you unaware\"\n\"Be good to people who were good to you & so do to yourself\"\nAre the dialogues that Keeps u cool while watching\nOverall a simple yet fascinating take on gangster flick with a cause.",
    "2": "... typical of many Brosnan movies... slick-production and good looking younger women... always a 'Bond' of sorts, his movies kinda made for his persona... this one with a large body count and non stop action... fun-easy-viewing for most all of its ninety minute runtime... slightly more than half of IMDb raters giving it a '10'.. it's good, just-not that good, he's just got a very loyal following liking his style... and it's really for what it is, a production without obvious flaws... he keeps dreams flowing for older guys, now in his 70's working alongside attractive women in their 40's.. making it actually look possible, riding off into the sunset.",
    "3": "I saw Fast Charlie, starring Pierce Brosnan-Black Adam, the James Bond movies; Morena Baccarin-Gotham_tv, the Deadpool movies; Gbenga Akinnagbe-The Old Man_tv, Independence Day: Resurgence and James Caan-The Killer Elite_1975, the Godfather movies.In this action movie, Pierce plays a fixer; he solves problems, mostly for his boss of 33 years, James, but sometimes for others, when asked nicely. Sort of like, if Bond retired and became a fixer, just for the giggles and some extra spending money. Gbenga is one of those others and he asks Pierce to fix a situation for him. Pierce takes an accomplice-one of Gbenga's men-with him and the job goes badly, so Gbenga starts killing people. His men bungle the job on Pierce so Pierce finds Morena, an ex girlfriend of the botched job, and soon, everybody is trying to kill everybody else while Pierce is just trying to survive. There are several nods to Pierce's Bond role. In one scene, Pierce stands in front of a locker with the number 7 on it. In another, Pierce is looking in his emergency stash box for a weapon and some money and a Walther PPK is seen in the box. FYI: This is also the last role James Caan filmed before he passed away in 2022.It doesn't have a rating but there were some violence and language and it had a running time of 1 hour & 30 minutes.It was good enough that I would buy it on DVD.",
    "4": "Overall average action flick. Pretty cliched, with a medium to low budget, bellow average pretty forward story. Yet, it has Brosnan in it, who still pulls it off to look badassed with a gun. He sells the part terrifically. Seems to be in a pretty good shape still. Movie is average paced, nice to watch and definitely a fiest for Brosnan fans. It has below 6 rating but I'm all fairness it is more of a 6.5. Definitely watch and do enjoy........oh and it's a last movie of James Caan ;)...While watching this film you will keep thinking what were the producers thinking of getting rid of him as Bond. He was tailor made for the role...",
    "5": "This is a movie which goes down smooth like a well aged bottle of Scotch. It is the last film for Caan, literally a film legend. And Brosnan, Hollywood's \"Cary Grant\" of the 80s -- who did a great Bond film -- holds the camera well, and never gives you a chance to check your watch. That said, a film like this can never fully communicate to young viewers, those who have not BEEN THERE and DONE THAT. Young people can see the film ELVIS, but never actually experience Elvis.

    "6": "Charlie Swift (Pierce Brosnan) describes himself as a concierge for the Biloxi mob. He works directly for Stan Mullen (James Caan-last film) whose memory is slipping badly and Charlie must care for him. Charlie picks up a guy named Blade (Brennan Keel Cook) because he stabs people. A man named Rollo is the target. Rather than stab Rollo, Blade decides he would use an exploding donut which removes Rollo's head making identification difficult. Charlie, our fixer, contacts his ex-wife Marcie Kramer (Morena Baccarin) to provide a means of identification. This was done as a favor to Marcano Beggar (Gbenga Akinnagbe) who runs the New Orleans chapter. Without warning, Beaggar's men put the hit on Stan and his crew. Charlie is out for revenge.Pierce Brosnan does a better job as a southerner than Sean Connery did as a Russian submarine captain.

No sexy or nudity.",
    "7": "One of the few movies that is made as an action crime average-drama, but bears almost no suspense and thrill, making you nearly fall asleep in the middle if you have recently had a meal.Everything is around average, besides the photography and (very) good soundtrack and score. Are those alone enough for 'Fast Charlie' ? Of course not and it shows. Pierce Brosnan possesses an ever charisma even at his age, balancing comic and serious moments and handling his role quite nicely; on the down side we have Morena Baccarin's character Marcie who acts impossibly dry and uncharismatic, like she has gone through taxidermy job herself. The supporting cast, nothing special to talk about.Truthfully, I expected more from it, but it is what it is. Flowing scenes with or without bullet. The photography of Tuscany was more enthralling than the entire movie.Last appearance and role of James Caan who handled his role and script well.

    "8": "I have been waiting for a proper action movie tailored for Mr. Pierce Brosnan for a long time! I have to say it is a good story with a good cast and above all the sleek-looking Brosnan. I guess this is James Caan's final movie, he's still good in this film, too bad he passed away, he was a great actor and I am going to miss him. It's also good to see Morena Baccarin in this movie too, she is such a beautiful and talented actress. It is always fun to see an action movie with no cops involved. Is it a little bit John Wick-ish? I guess so. Even the mob has to follow rules otherwise we live with the animals. I also like the touch of love between Pierce and Morena. The one-dollar house in Tuscany Italy is a wonderful thought, maybe we should all get retired in Italy. Oh, after saying all the good stuff about this movie, will Mr. Pierce Brosnan cook me a wonderful Italian dinner?",
    "9": "In abysmally decrepit so-called thriller \"Fast Charlie\" elderly Mississippi mob enforcer Pierce Brosnan goes on a laughably implausible revenge spree when his crew (as intimidating as Brosnan - ie not at all) is hit by a rival. It sucks, despite the experience of those involved, like writer Richard Wenk whose cliché riddled screenplay is a hole-filled snooze-fest, or James Caan & Morena Baccarin in support who're clealy way past their primes (tho Sharon Gless' cameo is funny), Brosnan who can sure pick a turkey (despite excelling in \"The Last Rifleman\" recently), and director Phillip Noyce who pulled the whole cringe-worthy mess together. It's a turd. Flush it away.",
    "10": "I came into this movie thinking it would be a background noise to what I was really doing. Writing down awesome recipes. And it's quirky dialogue just grabbed my attention. Non of the cliche action movie dialogue. Just straight forward but polite back and forth interaction very well done between characters. Bronson has not lost his acting chops. Caan, just acted natural. There are few movies out there that the characters treat one another with respect even when they are out to do each other harm. Those types of movies just grab my attention and make me want to see them over and over again. If you want relaxing yet just can't walk away entertainment, this is one to see.",
    "11": "Charlie Swift (Pierce Brosnan) is the hitman fixer for mob boss Stan Mullen (James Caan). Stan's health has been declining and Charlie has covered for him. Charlie gets paired with an idiot to do a hit. It goes wrong and he falls for the mark's ex-wife Marcie Kramer (Morena Baccarin). The situation gets a lot worst when a rival gang goes to war.Bond is trying to be southern and it's weird. It's based on a novel so the characters are specific to the book. Still, I would have just made him Irish. This is a fine crime thriller with some local colors. I like the local colors, but Brosnan's non-local voice keeps bugging me. As for Caan who passed away in 2022, this is bittersweet. He does look frail which fits the character, but he still has the presence to be a mob boss. At least, it's nice to see him before he leaves us.",
    "12": "This movie is a effing blast! Brosnan totally reinvents himself; his role as Charlie is gritty yet charismatic. The chemistry with Morena Baccarin is electric, they really bring the characters to life. The cinematography is another high point, every shot is visually striking, giving the film a unique style. The pace is relentless, keeps you hooked till the end. It's a mystery why it's not in more cinemas, a film this good should be everywhere. Solid 10/10 as it does what it does damn near perfectly. Would watch again! On another note, there's something to be said for getting these older actors who are legends, they bring what could have been a lesser film, so much gravitas, couple that with the director of Patriot Games, Bone Collector and some of my other favourite thriller/action films, it's just a no brainer.",
    "13": "Honestly, it's pretty awesome Pierce Brosnan still has it, bringing a mix of suave and humor to the hitman role. The film's got this dark comedy vibe that I didn't expect but totally loved. It's like, it takes the crime genre but flips it with these hilarious moments. Brosnan and Morena Baccarin have this interesting chemistry, and the whole thing about him wanting to retire to Italy is pretty relatable. I mean, who doesn't dream of escaping sometimes? The action scenes are tight - not too overdone but still keep you on edge. Definitely a fun watch, especially if you're into movies that aren't just the same old action flick.",
    "14": "I feel like it really deserves more ratings than what it currently has. No CGI, straight comedy and creativity.Fine it aint John Wick type of vibe but it certainly is one of the best movies we got this year. Even the plot twists in it are so cool, nah this is really good.Charlie Swift (Pierce Brosnan) is one of the best out there and how he collaborated with Morrena was brilliant. Also its the only Hollwood movie i have watched without nudity or promoting weird sexual conducts and all. It can be a family watch though its got scenes with aggressive tones and words which may be a bit of a problem for children under 13.",
    "15": "No, it isn't. It still works somehow.These Irish f@kers - I mean Brosnan and Neeson - keep doing action movies into their seventies, and yet they are totally entertaining and enjoyable. How they do it, I have no idea. It certainly has to do with their acting skills and how well they know the genre itself. Also, with the choices they make when pick a screenplay and the director attached to it.This story goes on a very much Tarantinoesque trajectory, only this is more direct. Hilarious one liners are made during its span, and also it ends up to be a love story with hints along the way. It is Pierce Brosnan best outing since The November Man in the genre, for sure.Well done.",
    "16": "Pierce Brosnan in what could be his first outing as a type of mild John wick or equalizer style roll. Not as action packed as the afore mentioned, but not a bad character for Brosnan. Starts a bit slow as the story unfolds, give it time, then it moves along at a good pace that is very believable and the action is not too over the top. No questionable content, or nudity. Some foul language and quite a bit of gore and blood, a few twists and turns with a surprising ending. Not sure if this will ever have a sequel but could see one being made as a way of keeping the character alive. Great actors and story. Nice emotional part near the end how he takes care of his friend. Not for the squeamish as far as a few gore scenes, but otherwise a mild action movie. I would watch it again. Enjoy!",
    "17": "In 'Fast Charlie,' Pierce Brosnan's performance is a standout, bringing an exceptional depth to the character of Charlie, an aging hitman with a heart. Brosnan, with his ageless charm and experience, portrays a character who is ruthless yet caring, skillful yet vulnerable. His portrayal goes beyond the standard action hero archetype, bringing a sense of humanity and relatability to Charlie. Brosnan's subtle humor, combined with his emotional depth, particularly in scenes with Stan, his dementia-addled boss, adds a layer of complexity. This is not just another action role for Brosnan; it's a character study of a man caught in the twilight of his career, reflecting on his life choices and yearning for a different future. Also I've read people complaining about his accent, I don't see it, I think those people are just too used to 'Bond' Brosnan. I think he nailed it.",
    "18": "Really enjoyed this movie. Pierce Brosnan is his classy self with another understated performance. James Caan gives a final and almost touching performance and Morena Baccarin has great chemistry with Pierce. Just a nice fun movie that moves fast and keeps you entertained. Scenes of New Orleans and the Gulfport are compelling and the other cast members do a good job portraying the low life's in the area. Kind of reminded me of the characters in the Grisham book Boys from Biloxi. Pierce continues his track record of acting in movies we all love and while violent always have a soul. And you could tell James Caan knew this was his last movie and his character felt so real.",
    "19": "I saw the movie last night at a special screening in the Raphel Theater. Philip Noyce and Pierce Brosnan were there for a follow interview. The movie is superb. I was expecting an average low budget movie. It was the exact opposite. Don't assume anything. You'll enjoy every minute of it. The script is brilliant. In the interview after the show, Phillip Noyce pointed out that they had one individual that did the entire Music score. And it's well done. He plays 11 instruments....oh wait...13 instruments if you can believe that. You can check him out on Instagram. Phil Eisner. Just Google the movie score and it will pop up. You will appreciate it even more when you realize that they almost ran out of money several times while filming. The interview after the movie was fascinating. Pierce Brosnan is remarkably humble. Seems like a great guy.",
    "20": "Tacky storyline, few surprises and lacking the drive the creators think they managed.Sorry to say that this was disappointing. Not bad acting but the storieline, onliners, and the ambiance was nothing you haven't already seen.The story was pretty clear from the start. The seasoned fixer for the mob boss that still protects his \"absent father\" angainst the newbies that lack honor in the profession. Meeting the younger unfortshanant girl and they managed to to solve issues araising and ceasing the moment to pull the trigger on realizing their dreams of a better life and retaiering in a nother world, far, far away from their current, so they can start fresh, leaving old memories behind and creating a tranquil haven, sailing into the sunset.",
    "21": "I had to literally go hunting to find this film, when I finally found a cinema to watch it, the cinema said to me they were not going to show the film. But then the actress from the movie turned up with some friends and convinced them to play it which was pretty special! Good movie. Weird it's hard to see. Anyone know why?Really doesn't make sense. Pierce Brosnan is great. It's the late great James Caan's last film. I've been a big fan of Baccarin from Gotham days, so good to see her on screen next to these legends, she holds up really really well against them. Wanna see more of her. Go get behind this film, we need more like it and we need it in cinemas!",
    "22": "Fast Charlie is a fun smart movie with a cool vibe and plenty of southern charm. Charlie's character was fun to watch as he realizes that his life may need a drastic change, and his adventure has some unexpected twists and turns. He's a classy dude and when his world gets turned upside down, he engages in some much needed self reflection. I liked the southern influenced music which really complimented the story and action. There is a nice mix of orchestral, brass, and funk which reminds me of John Cleary or Dr. John sort of. Marcy does a great job of being a cool hip southern leading lady that really has some appeal as well. Certainly check this movie out.",
    "23": "It's not just some typical gangster movie. The romance part between Brosnan's Charlie and Baccarin's Marcie is kinda cool. It's not all in-your-face; it's chill but deep. They've got this vibe, you know, where it's more about looks and small moments than just being all over each other. Brosnan and Baccarin totally nail it, making it feel real and not just some movie romance.This also seemed to be shot with more artistic integrity than your average gangster film, it felt like it was shot with love.It's a fresh take on love in a movie where you'd expect more action than heart. Definitely worth a watch if you're into films that aren't just about action but have something more.",
    "24": "You are not supposed to find tenderness and quiet dignity in a gangster movie. Hell, for that matter, unless you are of the life, you shouldn't see yourself in a gangster movie, and yet the gift of FAST CHARLIE is you will find great tenderness and dignity in the film, and find yourself front and center in the film around a kitchen table.Let me back up.The Charlie of the title is Charlie Swift, played by Pierce Brosnan. Unless you have lived under a rock for forty years, you know this man is the dictionary definition of tenderness and quiet dignity. He acts when he plays a hitman, and he does so here with brilliance. Like a diamond (also known for its brilliance) Charlie's role as a fixer has many facets, one of which is a hit man. There is a sharp, cold, precision to how Charlie kills, swift even, and no, you don't want to see him a suit in the morning. Just ask a not so sharp fellow who thinks his name is Blade, but really is better to suited to being a donut. Oh wait, you can't, Donut is dead.Donut's death, and the death of the man Donut and Charlie were hired to kill is what drives the plot of FAST CHARLIE but the film itself exists in the complicated and multifaceted space that we call humanity.It is another facet of Charlie, that of a caregiver, that we the audience find ourselves in the film. We have been at those birthday parties celebrating the ringleader of our crew. We have stood around kitchen tables figuring out how to help take care of someone we love. We have asked someone out on a date and instantly cringed as our heart circumvents our mouths. We may dream of being the badass Charlie is; we are the person he is.We are also Marcie, played with equal diamond like composition by Morena Baccarin. She lives her life fully, and her life is full of a past that almost prevents her future. Almost. Luckily fate crafts a new ending for her just as deserved and triumphant as the expressions she creates on the animals she returns to hunters. The dearly departed bare expressions that turn the predator into prey, haunting the hunters every time they look at their kill.We are also in nearly every other character in Fast Charlie: the sharp tongued and well - proportioned - mother in law that is gifted to us by Sharon Gless, the moments where we think only of ourselves and pay the price (as Benny does), and in the moments where rise above ourselves and take care of each other (see Giselle and Milt and Paulie).And most of all we will find ourselves in James Caan's final act of love for his audience, his portrayal of Stan, the leader of Charlie's crew. Here too we find a very complicated man, but one who understands ultimately to take care of those who are and could be good to you. (Beggar's fall is that Stan knows Beggar will be good to and for no one.)In their moments on screen together Brosnan and Caan bring a love to us that we very rarely see or feel. That alone should have gotten them nominated for something, and I hope it still might yet.Caan's Stan echos THE GODFATHER somewhat in all the quiet dignity that Brando tried to give us, and warms it up with humor and true grace.Are any of these characters saints? Hell no, but that is why FAST CHARLIE works. In this brisk film, Philip Noyce has managed to bring the everyday into a world that is far from common. It is not a perfect film but will rank high in the cannon of its stars and director.",
    "25": "I really enjoyed seeing all these excellent actors in a crime story with both humor and wit. I saw it in a theater so I really appreciated the 90-minute length. The ever-handsome Brosnan made it easy to forgive his sketchy Southern accent. His devoted caring for Caan's character and longing for a Tuscany retirement (if only the right person were with him; enter lovely Morena Baccarin's Marcie) made him an endearing hitman. I stayed engaged and also liked the music. I'm no film buff, but Phillip Noyce's skill is apparent, as is that of his crew. I think most people would leave the theater smiling.",
    "26": "I love action movies that have fun. This movie has a lot of fun. Killer kill scenes. Funny actors being stupid when they are trying to be menacing. It's got some really creepy locations too. Car cemetery is extra creepy. Pierce Brosnan has a cool accent in this one too. He's doing Biloxi which most people have probably never heard in real life so they are gonna think it's weird but take it from someone from the south, he nails it. All the actors crush. The Freak guy is really weird and skin crawly. Love all the odd stuff too like the girl being a taxidermist and haunting people with their stuffed animals is awesome. Great car stunts and gore here too and also made me wanna to go to New Orleans and drink all weekend. Really great movie.",
    "27": "Fast Charlie directed by Philip Noyce and based on a novel by Victor Gischler, is a film that treads well-worn turf with a refreshing twist. Pierce Brosnan plays Charlie Swift, a Biloxi-based mob operative with a Southern charm that's surprisingly endearing. The movie opens with Charlie in a junkyard, reflecting on his life, setting the tone for a story that's about much more than mob cliches. His task to take out a guy named Rollo leads to an intriguing plot involving Charlie's boss Stan, who's poignantly portrayed by James Caan in his last film role, and a young up-and-comer named Beggar. The film is characterized by dryly funny mayhem reminiscent of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen, and Brosnan's interaction with Morena Baccarin's character, Marcie, adds a slyly winning dynamic. The casting significantly contributes to the film's appeal, transforming familiar genre situations into a source of pleasure. This manages to be an entertaining evening's watch, combining action and humor with a satisfying conclusion .",
    "28": "This flick really delivers something different. Brosnan's portrayal of Charlie is more than just a mob guy; he brings a surprising depth with a Southern twist that's pretty engaging. The storyline weaves classic mob drama with unexpected turns, keeping it interesting throughout. The balance of action and humor is spot on, making it enjoyable without being over the top. Brosnan and Baccarin have this great dynamic, adding a cool layer to the film. And James Caan, in his final role, brings a touching depth to the story. It's a great mix of laughs, action, and some genuine emotional moments, making it a perfect pick for a movie night that's not just about explosions and chases.",
    "29": "I have to say: I really liked this movie. Despite the theme itself being a bit cliche, the way the movie is told and the subtleties kept the movie engaging without turning into a total cliche. For example, it would've been really easy for the former 007 get physical with Marcie (payed extremely well by Morena Baccarin), but instead they didn't. Marcie keeps it all inside and Charlie never crosses the line.In addition, the movie strikes a perfect blend of comedy, dept (as in Charlie's caring for Stan and his code of honor), as well as action -- not an easy thing to do. In fact, the action is surprisingly good for a movie without the fanfare and budget with all other we've seen over and over again.",
    "30": "Really enjoyed this touching love story with a high body count. The story, adapted from the book by Victor Gischler kept me riveted and the acting is divine. Every actor superbly cast and directed. Pierce Branson is cool and calm amongst the speed and clip that Noyce keeps the plot going at, he has been directing fun, interesting films for many decades and I am glad he is still at it. This film shows how much he enjoys the art and craft of cinema. From the first hit to the last I couldn't stop watching, its filled with original and unusual moments. I highly recommend seeing this one on the big screen when it comes out later this year.",
    "31": "As a film student, watching \"Fast Charlie\" was a fascinating experience. Philip Noyce's direction brings a fresh perspective to the mob genre, combining classic elements with innovative storytelling. Pierce Brosnan, as Charlie, displays a nuanced performance that transcends his usual roles, showing versatility and depth. The script, adapted from Victor Gischler's novel, balances well-worn mob tropes with witty, Elmore Leonard-style dialogue. The cinematography stands out, offering a stylish yet gritty look that complements the narrative's tone. James Caan, in his final role, adds a poignant layer, showcasing the film's ability to blend toughness with emotional depth. The film is a commendable blend of action, humor, and heart, making it a standout project in contemporary cinema.",
    "32": "Charlie Swift (Pierce Brosnan) is a former Marine turned fixer for the crime syndicate in Biloxi, Mississippi that holds together even in the face of its aging head Stan Mullen's (James Caan) diminishing mental faculties. Following a hit on a low level crook named Rollo on behalf of New Orleans crime boss Beggar (Gbenga Akinnagbe), Beggar soon stages an attack that leaves most of the Biloxi crew dead. Charlie teams up with Rollo's ex Marcie (Morenca Baccarin) to find some evidence on Beggar he'd stashed away in order to take down Beggar and avenge his crew.Fast Charlie is an adaptation of the 2001 crime novel Gun Monkeys by Victor Gischler. Attempts had been made as far back as 2009 to adapt the novel to film when director Ryuhei Kitamura was slated to direct from a script by Lee Goldberg, but fell into development hell until producer Dan Grodnik acquired the project and resurrected it as a directing vehicle for Phillip Noyce with Richard Wenk of the Denzel Washington Equalizer films writing the script. Now unceremoniously released to on-demand, one would be forgiven for thinking this was throwaway action fodder built around a name cast. While Fast Charlie does hit upon many of the touchstones of the hitman adjacent action genre, it has a solid against type performance from Brosnan and a setting that distinguishes it from the more typical urban settings of this type of film.While I had reservations about Pierce Brosnan playing a southern Fixer for the Biloxi mafia, he does a pretty good job of taking on the accent and for the most part I was able to buy Brosnan as a hard edged aging fixer for a low level criminal enterprise. Despite now being in his 70s Brosnan still exudes strong charisma and charm and handles himself well enough in the action beats that Phillip Noyce knows how to stage. While the movie does include romantic subtext between Morena Baccarin's Marcie and Brosnan's Charlie (complete with a noticeable if not overtly objectionable age gap) at least Marcie is able to hold her own as a reasonably compelling character. James Caan is decent as the aging mob boss Stan Mullen in his final role, but as the character is in the waning years of his life Caan doesn't really get to do much except act confused and the fact he seems like he's still central to the Biloxi mafia's operations is never really addressed in how this is all working and is nebulously defined at best.This really goes into the biggest weakness of Fast Charlie in that it feels like its noir story isn't fully developed and squanders its unique setting for a conventional revenge narrative. While the movie's perfectly serviceable on that front, the movie's opening with its quirky characterization of a man named \"Blade\" who beheads a guy with a blasting cap loaded donut or the need to Identify an assassination target via a tattoo on his posterior feel like remnants from a quirkier more darkly comic material that Noyce and Wenk have decided to play more straight. I'll admit I don't know a lot about Victor Gischler, but from what I've seen it looks like he's known for adding humor to his crime stories and given Noyce is more known for straight action/thrillers with no comedy to his name I really have to wonder if Wenk and Noyce were the right team to tackle this material.As a performance piece for Pierce Brosnan, his central performance as Charlie Swift makes the movie worth a one time viewing in my opinion (when it hits whatever streaming service you happen to already be a member of) and it has more ambition and personality than your average VOD action thriller of this type. With that said there's moments where the original quirkiness and absurdity of the original premise shine through and they feel somewhat at odds with the direction Noyce and Wenk wanted to take this material and story elements such as how the Biloxi mafia continues to operate with its head's declining faculties feel underdeveloped and could've served as a movie unto themselves. A decent enough time killer that feels like it could've been much more.",
    "33": "As mercurial and suave as ever, Pierce Brosnan sails through this movie with all his old charm from his heydays, although slightly stiffer in the joints here and there. He still has it all - the charm, the calm, the cool and the comedy. The Bond in him will never die and the allure of his secret service persona is what drives his audience for moreWhat a nice surprise to see Deadpool's wife in such a convincing role here as Marcie the taxidermist. Great to see Morena Baccarin's calming effect on the storyline and keeping some suspense on the griller. The two leads balanced and played off one another superbly in this movieAs for the rest, it is the normal action packed killing-off-the-baddies, but done in a professional Bond way... not the gory mass demolition of gangsters we sometimes see. Also with a good dash of humor, which drowns out any possible unwanted gore, but the little gore that is there is mostly a chuckle and a grinAs for getting on, Pierce Brosnan as the senior lead in the movie somehow bows to a 100-year old James Caan in his last movie before his death, which was a bit strange...... Charlie's presence in the movie is strong enough to draw the audience into a dominant and commanding lead.... not needing a superseding role. RIP Mr CaanOn another note : WHY can producers and directors not leave (foreign) actors to be themselves. Naturally. If you want someone to have an accent like the Deep South, then get an actor from there. You cannot take a (British) actor and make the sound like a Boloxian! It is terrible. The worst one I think was Daniel Craig as a Texan in Knives Out. THAT was badBack to Charlie : fun, light hearted, pacey and entertaining. Good action with a surreptitious streak, some tongue-in-cheek chuckles and good for an evening's watch. Can pass for a 7/10 without the nostalgia.",
    "34": "Pierce Brosnan (the former James Bond) and James Caan (The Godfather) have both rightfully earned their huge success in acting. But this movie is so cheaply made that it was one big disappointment to watch both those acting legends star in it.The bad: it's made on a budget. And it really shows! Cheap looking photography. Mediocre supporting actors, who unfortunately get a lot of screentime.But what's most disappointing is that this story is totally void of any real suspense or thrill. Not terribly bad, but quite uneventful and tedious...NO action. NO suspense. NO good jokes. What's left?I hope that Pierce Brosnan hasnt run on lower financial grounds, because I have seen him starring in several cheaply made B-movies lately which are just not worthy of his great stature as an actor.",
    "35": "An excellent Indie film created on a very small budget that pulls you in. Noyce makes the most of 90 minutes - inventive action, skillful cinematography, a very believable screen play with mature characters, supported by excellent performances from Brosnan, Baccarin, and Caan. All of the modest budget is on the screen. This film offers so much more than the usual \"aging hitman out for revenge\" tropes. Even the May/December romance is quietly developed and believable. Noyce deserves nominations as well as the three leads. This film makes an interesting trilogy when combined with The Matador and The November Man. Each was filmed 10 years apart and demonstrates the progression of Brosnan's interpretation of the professional hitman as he ages. Each script, while definitely an action film with a high kill rate is unique. Each also focuses on the protagonist's ability or inability to form relationships. Fast Charlie offers hope that a professional hitman can leave the life behind for a new beginning. There's talk of a sequel - will the Italian Mafia allow Charlie to just walk away, or will they seek him out? Will Charlie and Marcie be able to build a life together despite their pasts and age difference? Perhaps Charlie will explore his culinary skills while renovating a Tuscan villa. As for Marcie, there will obviously be work available for an experienced taxidermist with an endless supply of duct tape.",
    "36": "Can Pierce Brosnan still put it off? Well, in short - yes. He managed to pull of a character that is seasoned, but not geriatric. His chemistry with the supporting actress Morena Baccarin is quite good, although writers had to work around the age difference they managed to pull it off quite successfully.\"Fast Charlie\" is about an aging fixer, Charlie Swift, that did not even lose one beat of professionalism and has to deal with a rival gang that is trying to take over the \"old gang\" territory, complete with loyal and betraying characters alongside the unavoidable romance.I also like the humor in this film, or rather I should say - sarcasm. I would not color this film as comedy, but it does take itself lightly in a few different spots, which is a nice touch. It makes it into a very enjoyable crime / action feature to pass an evening with, but a restart of James Bond series - it is not.My biggest grime with this movie is near the end at the final showdown that was a bit anticlimactic and made little sense. My exact score: 68 / 100, Guide: Mild violence, several bloody scenes, no nudity, no cuss-words.",
    "37": "Rating: 1/10 I rated 2/10 for 007Fast Charlie, starring Pierce Brosnan, is a cinematic disaster that left me questioning why I wasted precious time on this lackluster film. The story is an incoherent mess, with no clear direction or purpose. It's as if the writers threw a bunch of random scenes together and hoped it would somehow form a cohesive narrative.The movie's biggest flaw is its complete lack of a coherent storyline. The plot meanders aimlessly, with no clear connection between scenes. It's as if the filmmakers themselves were unsure of what story they were trying to tell. Fast Charlie lacks any meaningful character development, leaving me detached and uninvested in the fate of the characters.Can you explain how is it she give im the bag with the evidance in it to take care of it while he is trying to disable a band of nine and then the number 1 guy is the only one sweaty\ni mean AI couldn't generae a story this bad.S*****it sorry but N Gooood\nIt's bellow BADI really Like Pierce movies (007's, the November Man. The Thomas Crown Affair.... and many more.Sorry to those who rated 10/10.",
    "38": "\"Fast Charlie\" unfortunately falls short of delivering an engaging cinematic experience. The film features a noticeable age gap in the love story between Pierce Brosnan and Morena Baccarin, which is handled with a lack of sensitivity and depth. This element of the plot feels outdated and fails to add any meaningful dimension to their relationship.Moreover, the film struggles significantly in the humor department. Despite having opportunities to inject wit or charm, it remains steadfastly serious, missing chances to lighten the mood or endear the characters to the audience. This absence of humor makes the movie feel heavier and less enjoyable than it could have been.Another major drawback of \"Fast Charlie\" is its lack of originality. The plot treads familiar ground, relying on tired and predictable storylines that offer little in the way of surprise or innovation. The narrative feels like a rehash of numerous other action movies, lacking a unique voice or a new perspective to distinguish it from its predecessors.In conclusion, \"Fast Charlie\" is a disappointing effort that suffers from an awkward age-gap romance, a serious lack of humor, and an all-too-familiar plot. The film fails to captivate or provide a fresh take on the genre, making it a forgettable addition to Pierce Brosnan's filmography.",
    "39": "It was mid-decent, mob world wasn't portrayed nearly as realistic it didn't make a formidable impact but okay. I wasted my time probably but it didn't suck big time like those B-grade movies that make you yawn after 20min in with a cringey feeling on your face, it held itself with good enough flow. Nice punchlines by Brosnan, good to see he can act better than most actors still at the same age. Lukewarm action film with handful exciting moments, nothing more than a tea-time film you play because you couldn't find anything better, even the inside-car scenes felt like they were shot in a studio rather than in an actual moving car (character outline was easy to notice for me at least but concealed well).I wanted to give it 5.9 honestly because I didn't feel entertained like I do after watching many of those 6/10 good flicks, I rather felt like I maybe wasted my time getting over excited seeing Pierce Brosnan in lead. But like I said earlier it wasn't 'too' bad so I can be little generous here and push the rating to whole 6. Just keep your expectations low folks if you watch this. Cheers!",
    "40": "This isn't your everyday action film - it's a whole new level of cool. Pierce Brosnan, who we all know as the debonair Bond, totally flips the script here. He plays this mob fixer named Charlie, and he's got this Southern twang that's oddly endearing. I mean, it's a side of Brosnan I never knew I needed to see, but now I can't get enough!The film opens with this moody, intense scene that perfectly sets the stage for what's to come. It's a mix of tough action sequences and these really touching, human moments. Brosnan's performance is nuanced and grounded, making you feel every bit of his character's journey.And then there's Morena Baccarin, who absolutely shines as Marcie. Her character's witty and strong, and the way she interacts with Brosnan is just spot on. Their dynamic brings a lot of heart to the film. Also, James Caan's portrayal of Stan, Charlie's boss struggling with Alzheimer's, adds a poignant layer to the narrative. Genuine question though, how much of that was acting, and how much of it was real? I mean Caan died shortly after, food for thought.The film's got this clever, dry humor that reminds me of Elmore Leonard's work. There's a scene where Charlie gives Marcie a dead fox to stuff, and their exchange is just hilarious. The movie balances these lighter moments with high-stakes action so well.I'm genuinely surprised that \"Fast Charlie\" hasn't had more buzz, I mean I've barely heard about it and it's such a standout film, blending classic mob drama elements with a modern, quirky twist. The casting is spot-on, the storytelling is engaging, and the action is thrilling. If you love films that mix humor, action, and great character development, you've got to see this one. Brosnan and Baccarin really bring their A-game. This movie deserves way more attention!",
    "41": "The supporting cast in 'Fast Charlie' brings a rich diversity to the film, complementing Brosnan's performance and enhancing the narrative. Morena Baccarin as Marcie is a standout, delivering a performance that is both strong and vulnerable. Her character, an embittered ex-wife and professional taxidermist, brings an unusual dynamic to her interactions with Charlie. Baccarin portrays Marcie with a sense of independence and resilience, making her a compelling character in her own right. The relationship between Charlie and Marcie develops subtly throughout the film, offering a romantic subplot that is both unexpected and well-executed.James Caan's final screen appearance as Stan is poignant and impactful. His portrayal of a gang boss with dementia is both touching and authentic, adding an emotional depth to the film. The relationship between Charlie and Stan is heartwarming, showcasing a side of Charlie that is caring and protective. The supporting characters, including Gbenga Akinnagbe as the rival gangster Beggar and the various members of Stan's gang, add layers to the story, each bringing their unique flair to the film. The dynamics between these characters create a rich tapestry of interactions, enhancing the narrative and making the world of 'Fast Charlie' feel lived-in and real. The film does an excellent job of fleshing out its characters, making them more than just plot devices. This attention to character development is one of the strengths of 'Fast Charlie,' elevating it above typical genre fare. REally perplexing why this seems to have had no promotion or atleast a theatrical push.",
    "42": "Oh my oh my how I love seeing fantastic actors turn in fresh and top notch performances. Especially when the movie is this good. On paper it sounds like a standard Elmore Leonard knockoff, but don't let that fool you. The aging hitman/fixer reaping vengeance others have sowed is a familiar tale but Fast Charlie subverts all the tropes and turns them into fresh new takes. The New Orleans and Biloxi settings are so authentic you sweat. James Caan as the old crime boss on his way out is exceptional casting and a killer, pun-intended, role for a master like Caan to have as his final performance. And Morena Baccarin once again punches cliche'd female characters in the nuts and we actually get to watch a real relationship develop, regrets and all.The movie is almost a comedy, definitely a dark one, and had me and the rest of the audience cackle laughing at so many parts I even saw people high five each other after a hilarious and gruesome moment that, let's just say, will make you not want to drink sodas in your car for a very long time. It's action, it's hilarious, it's even touching. And I'm including the scenes with Charlie and his dementia encroaching boss Stan.The music! Awesome all around, and the movie doesn't do that end it 20 times so the audience doesn't even care anymore thing that so many films do nowadays. It's 90 minutes of fast, fun, filmmaking. The director Phillip Noyce did Patriot Games and Salt too AND The Bone Collector! So he definitely knows how to tell a fun action flick. This one has a heart and I am here for more films like this. Or even if they did a series on Netflix or something, I'd totally binge that.100 stars!",
    "43": "Recently, I had the pleasure of watching 'Fast Charlie,' and what struck me most was the artistry in its cinematography, a rare find in this genre. Typically, crime thrillers and action movies prioritize fast-paced scenes and explosive visuals. However, 'Fast Charlie' breaks this mold, offering a visual experience that's both elegant and expressive.The film's cinematographer crafts each frame with a keen eye for detail, using lighting and composition to elevate the storytelling. There's a certain grittiness that you'd expect from a crime drama, but it's balanced with moments of visual poetry. The use of shadows and light plays a significant role, creating an atmosphere that's moody and immersive. In scenes where tension runs high, the camera work is particularly noteworthy, employing unconventional angles and movements that add to the suspense without resorting to common action movie clichés.One of the most striking aspects is how the film captures the essence of its setting. The Mississippi backdrop is not just a location; it becomes a character in itself, thanks to the cinematography. The color palette used throughout the film adds to this, with rich, earthy tones that give a sense of place and time. This attention to visual storytelling makes 'Fast Charlie' stand out from its peers.Moreover, the film's action sequences are shot in a way that's both dynamic and artistic. Instead of relying solely on rapid cuts and shaky cam, which can often be disorienting, the film opts for clearer, more composed shots that allow the audience to fully engage with the action. This approach not only makes the action scenes more enjoyable but also aligns with the film's overall aesthetic, creating a cohesive visual experience.In conclusion, 'Fast Charlie' is a testament to how cinematography can enhance the narrative of a crime thriller, making it not just a story to be followed, but an artful experience to be appreciated. For those who admire cinematography that goes beyond the conventional, this film is a must-watch.",
    "44": "Alright, so \"Fast Charlie\" isn't just some deep and intense gangster flick. It's got its share of laughs too, especially those opening scenes with 'Donut.' Man, those parts are hilarious! Brosnan's Charlie and this character Donut - their dynamic is comedy gold. Donut's this kinda goofy guy, and the way Charlie deals with him, it's like a blend of frustration and amusement. It sets up the tone of the movie perfectly, showing you it's not just about the tough gangster life; there's room for some humor too.And the rest of the movie keeps up with this vibe. Brosnan's character isn't just about being macho; he's got this wry sense of humor that makes the film more relatable. The action and the drama are there, but it's the lighter moments, like with Donut, that add a different flavor to the story.The cinematography and the soundtrack also play into this. They bring out the contrasts in the film - the tough and the tender, the serious and the funny. It's not just visually appealing; it's storytelling through the camera.\"Fast Charlie\" is a great watch for anyone who loves a good mix of action, humor, and story. Brosnan and Baccarin are great, but it's also the supporting characters add an extra layer of entertainment. It's not your typical gangster film; it's got depth, fantastic acting, and a good few laughs.",
    "45": "'Fast Charlie' distinguishes itself in the crime drama genre through its unique blend of dark humor and a tight, well-written script by Richard Wenk. The film echoes the narrative style of Elmore Leonard, known for combining humor with crime storytelling. Wenk's script is sharp, witty, and well-paced, preventing the film from becoming overly dark despite its graphic content. The dialogue is smart, with quips and one-liners that add a light-hearted touch to the tense moments. This balance of humor and action is a difficult feat, which Wenk manages with skill, making 'Fast Charlie' a standout in its genre.The humor is not just in the dialogue but also in the situational comedy that arises from the absurdity of the film's circumstances. For instance, the scene where Charlie finds Marcie with the bodies of two would-be assassins is both dark and humorous. The film's ability to maintain this balance without diminishing the gravity of its crime thriller elements is commendable. The comedic moments are natural and well-timed, providing a respite from the high-stakes action. Wenk's script.",
    "46": "Okay so just dove into 'Fast Charlie' and man, I've gotta talk about it! This isn't your typical review, just me, a movie buff, spilling why I'm all hyped up about this flick. I'm throwing down a solid 10/10 for this one, and here's the real talk on why.First up, Pierce Brosnan is in this, yeah, the Bond guy, but forget that because he's serving up something different. He's playing this cool chef who's also a mob fixer. Brosnan's just nailing it, giving us this vibe that's so much more than the smooth spy we know him for. It's like he's got layers now, you know?Then there's Morena Baccarin. She's straight-up fire in this. Her character Marcie isn't just there for the looks; she's tough, smart, and matches Brosnan beat for beat. Their chemistry is the kind you don't just see, you feel it. It's not just flirty stuff; it's like watching two pros throwing down in a game of who's got the sharpest wit.Warwick Thornton, the cinematographer, is a genius, legit. The way he shoots the scenes, it's like every frame could be a poster on your wall. Sometimes the colors and the lights are so intense, you're not just watching, you're there.The music in this? It's not just background noise; it's got its own pulse. It's like the beats know exactly what's going on in the scene and it just amplifies everything - the tension, the drama, the whole shebang.The writing is pretty tight too. It's like they've got the best bits of those old crime novels, but with a twist that's all fresh. It's smart, it's snappy, and it doesn't get all lost in trying to be too clever. It's got that old-school gangster charm with a fresh-off-the-boat kind of cool.But here's the thing that's got me scratching my head - why the heck isn't 'Fast Charlie' playing in more theaters? It's like finding a hidden gem that you want to show off, but it's tucked away. This movie's got all the goods to be a big-screen hit, but it's playing hide and seek with the cinemas.Seriously, 'Fast Charlie' is a blast. It's like a love letter to those classic mob movies but written in today's ink. You get the action, the style, the laughs, and a couple of leads who can actually act. It's got that thing where you're glued to your seat, not because you have to see what happens next, but because you're just having too good a time.",
    "47": "Fast Charlie is a gangster film like no other, breaking the mold with its tenderness and depth. The film's emotional core lies in the unexpected gentleness of its narrative, particularly in the bond between Charlie (Pierce Brosnan) and his boss Stan (James Caan). Their loyalty and affection showcase a softer side of the genre, rarely seen in mob dramas. Similarly, the burgeoning love story, blossoming without even a single kiss, adds a poignant layer to the narrative.Warwick Thornton's cinematography elevates this sentiment, capturing the essence of the story through beautiful, non-traditional shots that stand apart from typical gangster films. The visual storytelling is both elegant and evocative, bringing a new aesthetic to a familiar genre.Complementing this is the film's score, which masterfully underscores the narrative's progression. The opening upbeat tracks draw you in, setting the stage for the story, while the emotional beats towards the end mirror the depth and complexity of the characters' journeys. The music enhances the film's tender moments, adding a layer of richness to the storytelling.\"Fast Charlie\" is a refreshing take on the gangster genre, blending action with unexpected warmth and beauty. It's a testament to the versatility of the genre and the power of storytelling that can evoke a wide range of emotions.",
    "48": "Fast Charlie is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that takes you on an excursion through the scenic South.The cinematography is a visual delight, capturing the essence of the South with authenticity and style. The music is a blend of styles that is both festive and urgent at the right time.The actors deliver the characters as any pro would. Pierce Brosnan's voice in the Louisiana drawl is like music and he nailed that accent. I enjoyed the chemistry he had with Morena Baccarin and as the story developed, it was great to see the unexpected romance that developed between their characters. As for Baccarin, she is graceful and fearless, a compelling combination for a mob wife. Gbenga Akinnagbe is a brilliant actor and nailed his portrayal of Beggar down to a T.The action kept me on the edge of my seat and the humour is pure Southern charm. You keep wondering how it plays out. What you don't see coming are the twists in the plot.The writing was witty and filled with heart and humour. My favourite scene was the monologue in the New Orleans hideout where Charlie talks about his relationship with his father and some of the rough lessons he learned growing up. It was moving and the emotions were authentic.The director's attention to detail shines through. The pacing is dynamic, seamlessly shifting between heart-pounding action sequences and moments of genuine emotion.",
    "49": "I just saw \"Fast Charlie,\" and honestly, it's not your typical gangster movie. What struck me most is its emotional depth and sensitivity. The film explores themes like loyalty, friendship, and love in a way that's unusually soft for this genre. Pierce Brosnan's Charlie is not just another tough mobster; he's portrayed with layers of complexity and vulnerability.There's a real emphasis on the internal struggles of the characters, which is refreshing. Scenes that could have been just about conflict or action are instead imbued with emotion and meaning. The relationships, especially between Charlie and his boss Stan, are handled with care, showing a side of loyalty and devotion that's rare in gangster films.Moreover, the way the love story is woven in is subtle yet powerful. It's not the usual action-packed, fast-paced romance. Instead, it unfolds gently, offering a poignant counterpoint to the film's darker elements. This thoughtful approach extends to the cinematography and score, which beautifully underscore the film's sensitive treatment of its characters and themes.\"Fast Charlie\" truly stands out for its ability to balance the typical toughness of a mob story with a heart and soul that resonates on a deeper level. It's a testament to the film's nuanced storytelling and strong performances, making it a unique and compelling watch in the genre.",
    "50": "\"Fast Charlie\" is a movie that hits the mark on several fronts, making it an exceptional watch. The standout aspect for me is the cinematography by Warwick Thornton. The visuals are stunning, capturing the essence of the locations and the tense atmosphere of the story. It's not just about the action scenes; even the quieter moments are shot beautifully, adding depth to the film.Then there's the storyline. Adapted from a novel by Victor Gischler, the script by Richard Wenk weaves a tale that's both familiar in its mob themes and fresh in its execution. It's a compelling mix of action, character development, and clever plot twists.Pierce Brosnan's portrayal of Charlie is another high point. He brings a blend of ruggedness and charm to the character, proving that there's plenty of range beyond his iconic Bond role.

Each character, from Charlie's loyal boss Stan to the ambitious rival Beggar, adds their unique flavor to the story. The film does a great job of developing these characters, giving them their moments to shine.Lastly, the film's pacing is just right. It balances the fast-paced action sequences with slower, more introspective scenes, keeping you engaged without feeling rushed.Overall, \"Fast Charlie\" is a film that delivers on multiple levels - visually arresting, well-acted, and smartly written. It's a refreshing take on the gangster genre that doesn't just rely on action but also focuses on story and character development.",
    "51": "This absolutely rocks! It's a thrilling ride from start to finish. Brosnan, as Charlie, is phenomenal - he brings this raw, magnetic energy that just lights up the screen. His performance is nuanced and powerful, really showing his range as an actor. And the action? It's top-tier, with some of the most intense and well-choreographed sequences I've seen in a while.The storytelling here is also top-notch.

Every frame is meticulously crafted, from the gritty streets to the intense action scenes. It adds so much to the film's overall feel and atmosphere. The soundtrack deserves a mention too. It's perfectly in sync with the film's mood, enhancing both the tension and the drama.The supporting cast is stellar, each bringing their A-game and adding depth to the narrative.
