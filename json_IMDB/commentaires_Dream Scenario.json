    "0": "Quick Review: My biggest pet peeve in films is dream sequences (I don't even love 'Inception' - don't hurt me). However the way they are done in 'Dream Scenario' was perfect. This film was a blast.Talk about getting everything out of a concept. The movie starts and you think, okay this is a lot of fun, but where are they going to go from here? Have no fear, they have plenty of tricks up their sleeves and the wild ride continues throughout.The film is hilarious. It contained some of the biggest theatre laughs I've heard in a long time. But it's more than that too. It actually gets quite touching and sad and has some real thought-provoking stuff going on. This was an excellent film. 8/10.",
    "1": "Nick Cage goes completely bonkers again with Dream Scenario. Similar to Adaptation or The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent ,Cage plays a man who needs everyone to know how smart he is in a way that makes him unlikeable slightly, which makes it interesting when life happens to him and the world starts to intergrade him into their dreams for no known reason and it takes an unfair turn that gives a vivid reflection on culture and social media if you ask me.It was an eye opener that made me laugh out loud because the metaphor on social commentary was just so dead on.Greatest Nicolas Cage movie of the year and Reinfeld came out this same year (along with a lot of other Nicolas Cage movies actually)",
    "2": "So, having heard nothing about this film, never mind seeing a trailer or preview for it, I went into this one blind with only the synopsis to go by.The film stars Nicolas Cage as a hapless family man who finds his life turned upside down when millions of strangers suddenly start seeing him in their dreams. When his nighttime appearances take a nightmarish & sinister turn, Paul is forced to navigate his newfound stardom.I found the film to be bizarre. I'm still right now trying to process what I watched. It was pretty engaging despite being dragged out in places & kept you wanting to know more & why the main lead was being dreamed about & of course, why the dreams about him turn sinister & violent.The film's story & concept is definitely unique & did remind me (& is funnily enough parodied here) like A Nightmare On Elm Street. The horror aspects (what little there was) were good & there's some awkward, yet funny & humourous scenes to be had.What annoyed me about the film was the lack of explanation as to why people were dreaming about Paul Matthews & of course why the dreams turned sour.Moreover, the unlike-ability of the characters in the film, the family members, the students, his friends & others treating him like he was a criminal. Couldn't these people in the film tell the difference between fantasy & reality? Were they that gullible & dumb to not know the difference? The way he was treated in the film really made me feel sorry for the guy. It was both annoying & hard to watch to be honest. Not to mention they way they blamed him for something that was completely out of his control. Unbelievable.The film itself was pretty depressing in a lot of areas & towards the end we didn't get any reconciliation of the characters that treated him badly & continued to blame him for the nightmares they were having. The film did have a decent runtime of 1 hour & 36 minutes (96 minutes) & not bad pacing despite being sluggish in areas.Overall, it's a mixed bag this one. There's some good points & bad. It's an out there type of film which is neither good or bad, but ok & bizarre. Judge for yourself when you come to see it.6/10.",
    "3": "Dream Scenario is very sweet and very sad. And ya know what, that's ok. Not every movie is a happy movie. Like most a24 films it will make you feel all the feels. I don't think I've ever seen dreams portrayed so realistically. It also really palpably got that thing where a dream seems so terrifying just to you, then when you tell someone about it out loud it doesn't seem as scary as it was when you were in it. Just beautifully directed by Kristoffer Borgli. Every single time I see a Nicolas Cage film I think no one else could've played this role, & I think that's really special.For fans of Everything Everywhere All At Once, Being John Malkovich, Vanilla Sky.",
    "4": "Dream Scenario is right up my alley. A timid professor who has awkward experiences almost daily gets to steal the limelight when he starts to appear as an impassive spectator in other people's dreams. He enjoys the fame, which seems to flutter his immediate family. And so starts a ride to uncharted territory, speaking a lot about the current state of affairs around us. Cancel culture, 'gram influencers, AI, mind implanting - everything gets a nod in this superbly structured film that I could relate with so much. Nicolas Cage is so good as the central character, almost making me feel that he was enacting me on onscreen. The right amount of awkwardness, perfect look and air, and an honest outlook. This is the best film I watched at the 2023 MAMI Mumbai Film Festival so far.",
    "5": "Horror Comedy? Uhm, yeah, no. Sure, there's a handful of funny moments and some scary stuff but it's far from being a horror comedy. This is a very traditional \"Nicolas Cage\" drama, through and through. It has an air of humor and awkwardness throughout all of it due to his performance, but overall, there's a bigger picture behind it. Oddly enough, in a lot of ways it felt like a very late companion piece to Cage's performance in The Weather Man, a movie where his character also deals with consequences of fame while dealing with a crumbling family life. The biggest difference is that Dream Scenario leans farther into the consequences of fame that celebrities never asked for and that consumers fail to understand because of the media. This is a very sad and upsetting movie that I would say accurately captures that feeling of not having control of your life. It's definitely among the best films I've seen this year.",
    "6": "This is a film that was weird - no problem with that, I enjoyed \"Being John Malovich\" - but this was weird with no point and no resolution. Yes, there was something about cancel culture, but ultimately it was unresolved.A man is dreamt about by al. Why? It is never explained.People get angry as he does mad stuff in the dreams. (Okay, I have dreamt about people but then, waking up, I've not held a grudge)Then, it gets commercialised somehow, and he stops appearing in dreams for ... no reason. His marriage breaks up, the film ends.Why did this happen? Why did it stop? What was the message?What was the POINT?",
    "7": "An A24 film produced by Ari Aster and Nicolas Cage, and starring Cage in the lead: things are going to get weird. Unfortunately, Dream Scenario is a classic case of most of the good bits being in the trailer.Once the film has established its quirky set-up -- college professor Paul Matthews becomes a sensation when he randomly starts to appear in strangers' dreams and is courted by a marketing agency keen to exploit his 'exposure'-- it doesn't really go anywhere interesting, its commentary on the potential pitfalls of fame, in particular the scourge of cancel culture, topical but not exactly profound.Cage is as loopy as always, and undeniably fun to watch, as his character initially enjoys his newfound celebrity, but has to deal with fear and mistrust when his night-time appearances take a darker turn; but his latest off-beat performance in a career littered with such roles can only take us so far, and the plot loses traction in the final act as it introduces a sci-fi element, borne out of Paul Matthews' inexplicable experience: a device that enables anyone to enter another person's dreams.",
    "8": "Nicolas Cage is a phenomenal being and his character experiences getting fame from thousands dreaming about him which turns dark fast. So much of this film is masterful, quite bizarre, refreshing, original, and fairly dark look at how scary fame can be all of it is lovable! Whether you hate or love Nicolas Cage he's been going strong with an impressive backlog of roles the last 40 years he is a pure legend that I admire. I love this take on dreams effecting personal life it is a great thrill ride! Some of it is weird like the girl that has a dream of sex and wants to rein-act the events not sure if that's a spoiler mostly not regardless I'd recommend this gem.",
    "9": "So let me state that it's going to have some vague spoilers, but nothing significant. The first quarter of the movie is a good start. It's more of a horror movie than a comedy, so I don't understand why they're promoting it as a comedy. Don't expect a lot of laughs if you go to see it; it's much darker. There are a couple of things in this movie that go on for far too long: a really uncomfortable and awkward infidelity sequence, and a drawn-out board meeting that doesn't progress. This movie delves into cancel culture and becoming a pariah, and it's pretty sinister at times, not light-hearted at all. Unfortunately, Nicolas Cage's character comes off as kind of wimpy. Nobody respects him; he's socially awkward and somewhat of a people-pleaser, ending up awkward and alone. I did like the premise, though-it was interesting, exploring the stigma of instant fame and losing it due to social awkwardness and cancel culture. I watched this on the second day it opened, and there were only four other people in the theater, which wasn't a good sign. It's more of an experimental culture trip with Nicolas Cage portraying a professionally socially awkward weirdo. I usually like his zany characters, but this was a bit cringy at times. It's not bad; I just think people might expect more laughs, whereas this movie is darker and more sinister than anticipated.",
    "10": "Nicholas Cage is everything, everywhere, all at once. Well, at least in your dreams, he is. Dream Scenario is such a delightful film. It's so good that it's frustrating that it's not even better.What I mean is that Dream Scenario has a concept so inspired and subversive, and a lead in Nicholas Cage that has all the markings of a cinematic icon. The sequences, especially in the dream realm, are as magical as they are frightening. This is filmmaking come completely alive. I couldn't tell what was coming next from scene to scene and I loved that.But with all that said, I think the story closes out in a way that doesn't properly bring things all together. Unlike films like Groundhog Day or Being John Malkovich, it feels as though Dream Scenario struggles to come to a satisfying conclusion of Paul Matthew's bizarre predicament.Paul Matthews never realizes that he has dominion over everyone else's dreams. He doesn't master his otherworldly craft. Instead, his newly found fame consumes him and destroys everything in his life. Meanwhile, The dreams that everyone has of him start as curious, then terrifying, and then they just stop happening all together. We are never given the reason why. Only at the behest of technological software given to him does he go back and tries to fix the life that his dreams ruined, but even then, it's too late. In the end, Paul Matthews is just a hapless victim of a phenomenon that comes and goes. Perhaps that's just how this kind of thing would go in real life. Maybe it would be just as tragic as this film makes it appear.Flaws aside, this is the exact kind of movie that A24 does best. This is a freewheeling ride that doesn't stop being a good time. Kristoffer Borgli is a name I'll be keeping an eye on and you should be too. This is his first big feature in the USA, and it showcases just how fresh and talented of a storyteller he is.",
    "11": "Seen at the 2023 filmfestival in Ghant (Belgium). Very interesting plot, yet it became less interesting as the story proceeded. Luckily, there were some hilarious scenes to compensate the deteriorating concept.I'm wondering about the relatively innocent dreams at the start, one time changed to consensual sex, but later turned all into violent actions by Paul. In the beginning we saw Paul appearing as a passive bystander, who did nothing to intervene in the frightening things that happened to the \"owner\" of the dream. Subsequently, we saw it demonstrated by one of the marketeersters, where he entered her flat (unknown how), moved to a place next to her on the couch, trying to kiss her etc etc, later by her described as good sex, so not necessarily a horrifying event (apart from entering the flat). In ALL later dreams we saw that Paul acted violently, unprovoked by the dreamer, traumatic events for all of them. (There was one dream by Paul himself where he also appeared as the aggressor, an interesting plot-twist but not exploited further.)The marketing firm, initially contacted to promote Paul's not-yet-existing book, started on the wrong foot, turning the meeting into a confusion for all, mostly due to coming from completely different worlds. What added to the mix-up is that the marketeers had a product in their mind while Paul constantly insisted that the meeting was about his book. In the final scenes, much later, we see that a bracelet gadget was actually developed. It started a dream onto someone else in the world, yet without the option to choose who. It was a result out of research after that what happened with Paul was better understood by science, used to build a working tool. Another sub-plot not fully exploited, a pity, it could open new avenues and food for thought.",
    "12": "I found out about this film on Rotten Tomatoes, it sounded like a smart concept, and then I saw a photo of the leading star and the clever reference to A Nightmare on Elm Street, with him wearing Freddy Krueger's glove, so I was hoping for something enjoyable. Basically, Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage) is an ordinary evolutionary biology professor and family man planning to publish his book, but he hasn't even started it. One day, he is seemingly recognised by hostess Avery (Liz Adjei) at a restaurant before meeting colleague Sheila Harper (Paula Boudreau) who may have connections with publishers. Then, after going to the theatre with his wife Janet (Julianne Nicholson), he is approached by his journalist ex-girlfriend Claire (Marnie McPhail Diamond) who says that she dreamed about him. After agreeing to meet her for lunch, Claire tells Paul that she works for the New Enquiry, an online magazine blog, and wants to write about him appearing in dreams. He soon notices many other people recognising him and mentioning having these occurrences. His Facebook profile is linked to the published article, and he soon realises that he has been appearing in the dreams of people all over the world. Among the various messages, he receives an invitation from Mass 24 News for an interview, and he ignores Janet's concerns before doing anything drastic. Paul is interviewed and he quickly becomes an unofficial celebrity; he revels in the attention it brings and thinks it might lead to offers to publish his book, which he still hasn't written. At his college, all his students have turned up for class, and he asks them to describe their dreams and what he does in them; he is frustrated by his depiction as passive and uninteresting. One day, a mentally ill person sees Paul in his dreams, he breaks into his house and tries to kill him, prompting Janet to remind him of the consequences of fame. College dean Brett (Tim Meadows) also talks about his concerns that Paul is exploiting his newfound fame and thinks he should be careful. But Paul ignores this and goes to meet staff at unconventional viral marketing firm Thoughts? The slightly sleazy head Trent (Michael Cera) has wild ideas that they could use Paul to plant product placement into people's dreams, and mentions being in contact with Sprite. Paul is further frustrated that they have more interest in using Paul to advertise than trying to help him publish his book, which he has not written a word of. The firm's assistant Molly (Dylan Gelula) admits to Paul that she has had erotic dreams about him. She asks him to come to her apartment to re-enact one of her dreams despite Paul being married, but he prematurely ejaculates and leaves humiliated. Paul is angered when he learns that Sheila Harper has published an article on the subject of \"antelligence theory\", the subject he intended to write about in his book. Soon, Paul finds fewer students attending his class after his presence in their dreams has become actively violent and hateful. Attitudes towards Paul and Janet change, they have their careers damaged because of the fear sweeping the nation. Janet feels uncomfortable with the negative attention surrounding them, and the relationship with his daughters Sophie (Lily Bird) and Hannah (Jessica Clement) becomes strained. Paul and Janet are invited to dinner by friend Richard (Dylan Baker) who is known for holding prestigious parties, but the company is not present, and Richard's wife Carlota (Krista Bridges) feels uncomfortable with Paul after having a nightmare. Paul becomes more confrontational as people, having had nightmares, approach him nervously, negatively or harass him; he redirects his anger at Janet after getting into a brawl. The school attempts to reassure the students that they are in no danger by holding a cognitive behavioural therapy session in the gymnasium with therapist Candice (Cara Volchoff). They have gradual exposure to Paul, he slowly approaches them from a safe distance until someone feels uncomfortable or threatened, but they start leaving the moment he speaks. Paul is angered when he finds his car spray-painted and he is given leave. Paul's daughters become aware of the negativity surrounding the dreams and he ineffectively tries to reason with them that he has no control of what the dreams entail. Later, Paul has a dream of himself being shot by arrows, and the killer is himself. After having this dream, Paul follows Janet's advice to go online and make an apology video about the phenomenon, but it is considered self-pitying. Janet is humiliated and forces him to move out. That night, Paul tries to enter the school to see his younger daughter's school play, despite teacher Kayla (Jennifer Wigmore) warning him that the parents do not want him there. Kayla tries to stop him entering the school hall, forcing his way through, and accidentally injuring the teacher in the process. Everyone is shocked and wrongfully assumes this to be a violent attack and he is thrown out. Sometime later, the dreams of Paul have stopped, and dream-travelling technology has been invented, allowing people to enter the dreams of other people, primarily to be used for advertising. Janet has separated from Paul and is dating her co-worker. Paul has finally written a book, his autobiography titled Dream Scenario, and goes on a mediocre tour in France to sell it. But he struggles to gain interest, and it has been retitled I Am Your Nightmare without his consent. Paul later uses the dream-travel tech to enter one of Janet's dreams. In the dream, he saves her life while wearing an old Halloween costume, something she said was her ideal dream of him. Paul wishes the dream to be real before floating away as Janet wakes up. Also starring Kate Berlant as Mary, David Klein as Andy, Noah Lamanna as Jessie, Nicholas Braun as Brian Berg, Amber Midthunder as Haley, Al Warren as Chris, Maev Beaty as Naomi, Kaleb Horn as Miles, Ben Caldwell as Eli, Agape Mngomezulu as Robbie, and Sofia Banzhaf as Leah. Cage being bald with a beard and glasses is unusual for the character types we are used to him playing but he is interesting being a hapless man desperate for recognition, obviously it doesn't go the way he intends. It is a quaint film that uses the idea of dreaming to full advantage in some abstract sequences, and it satirises the positive and negative effects of celebrity and fame. It is unfortunate that the last few scenes, with the ridiculous wristbands to transport people into dreams, make the ending fall flat and there is no real resolution, but I did find enough of it funny to just about forgive, it is a reasonable black comedy fantasy. Worth watching!",
    "13": "This film was thoroughly unentertaining. It started well and the concept showed potential but it was executed poorly. As always Nicolas Cage did his best with what he had to work with, but sadly that wasn't much at all. It certainly isn't much of a comedy, I laughed a couple of times.The most infuriating thing in this film is the protagonist seemingly never losing his love for his wife who is vile for the entire film. A decent ending would see him happy the whole thing happened just so he could see her for who she really was and be rid of her.Having been disappointed by both this and A24's Past Lives recently I think it's fair to say A24 are losing their touch a bit and living on former glories.",
    "14": "Brilliant great film brilliant. The acting is amazing, truly incredible and incentivising like nothing ever seen before this year in global cinema. I have no criticisms of the film since I've seen the film in a pre-cinema release; cage is back on top form, best movie in years, I won't give everything away but it's a must see this winter. I understand it's currently awaiting release momentarily and may not be readily and accessibly available for every person out there in all global regions, but once it is, I highly recommend and suggest you watch the film! It's totally worth it and i certainly do not regret watching it!",
    "15": "Uncomfortable, beautiful movie that's equally funny as it was unsettling. Nicks performance is subtle yet very in depth about a man lacking in huberous and he dives into feeling more and more like he's not getting what he feels he deserves, coming at the cost of his family, reputation, and career.Incredibly well shot, how nick cage is framed is always at a screwed angle. He walks with slow uncertain demeanor, and the worst part, I find the qualities he carries, too familiar to many men I know. The main character oozes the feeling of a man so convinced he's done nothing wrong and causes the harm of thousands of people.An interesting look at influencers and celebrity culture. Nicks character is \"cancelled\" in a way that is very realistic, and shows the effect it has on the person and people close to him, as well as the dangers of fame.",
    "16": "First of all I am not a fan of horror movies but to consider this a horror comedy is kind of an oxymoron to me. I saw the trailer and I thought it wasn't for me but we went. And I must say the movie made no sense and it was eerie. But there are no decent well-written movies out there. Which is sad. Nicholas Cage has done much better work and there's been much better movies out there Gone in 60 seconds, The Rock, next,.. I noticed that he produced this movie I feel like he needed to produce because he wanted to be in a film but there's no good scripts out there and they seem to forget about the good actors that are really out there. Now I don't think Nicholas Cage is the best actor but I do think he is a good actor in the movies I've seen him in. It's just a shame that I felt like this was a waste of time there was no point to it which usually to horror movies there are no point. I just wasn't prepared for pointless movie. I do see that has gotten reviews probably from people who like horror movies but I don't. So I gave it a one only because I could make no sense of it. And it didn't leave you feeling good at all. His other movies I always felt good at the end. Sorry Nick but I think you could have chosen a better written movie if there's one out there. Maybe back some riders that can actually write a decent movie for people to see when you compare it to the older stuff there's just no comparison but I'm a Casablanca fan.",
    "17": "This movie had no compelling characters. No compelling relationships. No explanation of the main theme of the movie. Nothing that remotely approached resolution. Dark comedy? I'll allow the dark part of that, though only minimally. The comedy never showed up. Oh the movie needed it, boy did it, but the only laughter heard was by the theater manager as I shelled out my $$ for seats. I should've been clued in as the 2 of us had the entire theater to ourselves on a Saturday night. Worst movie I've seen in theater - Cage and all involved should be embarrassed. No clue what some of these other reviewers were watching but this movie is trash.",
    "18": "It has been said already that this film has similar notes/vibes to Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind, Being John Malkovich, The Truman Show, etc. I would agree. It kind of traps the viewer into the increasingly sinister and truly nightmarish story, which I am far too familiar with!Unfortunately, I dream extremely vividly, and 85/90% of my dreams are extremely traumatic, and/or stressful, exhausting and emotional. So what played out in this film really seemed to echo my own 'nightmare scenario '. It definitely is emotive, thought provoking and relatable. As well as more of a horror than many more 'in your face'/ traditional horrors.It taps into many of the deep fears most humans have....being rejected, despised for no reason. Being misunderstood , and losing what you value most. For me, these are far more terrifying than a bogeyman! It does away with those 'monster ' metaphors I guess?Anyway, in terms of watchability- this definitely held my attention throughout, and all the performances are faultless as far as my naive eye could see. There is some real wit threaded throughout which adds lighter notes and makes to balance the darker elements. So many films are formulaic , or perfectly watchable but, admittedly, forgettable and merge.Dream scenario, though, will certainly stay with me and is a film I keep thinking about and is great to discuss with others. Ethics. The lines between reality and imagination, questions about what constitutes 'trauma', and makes it valid. Plus, a look at the way people are picked up and then taken down in the most dramatic and brutal ways by media and the ever commentating public. I have enjoyed other films more, but it is very worth watching, and what film is partly all about.",
    "19": "Well written, edited, directed, and acted movie. Nicholas Cage is incredible as is everyone else. The movie has a lot of dream sequences but weirdly the movie as a whole, even without the dream sequences, feels like a fever dream.It's very funny at times, uncomfortable at times, and kind of scary at others. About halfway through I thought to myself, \"I have no idea where this is going.\" I then tried to predict what would happen but it's impossible. It takes weird turns and you're along for the ride. If you're looking for something safe and comfortable, this isn't the movie to watch.I saw it two days ago and I can't stop thinking about it. It's a great depiction of fame, and what can happen to someone who becomes famous with no substance behind their fame.",
    "20": "So my wife suggested we go and see this 'comedy'. I have always enjoyed Nic Cage films however this is a clear exception to the rule. It has an interesting start and an interesting premise. The acting is actually very good and if you're one of those who likes to analyse the production cinematography or whatever then it may well be good. I'm a simple chap who absorbs the feel of a film. This film has no humour, no comedy, not a single chuckle or smile observed by me in the audience or on people leaving. It's not a film you walk out of feeling as though you've enjoyed it. There is no 'glimmer', no uplift and no comedy. It leaves you looking for a pub and a decent pint and looking for somewhere to cheer yourself up because it really is dire. I'm sure film experts will find value in it however for me it was just draining and left me feeling utterly flat. The trailer was also misleading, this is no comedy. Enjoy!",
    "21": "I saw Dream Sequences, starring Nicolas Cage-Renfield, Fast Times at Ridgemont High; Julianne Nicholson-Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, August: Osage County and Tim Meadows-The Goldbergs_tv, Hubie Halloween.This is an interesting look at the consequences of being a celebrity. Nicolas plays a college professor that leads a pretty boring life with Julianne, his wife. Things change when people start having dreams with Nicolas in them. It starts with just a few people but then it gets bigger, with people that don't even know him. In the dreams, something will be happening and Nicolas just shows up, but he doesn't do anything. He doesn't have any kind of interaction with the dreamer. Nicolas becomes popular-enjoying the fame he never had-but then the dreams change, with some people even having sexual dreams with him participating and others are being attacked by Nicolas. People soon turn against Nicolas, with some fearing him and others not wanting him around or even teaching anymore. Tim plays Nicolas' boss at the college that doesn't know how to handle the situation; should he back Nicolas up, since he didn't really do anything wrong or should he listen to the people and fire Nicolas? Like I said, it is interesting.It's rated R for language, violence and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 42 minutes.I am a big Nicolas Cage fan and I liked it enough to buy it on DVD.",
    "22": "This movie drags on for 1 hour 45 minutes and literally goes nowhere, i mean nowhere for the viewer at all. It just goes on and on about guy being paranoid and whining about the fact he appears in various peoples dream and it kind of disturbs him. Its weird and strange but underwhelming in many aspects as it never really finds exciting way to explore or deliver the story idea. The movie doesn't stand out much at all and there isn't anything strikingly worthy and talking point in the entire longevity of the film. It's sad to see nicholas cage staring in elderly role as it doesn't do him any favours, this movie is not classic at all, it's dreaded and boring movie that you can't wait to forget and you will with no trouble at all.",
    "23": "Is Nicolas Cage a better actor now than he ever was in the past? Considering he's a 2-time Oscar nominee and winner for his role in \"Leaving Las Vegas\" perhaps not, but the argument can be made that he seems to be having more fun now than ever before. Dream Scenario is refreshingly ambitious in highlighting the validating nature of recognition contrasted by the horrific evolution of cancel culture. Whether he's committed to the role or simply a perfect fit, this performance by Nicolas Cage is incredibly hilarious and equally tragic making his character \"the most interesting person in the world\" as mentioned in the film. A24 tends to find filmmakers who tell a deeper story than what's being shown at the surface. Kristoffer Borgli jam packs a lot to consider in this reflective character study, but the one area that he explores the least, as seen in the conclusion, seems to be the missing link in what could have made this film an abstract masterpiece. Produced by Ari Aster, \"Dream Scenario\" is quirky, hilarious, scary, and a film that'll leave you and your friends exploring its themes and ideas long after the credits have rolled.",
    "24": "Don't get me wrong I like some of cage's movies but when I watched this I see this as something that tried to give a example of cancel culture. Now the story of someone in different people's dreams sounds like a good movie, kinda forgettable but interesting. The beginning seemed rushed & sometimes cage says things like it's the first take. I cringed when I heard most of the jokes & I didn't know that the ending happened because I thought the ending was somewhere in the resolution. For a movie where they rushed most of the beginning it felt so slow & failing to keep up with the times. It's gonna be such a forgettable movie & would definitely not recommend.",
    "25": "So I picked this movie after looking at reviews. My husband was looking at his watch a third of the way through saying do we really have to stay for this. This movie was one of the worst movies we seen in a long long time both of us were waiting for it to be over. It was not only boring, but it had the most boring. But the peoples personality in the movie was also very boring and very unrealistic considering the young girl in the movie and the attractiveness of the teacher. Would never happen. I have to make this review longer to use it however, there's not much more to say about this movie other than I would not recommend anybody going to see it.",
    "26": "If you've seen the trailer, you know that Dream Scenario has a fantastic high concept.Other than that, after executing its premise it becomes a dour depressing mess that builds to nothing. Professional reviewers seem to strain to account for this by attributing some deeper meaning but there isn't one. It's a terrible movie that has some brilliant moments - especially the infamous \"sex scene\" - but if you pay to see this you'll want your money back.I felt so uncomfortable that I would have walked out if it didn't mean disturbing people in my theater's row. A lot of care went into the acting but I suspect this film fell victim to someone telling the director that he is brilliant a few too many times,",
    "27": "This is the story of a very average and forgettable man who enters into people's dreams without meaning to. With a premise like that, as an audience member you know what you're about to experience is either science fiction or surreal existentialism. Borgli takes the second route, with some overall positive results. The story satirizes celebrity culture, and that's something you really start to notice. The director clearly pays attention to some aspects of society and culture, and it's undeniable that it pays off. As an allegory, seeing a celebrity as just a random guy that exists in your unconscious without your consent is brilliant. It reminds me of the line in \"Paprika\", where she says that internet and dreams are kind of the same. Movies, social media, celebrity tabloids, they all create alternative realities to our own. And celebrities are like the Nic-Cage-in-a-Bald-Cap wondering randomly in our thoughts, doing nothing, not intervening (because of course we don't know them, we don't matter to them). It's a very successful allegory that will stick with me for some time. Stuff like parasocial relationships, cancel culture are also explored. It's a fascinating allegory. But. BUT...\nThe movie is too much allegory, to the point where 3/4 of the way through I just stopped caring about the character and I just started to try guessing where the plot is gonna go based on the real life equivalent of the story. A movie should not be a clear code for something else. This is when the satire becomes excess. You wanna transport this idea into the real world and give it a grounded spin, but you also don't even try and makes the fantasy aspect internally logic - not that you have to, but if your story brings a fantasy element into the real world we expect to understand that element better. How did the evil CEO of that weirdly out-of-place ad down the end master this technology? What did Matthews do that allowed it to happen for him? You're not meant to ask this, you're just meant to think \"yeah bro that's so true. Capitalism sells things. Really makes you think about society\". And that's kind of annoying, it felt like the movie just gave up subtlety entirely. Why even is there a second tech CEO parody other than Michael Cera? You could have made the existence of the product a bit more subtle, a little more in the background, instead of just stopping the movie to play a piece of *satire*. My honest frustration is that there was a simple remedy to this: make the product exist and make it be the cause of the whole thing (like Cage accidentally activated it or something, and that was the moment where the CEO discovered you can influence people's dreams). I know that the lack of agency of the character is the point, but you get this frustrating feeling that you are not watching a story, you're being subjected to an allegory that moves according to the rules of the socially conscious director. It's an issue I have with recent Scandinavian satire. Sick of Myself works better because it's simpler and actually real in every aspect. Here you have a fantasy element that clearly exists to deliver a theme and doesn't answer to any rules. Which makes this movie... kind of preachy in the end. Sadly.Also, another small issue I have is with Nic Cage. He is not really believable as a nobody. He is too charismatic and too commanding. He tries so hard in this role, and he partially succeeds. But also sometimes he behaves like those exaggerated caricatures of the \"losers\" in high school that movies sometimes do, when they give them these cartoonishly ugly looks and they are so socially inept it gets straight up unrealistic.So yeah, those are the flaws. Other than that, the movie is very well directed. Good atmosphere, good dark/fun balance (like Sick of Myself), good acting from the rest of the cast, realistic dialogue. If you like satirical movies about society and wanna have a good time watching something weird and undeniably iconic then you should watch this.",
    "28": "Dream Scenario is a nightmare scenario. I LOVE Nick Cage BUT this is bad, very bad. Poor dialog, standard scene shots, BAD acting all around, bad directing. Awful story telling, underestimates the audience intellect. There must have been a big payday for Nick to do this one. The usual side characters that talk like no one in real life. The dialog is routine and dull, the setups are boring and typical and the storytelling is a long slow disaster. It doesnt even seem like Nick is trying too hard with this character. Pathetic boring trash from the indie market that will leave you saying \"Huh?????\"",
    "29": "This was a highly ambitious idea that became over complicated and tried to be a dark comedy horror picture. I neither laughed nor got scared. In fact I was disappointed and annoyed throughout the whole thing. I guess this film is a satire of our political landscape and how controversial figures get cancelled and have their lives under a microscope.It started off fast paced and auspicious, but eventually there was no linearity with the events. A Black Mirror episode probably could have been achieved with this concept.I tried to keep an open mind here but over the years I could never understand the appeal for Nic Cage. He always has that snarl and grin about him that's unappealing and acts angry and awkward during what should be emotional scenes.",
    "30": "Critics keep referring to this as a hilarious comedy. It is not!! If this is a comedy some people must have very strange senses of humour. It is dark, horrific and bleak and reflects cancel culture society. There is a great cast with terrific performances that are woefully let down by a weak script that loses its way by the second act. I got free tickets to see it and even that could not console me that I had wasted 2 hours watching it. None of the characters are particularly nice or even likeable and most are selfish and self-centred with limited empathy for our protagonist's struggles. One watch movie!!",
    "31": "I applaud original film story ideas, I really do, but this missed the mark. As mentioned in another review, an explanation for the lead's predicament was not extant in the story which leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. You can't just conjure up \"something crazy\" have it play out but then never explain what caused it.Sure, the results of \"something crazy\" can be amusing but so what? We still need a proper resolution which this film does not have. Instead we are left with essentially a hackneyed and very traditional movie ending where the lead gets the girl and walks off into the sunset.A commentary on fame? I guess. But again, the point of departure for the whole story is a fluke. It's like having a unloved man suddenly beloved by all because he suddenly can poop gold bars. Would an audience care more about the subsequent response to such a miracle and completely forget what caused the response? I don't know. I wouldn't.",
    "32": "I gotta be frank... I didn't like Dream Scenario. While there is an originality to this concept that was intriguing throughout, I felt it never felt fully explored. Mixing anxiety-ridden horror with dark comedy to comment on cancel culture was interesting, but I don't think the movie ever really worked for me. Nicolas Cage was amusingly awkward.Worked better for me when I thought of it as a sort of Freddy Krueger origin story... but really, while I was impressed with its originality and I know a lot of people are liking it... it just wasn't for me.It all made sense when I saw \"produced by Ari Aster\"...",

The film's originality shines through its captivating plot, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats. With a perfect balance of drama, suspense, and a touch of humor, it proves to be a delightful experience for movie enthusiasts. The seamless blend of captivating storytelling and Nicholas Cage's stellar performance makes Dream Scenario a must-watch, setting a new standard for excellence in filmmaking. Cage's portrayal adds depth and authenticity to the characters, elevating the movie to a whole new level.

    "35": "In 35 years of seeing movies in the cinema this is the first time I have ever walked out. What a truly crap film. There is no other way to describe it. I have seen brilliant Nicholas Cage comedies, dramas, thrillers and action films but this is the worst tripe he's ever been in. I can't believe that I was taken in my the critics reviews. When you read the reviews, it's absolute twaddle - thinking it's a psychological masterpiece that has its pulse on the zeitgeist and an allegory for todays obsession with fame... Critics trying to sound smart. If you want to literally waste 100 minutes of your time and who knows how much money - go for it. For anyone else DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY.",
    "36": "That's how I felt at the end of the movie, the first 2/3 of the movie was great, and then not so much. It seemed like they ran out of script and were like \"what do we do now, this isn't long enough\" then started putting in strange, well stranger, content with an ending that was very disappointing. Nicolas Cage was brilliant, an entirely different type of character for him and he was amazing. There was nothing wrong with the performances at all, just the very odd last third of the movie. The storyline was different from anything I've seen before and overall I did enjoy it, just not the last 20 minutes of so.",
    "37": "If you like Cage, you may like this. Not being his fan, I have to consider the larger context of the movie. This is a tragedy, in which the professor's life goes from bad to worse. That's partly his own doing, as he lacks the emotional intelligence to turn his course around. In the end, the story doesn't reach a conclusion and has no message or moral. Lots of entertaining scenes and the supporting actors are quite good. Cage does very well with this difficult part and pulls it off with skill and credibility. On his strength, I rate the film a 6. Otherwise, it deserves a lower rating due to an incomplete plot. An example of good acting with insufficient writing and producing.",
    "38": "I was told that this movie is a comedy. Critics said that it was hilarious and that it gave them many roaring belly laughs throughout the film. I was in the mood for a comedy, so I decided to take their advice and see this film. I was ready too, after all I love me some Nic Cage.The film starts out interestingly enough. I was interested in the characters and the premise and was eager to see where it was all going to go, but as the movie went on, I started to realize that nothing funny was happening and the questions started to leap out into my thoughts. \"This is a comedy\", I thought? NO, as the movie progressed, I learned that indeed, this is NOT a comedy. I don't know what this movie is, but I know it's not funny. In fact, it's kind of horrifying. Nic's character essentially does nothing wrong, and he has his entire life fall apart and is treated horribly by everyone because of some dreams they had, and the ending is just plain depressing. I felt lied to and cheated by dishonest critics after seeing this movie, so it gets a 1/10. If I hadn't been lied to and went in knowing what this movie actually is, it might have gotten a better score. After all, the actors did a great job. It's shot really well, and it did keep me engaged, but why the dishonesty? Why lie to get people in the seats? It doesn't make any sense to me.",
    "39": "That's it. I doubt it would have made it to theaters without him. So it was interesting to watch, but was not that good of a movie really. There was no ending, no explanation to what happened, and not that much action. In fact, the interaction with other characters was really bad. See it or don't. He is good, sort of a student film. Decent production shots. Otherwise kind of dumb. There could have been many dream sequences that could have been developed more instead of subliminal frame inserts and 2 second dream scenes. So it didn't make lots of sense. I would say it is about a college professor trying to keep his job and have a career as these bad things happen around him because of how he starts to get judged by people. It becomes just about how one deals with society and societies mental problems. Leading a pretty sad life, but he has some family that love him. I suppose it is a reflection of the writers real life struggles and disillusions about life in general.",
    "40": "After watching Beau is Afraid and now this, I can say that Ari Aster has a really good grasp on Jungian psychology. This film was obvious to me. It reminded me of my dad. It's criticism of a mode of being that many people have myself included- due to trauma- avoiding ones primal desires and having them manifest in ones dreams. It combined with this idea the idea of the \"culture war\" and how the collective unconscious manifests through culture. It was a good documentation of reality how it is now. A psychological documentation of the present. That makes it a good movie. I think it will age well.",
    "41": "The narrative revolves around the character played by Nicolas Cage, who becomes an overnight celebrity due to his inexplicable appearances in strangers' dreams. This bizarre twist leads to various societal and cultural reactions. Eventually the dreams become more violent despite the character not being involved in appearing in people's heads in any ways. \"Dream Scenario,\" a satirical take on cancel culture, cleverly illustrates the absurdity of public judgment dictating personal fates. Nicolas Cage's portrayal of a professor thrust into notoriety by strangers' dreams captures the chaos of societal perception over personal agency, offering a witty, poignant critique of modern culture's readiness to 'cancel.'",
    "42": "It is Adaptation, but not good. The difference is Nick Cage's character isn't just pathetic, he iis unlikeable like the rest of the characters.We are supposed to have some sympathy for him, but he is awful. There may have been one comedic moment. If that. The wife is terrible.The reason that Adaptation was so awesome was you could sympathize with the character. In this film he is just a jerk and you only want him to failI try to support independent cinema in the age of crappy reboots and superhero films. But just because it is A24 doesn't mean it doesn't suck. How this is a 7.4 eludes me.",
    "43": "Enjoyed this immensely. Cinematography superb, exceptional cast throughout. An absolute pleasure of a screenplay to watch be established to a whole. As for the story, it's up for interpretation but here's how I saw it and I ended up in an ugly cry (influenced by feelings I had been having that made the main character relatable) in the theater.A man feels lost. He feels like he's ineffectual. Then he's recognized and heralded, yet for his ineffectual nature. Things change. He loses sight of what he has in his pursuit of recognition and ability to affect others. He does, but not for the best. This manifests in a terrible way. Others exploit the phenomenon. He understands too late where he was truly ineffectual, possibly too late.Don't let your pursuit of ego let you lose sight of what really makes your life tolerable.",
    "44": "Could have been more. An interesting premise of a bland middle aged professor (Paul Matthews) showing up in the dreams of complete strangers along with some family. In the beginning no explanation is seriously offered up for this phenomenon, but like another concept movie, Groundhog Day, you jut buy into the idea and go along for the ride. And it works...for awhile.The cast is good. Nicolas Cage has such a signature acting style that I always find enjoyable to watch. Dream sequences are seamless and entertaining. And the movie explores the unintended consequences of his fame that eventually degrades his mental state and likely the strangers dreams of him now becoming nightmares.The wheels fall off near the end where the movie inserts a (fake) commercial about a company that has harnessed Paul's dream ability. It simply broke my suspension of disbelief. From then on I couldn't get back into the movie.Giving it a 6/10. Some thought provoking material that falls short in it's execution.",
    "45": "I didn't enjoy it very much. I admit that Nicolas Cage is a great actor and gives everything to his roles but the story just wasn't enjoyable for me. I mean I laughed at few moments here and there but overall it felt annoying for no one to be on his side. I suppose some will say it's about cancel culture others will say it's more than that. Perhaps it's about the ups and downs of sudden fame. If you enjoyed it then great but it felt like an episode of The Twilight Zone to me. I'm not sorry I went to see it though because we do need more unusual films that step outside of what is considered normal cinema.",
    "46": "I will watch just about anything with Nicolas Cage and the plot is intriguing before first watch. But one thing that threw me off from loving it more than I do is how it's a metaphor for cancel culture. Paul Matthew, a college professor, is a near nobody who rises into fame once everyone has reoccurring dreams with him as a passive bystander. With the rise in fame everyone to meets him and a partnership with an entertainment agency. But once the dreams start to change for the worse with Paul torturing and doing vile things to the dreamers, people get uncomfortable around Paul which changes his life for the worse. No one wants him around, people ask him to leave restaurants and to not to come to his daughter play recital. His life never returns back to normal and once the dreams start to go away, he goes to the wayside and people quit caring about him except for the few who bought his novel. Like most celebrities that get cancelled, they have a meteoric rise before the harsh fall, and then fall to the wayside into obscurity where very few people, if any, care.",
    "47": "I loved the concept, loved the statements on fame and the absurdity of cancel culture, loved Nick Cage's total aloofness to it all. But i absolutely despised the ending, the sudden intro of a comical dream product that was named into the plot suddenly and without explanation, the complete lack of resolution or closure, and the stupidity / lack of thought, understanding or reality from the family. I get it's an exaggerated statement on the masses judging someone regardless of what they actually did, but some sort of circumstantial explanation or finale would have been welcome.It's like the cast was suspending disbelief and waiting for an ending as much as I was and it never came to anyone.Never developed as a horror film, wasn't funny enough to be a comedy. I was enjoying it so much as a \"what the hell is about to happen\" experience except...nothing happened.",
    "48": "Dream Scenario is a really funny look at unexpected fame and how it's impossible to control how others interpret it. A be careful what you wish for story that's a lot stronger when primarily focusing on how fame changes a person than when it delves into cancel culture.Uncomfortable with how his own image has been interpreted, Nicolas Cage is the ideal person for this. He plays the pitiful nature of Paul beautifully and brings none of the Cage rage he's synonymous with, in a nice change of pace. The film also feels aware of Cage's persona, understanding everything is funnier and weirder because it's Nic Cage specifically.Kristoffer Borgli's direction really nails the dream sequences in particular. They're very surreal (obviously), brief and when they start to turn into nightmares they really don't hold back on the violence. It also has the second most hilariously awkward sex scene of recent memory, with Beau Is Afraid being number one which is so fitting since Ari Aster is a producer on this.",
    "49": "Dream Scenario. The increasingly brilliant Nicholas Cage continues his renaissance following his recent superb performances in Mandy, Pig and The unbearable weight of massive talent. Cage plays a run of the mill university professor who oozes normality. His students take no real notice of him. His former colleagues publish papers in top journals whilst he hasn't even started his book yet. But he's happy enough, if not fulfilled. Then, for no apparent reason, he starts appearing in people's dreams. Not just people who know or have met him. Anyone. And in the dreams they tend to be in difficult positions but he does absolutely nothing. He has no control over this. The first half of the film is hilarious - the whole cinema (the lovely Electric, Birmingham) we're in stitches as we see the dreams played out. And then the second half of the film takes a sinister turn, to reflect a changing nature of the dreams. And whilst the comedy ends at this point, the drama begins. Whilst the first half is the better half it would be wrong to say the second is disappointing. Cage is quickly becoming one of my favourite actors. Long may it continue. 8 out of ten.",
    "50": "The first eighty percent of this film was excellent - it felt like the best Stephen King story that King didn't write. The slow destruction of the life of an ordinary man for reasons which were completely outside his control was well-conceived, well-plotted and well acted. Nicholas Cage's performance was pitch perfect.To an extent, this film can be seen as a satirical condemnation of social media fame and cancel culture, though that's secondary to the theme of mounting paranoia - both from Prof Matthews and the wider world.The fact that this film started out as a project of Ari Aster is no surprise, as it has much in common with Beau is Afraid - notably the hapless and powerless central character and some surreal and blackly comic moments.Then, in the last fifteen minutes or so, the film loses its way. A new element is brought in which pretty much undermines what had gone before. The result wasn't bad, exactly, but seemed to belong in a different film. I think it would've been better if the film had had the courage of its convictions and followed Prof Matthews to his logical fate.For all that, it's an interesting film, and I would urge you to see it.",
    "51": "Giving this an 7/10 ratingOddball film, another for Nicolas Cage, who produces this one too, plays a college professor, who for some strange reason pops up in peoples dreams, and not in a helpful way either.What starts off as weird, soon becomes disturbing and the moves into the good and evil of social media, corporations, the need too be recognised, self worth, mental health, technology and the abuse of trust and power. This all happens in this movie, with Cage as the driving force.Cage totally look unrecognisable as the professor, bald head, gruff beard, funny walk, he really goes for it. And has too. Everyone else is collateral damage and the enemy. It's a cleaver film on what is going on in the world and media right now, spun into this strange world, which I would not want to a part off, but we are, like it or not.Mixed bag on this one, it's good, but will divide everyone, and people will see things differently, which is the point.",
    "52": "I must say first that Dream Scenario is not at all what I expected it to be. After falling in love with writer/director Kristoffer Borgli's previous film Sick Of Myself, then exploring all of his recent short films on YouTube, I thought I had a grasp on what to expect from Dream Scenario, but I was off and that makes it a bit more challenging to form a solid opinion on. One thing is for certain though: regardless of how much you feel like you are enjoying the film as you are watching it, this is the kind of movie that will have you thinking and talking about it, trying to find all the analogies, for some time afterwards. Though my girlfriend left the theater a total of 4 times due to anxiety, she pulled even more apt metaphor out of it than I did when it was over - it gave us a lot to discuss, far more than the average movie.The overall tone was way different than I was expecting. The trailer had me thinking this would be a quirky adventure into dreams and personalities, but Dream Scenario is FAR more horror-leaning than I'd imagined. Having seen Borgli's previous work in combination with the choice to have Nicolas Cage as the lead, this really threw me off. Once you get into it, it often feels like the work of Ari Aster, which made a lot more sense to me when the ending credits hit and I saw that Ari Aster had produced it. Apparently Aster was originally set to direct this film with Adam Sandler as the lead, but after Sick Of Myself did well, Aster pushed to get Borgli in the director's chair for A24. Overall, the movie has its signature Borgli moments but it definitely feels like a combination of Borgli, Aster, and A24 vibes rather than simply a Borgli piece.There is not nearly as much comedy as I thought there would be, and most of it is very subdued. I felt like I was laughing more than anyone else in the theater, and it was not much, to be honest. Laughs are simply not one of the primary focuses of the film, in my opinion. And on the subject of atypical focuses, there are hardly fleshed-out characters in this movie at all - they are more like archetypes or vessels that allow the themes to be explored. The way Cage's character works is that he is an effective \"every man\" in the sense that he's not really likable, but also not especially unlikable - he could be just about any average person, and that's the point. The real \"main character\" is society and their response to what's happening in a collective manner.While it's not the most riveting or throughly enjoyable film, it is incredibly original and does seem to have a lot to say underneath it's surface of \"simplicity\". I was expecting something in the realm of Charlie Kaufman, but what I got was perhaps something I can't compare to almost anything else. At one point in the film, there is a book that is released, and when it does the character who wrote it exclaims \"It was supposed to be called Dream Scenario\", then the publisher responds, \"Is there something wrong with the new title, I Am Your Nightmare?\". I feel like this is a fitting summary of my entire experience with this film. I'm not sure if that was all set up on purpose, as a \"haha\" at the viewer's expense, but knowing Borgli and his specific style of genius-level trolling, I'd say he knew exactly what he was doing.",
    "53": "Paul Matthews (Nic Cage) is a schlub professor who everyone overlooks. He has two daughters who function as accessories that describe his such mundane world. His wife Janet (Julianne Nicholson) loves him and appreciates him, but sometimes appears to be an enabler to his own neurosis. When one day people start to tell him that he appears in their dream. Complete strangers.This conceit is a remarkable absurd moment that rockets him into a roller coaster of fame, acceptance and eventual downfall.If you were to put this in context of society, you could say the social media influencers who go viral and inevitably create haters. These are the most dangerous people.At times, it's frustrating to deal with Paul. Since he constantly pitches a book he never intends to write. To a lot of \"creators\" this is painful to watch. A person so devoid of ambition he requires others to antagonize him into action. He relies on victimhood in a sense. And hasn't concluded how unfair life is.This miraculous event shoots him into a world he is unfamiliar with. Where people now \"see\" him. Which he believes will give him the validation he craves. But it backfires when he doesn't do all the right things (the things we would do with this level of fame).The failure of this film is that it does require him to constantly be a punching bag. While a person with common sense would bend to the masses for a specific reason, Paul tends to do the opposite because the plot wants it to happen. This needs to happen for the story to spiral on him. There is no reason for his stubborn behavior. But this could just be a behavioral thing we are suppose to see as a character flaw. To the viewer, it could be REALLY frustrating.The tone of the film is very much like \"Eternal Sunshine Of A Spotless Mind\" Not necessarily the story, but the tone. It is quirky and sometimes laugh out loud funny. Thought I'd never say that. His adventures are silly but fascinating. A smarter socially wiser man would slingshot the fame into something more. Many people who struggle in life would take the Sprite endorsement.In the end, it happens regardless of his efforts. Or lack of.The last part of the movie is a bit rushed. It has very little to do with him and more to do with us as a society. We take a bizarre event and monetize it. We fall for the stupidity of technology. And so forth. It taps into the delusion of getting rich through attention seeking. That part falls a little short. In a longer film, perhaps this would be integrated smoother.This is, in my opinion, Nic Cage's best role. I go back into his filmography and haven't seen anything that required him this level of heavy lifting. It's impressive that he embodies Paul without having his normal wild Cage-ism which I am grateful for. His career is very eclectic but somehow this film fits him like a well tailored suit.A must watch of 2023.",
    "54": "It has been a while since I went to the theatre and had such a great time. Dream Scenario is one of Studio A24's latest theatrical releases and it may just be their cleverest, smartest, and hilarious film of the year. The ads for this film intrigued me, but I did t expect the level of filmmaking craft put into such a whacky concept. It won't be for everyone, like many A24 films are, but if you're a film lover, I think you may love this one as I did. So let's dive into this bizarre film.Paul Matthew (Nicolas Cage) is a boring family man who wants nothing more in life than to have his book published. Out of nowhere, he begins to appear in the dreams of strangers. In these dreams, he does nothing but stands there and observe. This eventually turns into thousands, if not millions of people dreaming about him. This very quickly gives him fame, but when dreams become nightmares, it's not all sunshine and rainbows for Paul. The film's final act also deals with a lot of social commentary on our real world and virtual world in a very clever way. With the actual serious plot at hand aside, let's dive into why I had so much fun as well.Having liked Nicolas Cage as an actor for my whole life, I'll admit he has made many questionable acting choices and taken some very questionable roles over the last decade or two. He's much more out there these days, but I still always love it when he releases a new film. Well, this might be his best performance in many, many years. He brought the emotional weight of the character to the screen when the film required him to do so, but I'm also not sure if I've ever laughed this hard at a single performance in quite some time. From a scene involving a fart to his perfect line deliveries, I was laughing from start to finish. This film is entirely on his shoulders and he just ran with it. I don't think he knew he was making such an overall great film though.The visual depictions of each of the dreams in this film are all very creative and what they mean/turn into later was, quite frankly, genius. Director Kristoffer Borgli seems to have only worked mostly on short films, but this film alone will have me glancing at his small catalogue and awaiting his next big project because he has a promising future. He also wrote this film, which is why I have so much hope for him. He took an incredible concept and took it past the finish line and the final product is glorious. It was his vision and his vision completely worked for me.To wrap things up, this is an incredibly made film all around, especially taking into account that it was made for a very small budget. I will admit that the only reason I'm not saying it's nearly perfect or giving it a perfect score is for the way it concludes. The final act worked for me and blended well with the rest of the film, but I found the very final scene to be quite abrupt. Everything comes to a conclusion but I felt a scene or two more could've made the ending land slightly better for me. I can't quite put my finger on it because the entire film is superb, so I'll simply say I'm selfish and wanted a little more. Dream Scenario is now playing in theatres. It's weird and I absolutely recommend it.",
    "55": "Others have put this film as 'hilarious' and I went expecting a comedyI would not describe it as a comedy however, there was one scene I laughed out loud at .I took this film as a metaphor for how people are arbitarily cancelled.Cage put in a great performance as a professor 'cancelled' without any morale justification or evidence, and every one knows he did nothing wrong. I presume is an analagy to how 'the woke' arbitarily cancel others with a nod to hypocrisy at the end where ideas are then embraced.Other than that, I'm not really sure what this film is about and in the last 15 minutes are so I was hoping it would end soon.Would I watch it again ? NoIt's quite a dissmal / dark film (in my opinion). Don't get me wrong, it is well made, well acted (particularly by Cage) and certainly an original idea.I'm glad I watched it, but didn't particularly enjoy it 6.5/10.",
    "56": "\"I wish this was real.\"A dark story that walks along an edge between comedy and Kafkaesque nightmare, Dream Scenario tells the tale of a hapless middle-aged professor (Nicolas Cage) who suddenly achieves fame through the most unlikely of ways, by appearing in the dreams of a massive number of people. I love how creative the concept was, and that Cage took this role. He's fantastic, not over-emoting, not putting on some strange accent, just playing this frustrated, awkward guy to a tee. There are lots of funny moments, maybe none better than when he finds himself in the apartment of a woman young enough to be his daughter and she's coming on to him.Michael Cera is also brilliant as the leader of a trio at a company called Thoughts? Who seek to monetize the professor's notoriety, in conflict with his wishes to get an academic book published (one which, tellingly, he hasn't even started writing). In an interesting twist, when the professor's mood turns to frustration borne out of humiliation, his appearance in other people's dreams turns to violent nightmares. I kind of thought there might be a \"third act\" relative to what people dreamed about, but maybe its absence was an aspect of the film's originality, and how hard it is to pin down.Instead, the film begins to riff on cancel culture, as the professor finds himself going from acclaim to being a pariah, and because of things completely out of his control. He's like the zebra he's talked about in his lectures, sticking its neck out from the herd and getting noticed by predators. He vents his frustration about the over-use of the word \"trauma\" by the younger generation, and how social media, a milieu he's not very familiar with, is now destroying him. He's not the most sympathetic figure in the world, but how powerless and crushingly average he is makes him feel like a representative of one form or another. Along the way, there is also an amusing bit on those who seek to harness whatever power the professor had (which is never explained) to advertise or become dream influencers.Overall, it's a little depressing and doesn't hit a homerun or anything, but I found it inventive and engaging throughout.",
    "57": "Packing a lot of material and ideas into a single film can result in a muddled, confusing mess, no matter how well-meaning a filmmaker's intentions might be. However, in his third feature outing, writer-director Kristoffer Borgli succeeds for the most part when it comes to tackling such an imposing task. This offbeat tale of tenured but underappreciated university professor (Nicolas Cage) takes viewers on a wild ride through the diverse realms of fame, metaphysics, cancel culture, unrelenting group think, and unexpressed, underpursued desire, and the downside consequences of each. All of this comes about when the middle-aged everyman protagonist inexplicably begins showing up in the dreams of countless people, many of whom he doesn't even know. This curious oneiric anomaly - an inspired metaphor for one's presence on social media and in the public eye - quickly transforms him into an overnight viral media sensation, one that starts off with a generous showering of attention and lustful admiration but that almost as quickly leads him to become a scorned put-upon pariah. He swiftly becomes more than just yesterday's news; he turns into the object of a targeted campaign of cancel culture, hate speech and unapologetic ostracism. And, ironically, it all stems from something he never wanted nor asked for in the first place (at least in the form it ultimately took). From the foregoing description, it might sound like the filmmaker has tried to overstuff this vehicle with far too much material for viewers to process and comprehend, and there are points in the story (especially in the last half hour) where a good case could be made for that argument. However, in telling this allegorical fable, the director manages to keep the narrative's ideas distinctly sorted and in context to drive home his message, a powerful cautionary tale about the point we've collectively reached as a society with respect to these powerful and potentially damaging matters and practices. These are notions that we all need to hear but seldom do because of all the noise surrounding us that prevents us from hearing the music because of all the notes. For all this seriousness, however, \"Dream Scenario\" is loaded with hilarious, laugh-out-loud humor and fine performances all around (especially Cage and Michael Cera as an empty-headed, self-absorbed brand management expert), complemented with skillful film editing and carefully selected incidental shots that effectively punctuate the mood of many scenes. The script is generally solid, too, though it begins to stray somewhat from the material that works best in the final act, and there are a few graphically violent sequences that sensitive viewers should be wary of. On balance, though, this is the kind of production that should be made in greater numbers in an age where so many of us have lost touch with reason, our existence and ourselves. Maybe watching an offering like this could help us all sit up, think and get back on track while we still can.",
    "58": "It's a comedy horror movie set in modern times in a small university town in the United States. Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage) is a milquetoast biology prof who has always dreamed about writing a book about ants, though he hasn't started writing it yet. He's married to Janet (Julianne Nicholson); they have two daughters, Sophie (Lily Bird) and Hannah (Jessica Clement). Brett (Tim Meadows) is the dean at the university; Richard (Dylan Baker) is a colleague who is much more outgoing and popular.The movie, somewhat in the spirit of \"Twilight Zone,\" suddenly has both acquaintances and strangers to Paul having frequent dreams about Paul. Initially, he is simply a bystander to dramatic events in the dreams, but gradually, the dreams change in a more sinister direction. The movie follows changes in people's reactions to Paul and the impact of these changes on Paul and his marriage. Events spiral until, finally, entrepreneurship takes over with its own effect on Paul.\"Dream Scenario\" is a clever idea, and it especially works in college towns where we've all known professors with some of Paul's characteristics. Nicolas Cage is both funny and edgy, and Julianne Nicholson does well as his wife, who is supportive to a certain level. The script could have gone deeper with the children and Paul's university colleagues. There is good humor in Paul's erstwhile relationship with a PR firm headed by Trent (Michael Cera), and especially his assistant, Molly (Dylan Gelula).It's entertaining but not great.",
    "59": "Just back from the theater. My rating of 5/10 really reflects more my personal reaction to it, rather than how well it was done and acted. It's advertised as a comedy, but there aren't really many laughs, and I wouldn't even call it a black comedy. As we watch Paul Matthews' (Nicolas Cage) life slowly disassemble through no fault of his own, it wanders fully into the horror regime. Not some crude slasher type of thing -- stylisically this is closer to what Alfred Hitchcock might have made with the same material. And personally I just don't react well to horror -- there are twenty different things I'd rather do with my time, thanks. If I hadn't been with friends, I might not have sat through it all.Not that it's a bad production. On the contrary, it's well acted (and thus effective) and Nic Cage displays all his considerable acting skills to the full. Matthews is a sort of dumpy middle-aged professor at some small college who's a failed researcher and a rather ordinary teacher. Everything about him is ordinary. He's not dislikable but not terribly interesting or likable either, and is just generally ineffectual at everything at either work or home. He's not someone you would want to spend a lot of time with. (Paradoxically, Cage is so good at conveytng Paul's lackluster life and inner nature that he actually makes us less interested to watch!) Paul likes the momentary fame of being at the center of this unique communal dream phenomenon, but when it takes a violent turn (in the dreams, that is) he doesn't seem to know what to do, gives in to his buried rage, and ends up participating in his own destruction.There's lots of satire of modern life, like cancel culture, New Age woo-woo thinking, the emptiness of suburbia, monetization and corporatization of practically anything, and me-first attitudes -- but I felt like these were secondary to the main thread of horror/tragedy. Sorry, but not for me. The thing is that if some explanation had been given for why this communal-dream phenomenon was happening, and thus what to do about it, it would have been more in the direction of a science-fiction movie. I might have found that more interesting. When word gets around that this obscure person is appearing in all kinds of peoples' dreams, researchers would jump on it and treat it as a huge puzzle to be solved -- something that would reveal much about the brain and collective unconscious and so forth. There's no sign that any of that is happening here, it's all focussed on the reactive effects on Paul and his life. In the end I'm not sure what to take away from this thing.",
    "60": "Dream Scenario: Nicholas cage as Paul Matthews is mostly restrained considering what he's going through. He only really chews up the scenery in the dreams and once in real life when students vandallse his car. Interesting the way his appearances in dreams move on from him being just an observer of people in violent/threatening scenarios to the poinr where the film pivots into horror and he attacks, strangles, stabs people in what have now become nightmares. He goes from having disinterested students in his class to being their favourite professor but then gets effectively cancelled by them. Their dreams/nightmares become their lived experience. An interesting critique of cancel culture infuses the film, sometimes explicit but also implicit in other scenes. A Hipster PR firm firm is also used to satirise the industry, they want him to advertise Sprite and get into Obama's dreams. As he turns from hero to zero they want to push him at the Jordan Petersen demographic. Paul Matthews is basically a frumpy middle aged male, always in an anorak, he has to be asked to take it off when he;s being seduced. He holds grudges and perhaps unfairly, even irrationally believes that an old grad school colleague has stolen his ideas. An interesting observation of the male midlife crisis taken to a Fortean level. See this film! Written and Directed by Kristoffer Borgli. 8.5/10.",
    "61": "Greetings again from the darkness. David Bowie's 1975 song \"Fame\" has a line, \"Fame ... what you get is no tomorrow\", and that stuck with me during the second half of this terrific and wild film from Norwegian writer-director Kristoffer Borgli (SICK OF MYSELF, 2022). Borgli not only tackles the issue of sudden fame and the weight that goes with it, but he also comments on ego and today's cancel culture. Subtext runs throughout a film that feels descended from the mind of Charlie Kaufman and/or Spike Jonze.Oscar winner Nicolas Cage is perfectly cast as Paul Matthews, a bland Evolutionary Biology professor, living a satisfactory life with his wife Janet (the always strong Julianne Nicholson) and their two daughters Sophie (Lily Bird) and Hannah (Jessica Clement). As for his career, Paul, always dressed in a sweater and green jacket, is frumpy and awkward and an undistinguished faculty member who speaks frequently of writing a book, though he never actually writes anything.Things change quickly for Paul as he begins showing up in people's dreams. As in his life, Dream-Paul doesn't do much other than 'be there', but as the number of people who experience this grows exponentially, Paul becomes a celebrity ... leading to the publicity machine we've witnessed many times in real life. Basically, Paul goes viral. Cage masters the delivery of this line: \"Have you been dreaming about me?\", and it's the point where we recognize he is delivering an outstanding performance. When do-nothing dream-Paul turns aggressive and violent in folk's dreams (now nightmares), his experience shifts dramatically. Cancel culture kicks in and Paul becomes an outcast or pariah. Filmmaker Borgli could draw from numerous real-life situations where teachers have been dismissed for absurd reasons ... OK, maybe not as absurd as actions in a dream, yet the concept is the same.Borgli was surely inspired by Spike Jonze's excellent ADAPTATION (2002), which featured Nic Cage in a dual role (as Kaufman and his fictional brother). Although this isn't technically a dual role, Cage certainly gets to carve a wide swath through the film and through dreams ... and he appears to be having a great time doing so. Supporting work is provided by Dylan Baker, Tim Meadows, Dylan Gelula, and Kate Berlant. Michael Cera has a humorous sequence as a PR agent at a marketing firm that is trying to cash in on Paul's newfound fame as a \"dream influencer\". We even see capitalism at work in a further attempt to create an industry out of this flukey situation.The brilliance of the film stems from Borgli presenting this as an entertaining comedy-horror film with 'everyman' Paul at the center. It's a clever idea that is not-so-subtle in its willingness to show us how easily cancel culture can spin out of control and how monetizing our addiction to attention can go wrong. One specific thing that I admired in Borgli's approach was how he made Paul a normal guy, and yet, he's one of those who always believes someone has wronged him or stolen his work - despite the fact that he never actually produces any work or takes his own risk. There is so much to like about this film, not the least of which is one of Nicolas Cage's best ever performances (even in David Byrne's oversized suit).Opens in theaters on December 1, 2023.",
    "62": "DREAM SCENARIO is a very interesting movie that could generate a lot of post-viewing discussion. It asks some interesting questions about celebrity & \"cancel culture.\" It did occur to me afterwards that the movie is completely ridiculous and posits a scenario that is beyond impossible, and thus, spending a lot of time talking about its implications seems a bit silly. But, I err on the side of it being a worthwhile intellectual exercise. To say nothing of being a terrific showcase for Nicolas Cage.Cage is Paul Matthews, an aging, balding (and apparently always cold because he wears gigantic, ill-fitting coats throughout the film) tenured professor at a modest college. His students pay little attention to him (even though, to be honest, it seems like he's a more interesting professor than many I experienced myself). He leads a frustrating professional life. Early in the film, he has lunch with an very distant colleague who is preparing to publish a paper that touches on subjects that Matthews worked on decades ago. He feels these topics still somehow belong to him, and wants some credit for the paper. He mentions that he's working on a book on the topic...but it turns out he hasn't actually started writing the thing. It's an idea he has and apparently has had for many years. He's a guy who imagines doing great or interesting things, but it will never happen for him. We meet his loving wife (Julianne Nicholson, always under-rated) and his doting daughters. From the viewer's perspective, he's a bit of schlub. An uninspiring instructor, eaten up by his own failures, and sadly unable to see that his great family really means he's got it pretty darn good. Nice house. Nice kids. Nice wife.But he's a bit clueless. And when he suddenly starts appearing in the dreams of millions of people around the world, he becomes a clueless celebrity (or at least, cultural phenomena). His classroom is full of people who want a selfie with him. He's on the news. He's written about. He's beloved. And he's done nothing to deserve the positive accolades. For some strange reason, he is a background character in the dreams of millions of strangers. He just hovers there, really doing nothing. But just the fact that he's at the center of this weird thing makes him popular. And when talent agents come calling, he sees his opportunity to get a book deal.But then, things go abruptly wrong, and he goes from saint to demon overnight. None of it is his fault, but he's suddenly a pariah. And he handles it very, very badly...putting at risk everything good in his life.It's all so unfair. Paul did NOTHING to make these dreams happen. The \"character\" he is in the dreams bears no resemblance to his true persona. He is right to rail against his vilification. Yet his own unpleasant character traits tee us up to NOT sympathize with him. Does he have it coming? Did his own flaws somehow taint his benign dream persona? Why doesn't the public understand that the dream Paul and the real Paul have nothing to do with each other?It's all very interesting, and Cage makes it all matter thanks to the best performance he's given in some time. With this movie and the excellent, over-looked PIG...Cage demonstrates his true acting chops. Yes, he's delightful in THE UNBEARABLE WEIGHT OF MASSIVE TALENT, but even in well-received films like THE COLOR OUT OF SPACE, his performances are over-the-top and even unhinged.Enjoyable...absolutely. But fine acting? No. He's always a bit broad in his performances, but DREAM SCENARIO harnesses his energy and spins Paul Matthews into a complex character we can understand and feel things about. The script is tight and energetic and clever and funny. The supporting cast (again, special kudos to Nicholson) is on the right wavelength. And the questions the film asks are very relevant in our time of social media, overnight sensations and overnight demonizations. It's a fun film on the surface, very much worth it for Cage's well-done work...but it also rewards some reflection and discussion. I heartily recommend it.",
    "63": "The hilarious start of this movie is to die for! It made me curious as heck! After a wonderfully joyful start it veers into darker territory though!What supposedly starts out as a quirky comedy, halfway through really flipped sides and became a great tale of the vulnerabilities of those who are famous and stand out from the crowd. It's a character portrait and an allegory firstmost, \"disguised\" as a quirky comedy.Beware: this is not a laugh out loud comedy (although still quite witty and really quirky), but it is a very intelligent allegory, best suited for an arthouse movie crowd I guess.The story is about lots of people suddenly having dreams about a boring professor (Nicholas Cage) who appears in their dreams, wherein he basically is doing nothing, just passing by. What's going on here?I wont start saying (again) that Nicholas Cage is back, because this truly brilliant actor has been on a lucky streak of several actor's gems in a row for some years now! And this is another one of his very best acting performances!Highly recommended for the art house movie fans of quirky and intelligent comedies. Memories of the best of Charlie Kaufman's work (\"Being John Malkovich\", \"Adaptation\") come to mind when watching this wonderful trip of a story.I APPLAUD the writer AND director Kristoffer Borgli for writing this marvellous allegory, brilliantly directed, with every techinical detail (photography, editing, sound) being simply superb.What a trip.

It was an Excellent Performance that Services the Plot so well.4.

It's already been nominated for a couple of awards. Congrats!THINGS I LIKED:\nI love that Nicolas Cage is making such a positive comeback. He took a professional nose dive there for a number of years, but he has so many raving fans who think he's hilarious and awesome so much so that his recent films have been hits. Here's another film they're going to love. He does a great job creating a character that you feel sorry for as he transforms from a self-absorbed professor to a caged animal.The entire cast does a great job and includes Julianne Nicholson, Michael Cera, Tim Meadows, Dylan Baker, and more.There's talk of keeping a dream journal. Have you ever done that? One of my sons has been doing that for years and is fascinated by what he could learn from his dreams and if he can do lucid dreaming.The film does an excellent job of taking a satirical look at what we do to be appreciated and get recognition from others. It reminds us not to dream our life away, wishing for our life to be a certain way while we don't take action to make those dreams come true. There's a great line from another movie I just reviewed that is applicable to this movie's theme: \"If you talk about something, it's a dream. If you envision it, it's a possibility. If you schedule it, it's reality.\" Check out my review of What Happens Later!I loved the analogy of the zebras and how their stripes are designed to help them blend in with each other in order to keep them safe. It's an interesting idea considering that so many people want to be unique and noticed. Did you know a group of zebras is called a \"Dazzle\"? Cute!THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nA better title could have been something like \"Sweet Dreams\" or \"Dreams and Nightmares\". What do you think?Act 3 feels a bit uneven from Acts 1 & 2.TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nTalk of sexual fantasies\nSome profanity with F-bombs\nA middle-aged, married man makes out with a college girl\nFarting\nViolence with blood\nWe see people die brutal deaths.To see my full review, go to my YouTube channel called Movie Review Mom!",
    "67": "The first half of 'Dream Scenario (2023)' is genuinely great, mainly due to just how funny it is. It's honestly downright hilarious at times, probably one of the funniest films I've seen in a while. It has a very specific sense of humour that feels rooted entirely in character, rather than overt jokes if that makes any sense, and it's darkly comedic even as it pivots from awkward encounters to downright horrific ones. For as successful that gradual yet marked shift in underlying tone is, however, it's also one of the things that eventually causes the movie to loose its footing somewhat. That's because its second half descends into yet another false-accusation story of cancel culture 'gone wrong' wherein an innocent man's life is ruined because of what people think he has done or might do that can also be interpreted as a failure to separate art from artist. These themes are annoying because they do play to genuine fears and frustrations - after all, someone being punished for something they didn't do is always going to be unsettling - but they're also problematic because they're entirely over-represented in media and subconsciously reinforce the notion that the real victims of all these scenarios are the accused rather than the accusers, further sowing seeds of doubt into the legitimacy of every occasion that someone comes forward to report some form of abuse. It's unfortunate that the flick feels the need to move so blatantly in this direction, as it isn't the only path it could have gone down and it feels like one of the least interesting routes it could have taken. It's not as if it's ever overtly bad, of course, but it does come uncomfortably close to dismissing - even decrying - certain parts of our culture which are actually rather important. At the same time, it does feel a little confused when it comes to the target of its overall satire; some select moments don't quite fit within the meta narrative it seems to be trying to create for the majority of its second movement and the start of its third act is marked by an interesting but partially out-of-left-field and severely under-explored shift in prey. It actually drops the ball the hardest in its final segment because this part is unfulfilling both in retrospect (as is the second) and in the moment (an entirely new issue). Thankfully, the final scene is legitimately fantastic, a poignant mixture of touching happiness and profound tragedy that leaves things on an undeniably strong note and goes a long way in reducing the impact of the story's otherwise somewhat disappointing culmination. It probably sounds like I'm not too big a fan of the film, but it's actually one of the best I've seen so far this year even in its final state. I'm more downhearted about it because its first half implies it's going to be far greater than it ultimately is; if it had continued on that course, perhaps it could be fighting for one of the top spots in this year's ranking. Still, the overall result is an incredibly well-made and engaging experience. It's worth pointing out that Nicolas Cage puts in, for my money, one of his best performances to date as he truly nails his pathetic, increasingly put-upon character and absolutely nails the comedic timing needed to make even the most awkward and sad scenarios quietly amusing. The direction is consistently unconventional, too, and the editing is simply sublime, making keen use of considered non-linearity to further both the humour and the story while also keeping you on your toes thanks to its occasional unwillingness to clue you into to what's a dream until that dream is over. Again, I have to stress that this film is funny, unexpectedly so. In fact, one scene had me laughing so much that I was concerned I wouldn't be able to stop and would disturb the other people in the screening. The comedy never undercuts the character work, though, so even the funniest of moments also give us insight into those involved and push them further along their own individual arcs. It works really well as a character study, taking someone whose main traits are being awkward, pathetic, vain and generally uninteresting and using the inherent dark comedy that can come with that to really dig deep into how that person thinks and how they're going to react when forced into an absolutely absurd situation. It works better on this more insular level than it does as a piece of satire, even if it does have its finger on the pulse in some areas and is able to make some keenly chucklesome observations on occasion. The whole 'wrongly accused white male' element is tired and potentially harmful, and the picture does get significantly less successful as it moves towards its final third. Still, it's a really strong effort overall despite being significantly dampened by the direction it decides to go in. It's a pleasant surprise and it's definitely worth a watch.",

It's mostly about a sort of nobody guy whom you don't hate but has unlikable flaws and don't care what happens to him.

He is semi-content in his ivory tower until a sudden fame involuntarily catapults him into a trending celebrity, which he manages to milk for his own advantage. But as a proverbial knowledge, fame cuts both ways. When his virality turns even more bizarrely threatening and negative, is he capable of reconciling with it? Similarly, Borgli's script opts for a noncommittal way to wind up Paul's plight, and Cage's participation also harks back to the star's own notoriety as an internet meme years ago. But it is irksome when the ending arbitrarily cranks up the weird \"dream scenario\" to commodification without explicating Paul's phenomenon. All of a sudden, one can purchase the experience to enter another person's dream, but the grounds about our \"patient zero\" is frustratingly unforthcoming, the leap of scientific and technological advancement leaves an oceanic lacuna in Borgli's script.\"read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, please google it, thanks.",

The story is so well told, both through the excellent script by also what is NOT said. The acting was stellar throughout- especially by Cage in the lead role.Nobody else could play this role but Nicolas Cage, who inhabits the character with utter honesty and devastating humanity.Doubtless this movie will go on as one of the best of the year, and one of Cage's top 2 or 3 acting roles.",
    "71": "Dreams are a fascinating phenomenon. The malleability of a dreamscape is a source of endless possibility, reaching into the depths of one's mind manifesting unconscious thoughts. Dream Scenario plays with this concept in clever ways through both its cinematography and plot. Borgli smartly uses quick cuts and rapid changes in lighting to blur the line between the dreamscape and reality of the film, mirroring the main character's journey.Nick Cage plays an incredibly banal and painful uncool man named Paul who gets thrust into the public spotlight as a result of his spontaneous and miraculous popping up in people's dreams. At first, this is a boon to his otherwise unextraordinary life. He uses it to impress his kids, to entertain his students, and to impassion his wife. Crucially however, Paul has not changed. He is not his dream self. The way he is perceived by society is not a product of his reality. In this way his fame is wholly arbitrary. Instead, his reality becomes a product of the way he is perceived. There is a clear satirical bend to having fame thrust on such an unexceptional person and it produces some genuine laughs, but I also loved how the film could marry that comedy with sinister undertones.Paul, like all of us, wants to be special. And if he was always thinking clearly, he would realize that having a loving wife and two children is something special in and of itself. He would realize that he cannot be the man of people's dreams. Still, the intoxicating appeal of fame is understandable, and he remains a sympathetic if pitiable and painfully uncool protagonist. It is difficult to look away while his life gets spun off in directions he had no ability to predict.Dream Scenario has much to say about the price of fame, the desire to be great, and the dangers of technology affecting the way we connect with each other. But it has in equal or greater measure some profoundly funny moments built upon an incredibly raw and earnest performance from Cage (reminiscent of his work in Adaptation). Some of the commentary was a little on the nose, and I would have liked to see a bit more character transformation from Cage, but the shot composition, smart writing, and dedicated performance from Cage really make this film worthwhile.",
    "72": "When college professor \"Matthews\" (Nicolas Cage) starts appearing in the dreams of strangers (oh, and his wife!), his whole life is turned topsy-turvy. Initially it's all a rather benign phenomenon with his appearances fleeting, inconclusive and harmless. Until, that is, he meets one person who has been having a rather more intimate experience. Not only does this meeting not go very well (on various levels!) but it seems to change the very nature of the illusions for everyone, turning them more into nightmares... A predictable, occasionally violent, backlash ensues which makes the man's life - and that of his family - all but insufferable. What to do now his fame has come back to bite him? I quite enjoyed the first half hour of this quirky and entertainingly written drama. Cage is always rather good at taking the rise out of himself, and he seems to be enjoying the ride at the start. Once the story turns a bit darker, though, it runs out of steam. It's charm and uniqueness becomes rather subsumed in a rather unsubtle whack at the \"cancel culture\" that exists amongst those who live their lives via social media. It's not the first or the best to draw a parallel between what's real and what's fact - even when such distinctions are easily identifiable, and after a while I felt the film had no clear idea of how to conclude without actually proving it's own, rather depressing, point. The idea is interesting, the delivery is fine - but the end product is all a bit underwhelming.",
    "73": "\"Do you think I have the emotional maturity to carry on an affair?\" Paul Matthews (Nicholas Cage)Few Nicholas Cage characters could be accused of having emotional maturity. Now he has gone about as far as an actor can go with the satire Dream Scenario, helmed by Norwegian, LA-based Kristoffer Borgli. Together with producer Ari Aster (Hereditary), Borgli has ventured into the rare arena of \"surrealist horror-comedy.\"Paul Matthews is a tenured professor who suddenly finds he's inhabiting others' dreams, most often in strange silence and motionless. For the first instance, his daughter Sophie (Lily Bird) has a dream of objects falling from the sky as she begins to levitate and he dumbly watches.For the obvious academic world, he's expressing the nightmare frequently of impressing, especially younger students, with his hidden psycho-sexual urges and his longing to have students desire him. As he tries to migrate to branding with the help of a skctchy ad agency and a hot, young intern Molly( Dylan Gelu).Yet, this is not just the mixed-up Freudian underworld of a professor, for anyone who has taught, performed, or played political, the psyches of those who see us do our thing are usually excluded from our knowing. In one particularly insightful sequence, he inhabits the dream scenario of Molly, with whom he has an uncomfortable sexual encounter in that dream world. In her dream, he expresses his reservations about the difference in their ages and eventually doesn't perform well thanks to a comically-placed fart, even after the act was successful in a previous dream.Beyond the sexual, Matthews suffers the ignominy of being universally known to inhabit violent dreams and therefore held in contempt as any public figure might be. Subsequently the cancel culture condemns him, calling for his academic head, he being protected by his tenure but not immune from his growing lust for fame.Dream scenario takes several paths to display Matthews' existential mix up, none of which is dull and all suggesting more about our fragile psyches longing to be accepted and revered. When his academic and public heads are being called for, Matthews is tapping our innermost anxieties about being cancelled and ignored. Cage continues to explore his and our place in the human zoo, and he's darn good at it.I suspect Cage, with his filmography of more than 120 entries, is searching for an identity in addition to loving his craft and paying sizeable alimonies. His recent Pig shows his considerable acting talent, and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, in which he plays himself in an action-comedy, lets him comfortably inhabit multiple genres.His Oscar was not a fluke-he is a consummate actor.",
    "74": "Dream Scenario is an utterly compelling and unique film headed by a once again remarkably captivating Nicolas Cage.It follows Cage's Paul Matthews, a seemingly ordinary man who discovers that he has become a starring feature in multiple people's dreams. As the phenomenon spreads, Paul must learn to navigate the consequences that it brings.As a concept I found it to be really unique, and it allows for a lot of playfulness and creativity in the story telling. I never really quite knew where it was going which kept me hooked throughout. It makes for a really fun and absorbing screenplay that will put you through a range of emotions.Of course, one of the highlights of the film is Nicolas Cage, who I think deserves to be spoken about in the greatest actor of all time conversations. He masterfully treads between comedy and drama and even horror at times as he takes Paul on this wild journey. It's an accomplished performance from an actor who inexplicably seems to be going from strength to strength at this stage in his career.There isn't really much more to say about this film. It is just a treat. Fun, dark, dramatic, unique, and with a brilliant performance at it's core.",
    "75": "Nicolas Cage has said this is the best movie he has done, and I agree.He plays the role of an evolutionary biology professor whose real-life dreams (in the aspirational sense) are never pursued; instead, they are co-opted by others while he is something of a background NPC. Then he seems to begin appearing in other people's dreams in the same passive bystander. Eventually, he becomes famous for that - winning for losing, you might say. His story goes viral, and as a result he is showered with the attention he has been striving for all of his life. Unfortunately, it is not for having accomplished anything worthwhile. Cage and Norwegian director Kristoffer Borgli use this as a springboard for commentary on hive mentality, cultural insanity, commercialization (especially with regard to the commoditization of self), and fame.I am almost certain this movie was inspired by the \"This Man\" incident that went viral back in 2006. Some of you may recall that a psychiatric patient drew the face of a man who had been appearing repeatedly in her dreams. One day, another patient saw it and said he, too, had seen \"this man\" in his dreams. He showed it to his colleagues and more patients began saying that they, too, had seen \"this man\" in their dreams. Now, over 8,000 people have jumped on the bandwagon, claiming to have seen \"this man\" in their dreams, as well. The drawing of \"this man\" is still online and people continue to claim that he has appeared in their dreams even thgouh they have never seen him before.I'm going to avoid spoilers, but I do want to call attention to one early scene in the movie. During a lecture, Professor Mathews (Cage) is talking to the class about zebras. Black and white stripes, he says, do not camouflage them in their natural environment. (Brown or green would be better camouflage there.) He points out that these colors camouflage them very well within the zebra environment, though.Norwegian director Kristoffer Borgli's comment on this movie:\"We spend a lot of our lives dreaming in bed, but we also spend our waking life mostly in our heads too. I feel like we're not participating in reality as much as we are thinking about our past or the imagined future at any moment. That is a big part of the experience of life. I thought of this movie as a possibility of going there and exploring that.\"\nHe also commented, \"I'm scared of the American model winning over.... (T)his future we're spiraling toward is on my mind a lot....\" It has been on my mind a lot, too. Maybe that is why this movie resonated with me.Finally, the movie pays homage to David Bryne and the Talking Heads (a band that was famous in the 20th century) twice. One time during a dream scenarios and then again at the end, when their song, \"City of Dreams\" plays during the end credits.If you like standard Hollywood fare, you probably won't like this film. If you're a fan of irrationally ostracizing people, you certainly are not going to like this film. If you watch movies to escape modern realities, this film might disappoint you. But if you don't mind thinking a little and being exposed to relevance every now and then, I encourage you to go see it.",
    "76": "Director Kristoffer Borgli provides an insanely bizarre, yet interesting narrative with great characters, direction, satirical themes, camerawork and strong performances from the cast members. The movie perfectly balances out the satirical themes of perception, reality, and cancel culture that feels strong, hilarious and quite insane. Many of the production, costumes, visual effects, and the camerawork are great and felt purposeful. The performances are great as Nicolas Cage is amazing as it's nice to see Cage playing a character rather than being himself. Alongside the other actors as well since their performances were able to make the characters interesting and hilarious to observe. The soundtrack from Owen Pallett is outstanding, the editing and technical aspects are great, and the uses of dark humor is balanced and used appropriately.I laughed quite a lot during this movie. My only few complaints are that there are some dialogue that felt a bit clunky and certain style choices feel way too similar to something like Charlie Kaufman would do.Overall, it's pretty insane and I absolutely loved it. Definitely will not be for everyone but it's worth a watch. I look forward to seeing what Borgli provides next.",
    "77": "Nicolas Cage gives one of his most multi-dimensional performances ever that only rarely lurches into his trademark torrents. In this film, he's a mundane, middle-aged professor teaching abstruse subjects, who through some inexplicable happenstance starts appearing in the dreams of most people. He becomes an instant celebrity and a budding pop culture icon... that is, until people's dreams about him take on a certain character.The film's tone ranges from whimsical to dark humor to mournful and there are a lot of ideas at work here, not just the central concepts of social commentary on the harshness of cancel culture and the unruly state of the subconscious. The gnawing struggle against mediocrity, the fickle nature of coolness, the fear of eternal loserdom and the impact of frayed nerves are all touched upon at various points through Cage's polite but chagrined eyes. Although this film clearly has a lot on its mind, it doesn't become overly philosophical and seemingly cashes in its chips as it heads into its final chapter. On the positive side, it's an eloquent depiction of the psychological toll that sudden fame takes on those unprepared and unfamiliar with it.Although this film is far from flawless, it's still a workmanlike mix of oddball hilarity and weird escapism. For viewers willing to let go and run with the foibles of offbeat storytelling and wild swings in narrative tone, this is strongly recommended.",
    "78": "When it comes to A24, they sure do know how to make things awkward, uncomfortable, and disturbing. Dream Scenario is no different.This evening some friends of mine treated ourselves to a double feature starting with Dream Scenario (which I guess my friend didn't care to much for as he walked out half way through not to be seen til movie number two.) Movie number two being Silent Night.So Dream Scenario, how do I describe this film other than unique. It was different and weird but in a good way. Nicolas Cage brings out a creepiness that I can't explain but is something he just naturally has. Coupled with A24s natural ability to push awkwardness, you get a film that is strongly uncomfortable and disturbing in the best of ways.The story is well told and is well written. The supporting cast is doing just as good. From start to finish, Dream Scenario is a solid film.However...I feel the film started to fall apart a bit in its third act. They started to delve into some clear social commentary that I felt wasn't executed properly. The build-up to this third act was good as everything in the film was done considerably well, especially the atmosphere and tone. But as the third act kept going, all I could think was, \"we need to start bringing this to an end.\" Not because it was bad but because I couldn't see what, \"the point\" was or where this was going. I just felt we needed to reach a natural conclusion.The films conclusion, I must say, did leave me with a bit more to be desired. It wasn't terrible but not completely satisfying.Nonetheless, Dream Scenario was enjoyable, and I could see myself watching again in the near future.IMDb: 7/10\nLetterboxd: 3/5Watched in Theaters.",
    "79": "This is a must watch movie\nAfter years scratching out average movies Cage triumphs in this take that's much deeper than its central plot.This movie has far reaching implications touching on many aspects of modern life including how people judge people on hearsay as well as how the media can twist perceptions of truth and realityI rarely give movie plots away and I don't intend to do so on this review.What i can say is that whoever wrote this script really understood the human psyche, especially of young university students who are easily impressionable and too often lack any fibre.The plot also underscores the insincerity and manipulation of the advertising and PR industries.Go see this movie.It will get into your head.",
    "80": "Dream ScenarioThis was such a strange movie. The premise is simple to describe but complex to grasp. An ordinary man, who is so awkward at times that be prepared to cringe, suddenly starts appearing in people's dreams. At first it's cute as the phenomenon goes viral, but it turns dark very fast.Nicolas Cage has done some fun movies over the years, but he is downright hilarious as the confused, befuddled professor who is thrust into a situation that cannot possibly be understood.So the questions I posed to myself are:Do you think that dreams are a reflection of what one experiences in their perception of the world?Do you think that dreams are completely random hallucinations that have no meaning?Do you think that dreams can be fantasies of what either might have been, or might happen?And can a person, who is the subject of another's dream, be held accountable for their actions, if one of the above questions may prove true?Good luck figuring all that out. Enjoy the dark comedy.",
    "81": "Am I alone in seeing this film as an indictment of our meme-happy culture? There's even a line in Dream Scenario that encapsulates the core theme: \"All memes will become dreams.\"Never underestimate the power of a meme to evoke the full spectrum of human emotions - from laughter to terror to sexual titillation. Nicholas Cage as Paul Matthews becomes the world's most famous walking, talking meme - a social media post made manifest, and violently thrown to the mercy of mob.Matthews could be seen as a metaphor - a mirror into the dark recesses of peoples' souls, dredging up what are for the most part the blackest Jungian archetypes residing in the caverns of our reptilian brains. Cage's character becomes a dowdy, dorky Freddy Krueger, ready to serve as the least likely universal Boogie Man imaginable!Fortunately for us in the real world, viewing memes rarely leads to psychic meltdowns; most are innocuous attempts at wit and tongue-in-cheek news reporting; and many bring us vitally needed humor to keep the nerd demon depicted in Dream Scenario at bay.Bottom line: this film will appeal to those who find humor in some gore and cringe, and who are confident enough in their own sanity to be immune to the banal demonic charm of Nicholas Cage's meme man.",
    "82": "I expected this film to take some sort of sinister turn, and to some extent it does. However, this movie is more analytical than anything. We're introduced to our main character, Paul, in an obvious dream scenario where he stands by doing nothing at all as the dream carries on. Snapping back to reality, we are then introduced to Paul's family and lifestyle. Seemingly an average family man, Paul's life shifts into that of a celebrity's after randomly popping up in thousands of stranger's dreams. Paul does nothing but stand by watching in most of these dreams, while others see Paul more involved in one way or another. Seeing this as an opportunity to help further his career and get his book off the ground, Paul takes advantage of his newly found popularity, though fame is not always as joyous as it seems. The cinematography really reminded me of that of the 1970's, just the way scenes were framed and/or blocked. I was mesmerized at times. The performances throughout were well done. I can't imagine anyone else playing Paul other than Nicolas Cage, it's really what makes this movie THIS movie. Even seeing his photo in the film will make you chuckle. Overall, a cute, bizarre, worthwhile picture. This is a movie where you actually want to listen to someone tell you their dreams. Riddled with bits of drama, humor, satire, social commentary, and even horror, this film pleasantly surprised me."
