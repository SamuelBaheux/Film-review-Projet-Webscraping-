    "0": "Difficult to say what the point of this was. It starts of quite well but the longer it goes on, the worse it gets. Any apocalypse movie can be interesting in the beginning - when neither the audience nor the characters know what's going on. The difficult part is to make the reasons for the apocalypse make sense and to make the rest of the movie interesting.The premise is interesting, but as soon as the characters start to put the pieces together, the movie ends abruptly. It is one of the weirdest endings I've ever seen. The characters had only solved about 80% of the mystery and it would be interesting to know what would happen next.This whole movie feels like an intro. It feels like a pilot episode of a TV-show. Perhaps they forgot to film the rest of the movie? But I also don't think there was much more to build with after the credits rolled. Still, an enjoyable movie with a great cast - Mahershala Ali was phenomenal.",
    "1": "I can enjoy slow character-driven movies.....as long as there is a payoff for the slowness.This movie is similar to M. Night original movies, where you as the viewer do not know anymore then the characters in the story. That was nice and refreshing. There were purposeful plot devices that kept you guessing on what was real or not. Again, pretty good so far. Several scenes could have used some editing and easily cut out 40+ minutes of filler, but still okay as long as you have a payoff.Problem is, there is no payoff. So instead of enjoying a slow build, instead you feel as if the movie wasted your time. If the movie had a ending, I could have enjoyed it, but it didn't. The movie credits starts running and you are left with 'WTF?'. Lazy, this is one of those directors have has a good idea, but not sure how to end their project, so they leave it open-ended under the guise of 'audience interpretation'. Dumb.Other things to note, none of the characters are likeable. The young girl is as stupid and mentally challenged as the 'Hereditary' girl, someone who should be watched 24/7 but the parents thinks it is okay to let them go out alone.",
    "2": "Started out with lots of promise for a thoughtful, tense thriller. But unfortunately that didn't come to pass. And unfortunately the ending didn't make up for the thin soup we were asked to digest for the previous hour and a half.I can't even say the acting was terrific, because it just seemed so . . . Adequate. And the direction was off and on, with some really good moments but way too many closeups of faces just wordlessly. . . Looking.Bless them all for trying but it just didn't hold my attention. Although I hung in there until what I hoped would be a revelatory and redeeming ending. But alas, no.",
    "3": "Almost. The storyline was interesting. That's what had me intrigued. Especially with the cast! I mean, you can't go wrong with Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, and Kevin Bacon!!Except, you can. You can go way wrong with such an exceptional cast. I'll say this much, because again, I don't like to tell the whole movie, it'll have you waiting for something to happen. I waited for 2 hours for something as small as an explanation or a hint of what's going on here.The scenes changed without a clue as to what you just watched. I even thought the herd of 100 deer would at least give me some insight but no. Nothing. It was even a part where the buck emerged from the group, looking like he was ready to explain what's going on, but to my dismay, nothing.The ending was worse. It just ended. Wham bam, thank you ma'am. Left me with more questions than your average 5 year old in a museum. Since I can't get those 2 hours back, I'll give you 2 minutes of my time. Avoid this movie like the Plague, no, like we did Covid in 2020. You've been warned.",
    "4": "What in the ever lovin F$!& was this movie all about? I was actually pretty intrigued. This was some sort of apocalyptic alien. Invasion type of thriller. And I was pleasantly surprised that the family that is typical in these movies was not some sort of whiny, spoiled brat, dysfunctional group. Mom tempted me at times two rethink that, but she eventually grew on me by the end. But after 3/4 of the way through, there was absolutely no advancement of the plot. You can chalk this up to some creative license or someone trying to be funny about not really telling the full story but damn, this just ended with absolutely nothing to go on. None of the characters arcs were fulfilled. Like Period. Who the hell wants to spend two hours watching a movie that has no ending!?",
    "5": "Three 1980s icon stars. Julia robers, ethan hawk and kevin bacon in a world disaster movie. Wow, i want to see that.But it gets worse and worse over time. Leaving tons of plot holes and ending in a no ending.It falls apart so hard that you feel kinda stunned, like someone must have snuck in and just ended the movie before the real end.They talk a ton about the wife but we never get to see her so why did they push for it so hard? The son claimed to be stung by a bug and his teeth fall out, no explanation. They go to the neigbour for meds although they have no clue if the meds will somehow cure him and then they have a flashback from 2 seconds before...its a mess. Everything is a mess in this movie.You will be able to list 100 left plot points that leads nowhere and was just sort of forgotten about. Its a terrible movie with a great premise.",
    "6": "For over 2 hours, this movie shows the first hours and days after the loss of satellite communications on Earth. The result is the collapse of all civilian life within a short time. And just before anarchy takes over, the film ends. But the little girl is happy because she has found what matters the most to her in the bunker and she is safe.Such an event would not only occur if a hidden enemy caused these things to happen. It is not even clear whether that was the cause in the case of the film. These things can also be caused by cosmic rays, geomagnetic storms and solar flares, which occur regularly. On average, once in less than a millennium. These are known as Miyake events. The last known event that had a significant impact was the Carrington event in 1859.The consequences of such an event would be far more threatening today than in 1859. It would throw us back to the Stone Age. Such geomagnetic storms destroy electronic circuits, semiconductors etc. This was not an issue back then since these haven't been invented yet. Nowadays it would be a huge problem. The entire planet is in the hands of semiconductors and computers.No matter what the cause was in the film, watching what it would be like if this horror happened nowadays is thrilling because it's a 100 % realistic threat.The actors do a great job - that's not just an empty phrase. The cinematography is great. The CGI is impressive. This movie deserves a rating above 7 stars. I am not sure what causes all of these bad reviews story-wise, and what these people do expect.The movie's message: what has the modern life made of us? We are focused on technology and ourselves and have lost what makes us human. Perhaps a reset would help, at least in that regard.",
    "7": "Facing the apocalypse in a unique way is not an easy thing to do in movies, but director/screenwriter Sam Esmail takes Rumaan Alam's 2020 novel and turns it into an unrelenting 2023 psychological thriller that captures the current extremist political landscape and isolationist world view with sharp acuity. No one real is explicitly mentioned, but so much of the threat presented in the spiraling plot felt not only relevant but palpable. It starts with a last-minute family vacation in a Long Island mansion and the two strangers who enter their lives. Julia Roberts plays an unapologetically mistrustful woman with familiar conviction, while Ethan Hawke does what he can as her laid-back husband. As the mysterious stranger, Mahershala Ali has to play it close to the vest, while Kevin Bacon has an effective turn late in the story. I could've done without some of the contrived camera angles and predictable music cues, but overall the film got me thinking what I would do under similar circumstances.",
    "8": "Wow I was initially flustered because I had read several bad reviews but then flabbergasted when it turned out to be a stupendously entertaining movie.Anyone that didn't understand what the movie was about simply lack simple comprehension skills. Especially after Ali's final diatribe and the message that scrolls in the bunker's computer in the end. Also anyone calling this boring has no idea what a good movie is. Stellar, subtle performances from the entire cast though Ali as usual excels. Robert's character and to a lesser degree Ali's daughter are fairly unlikabke throughout ( why Hollywood keeps insisting on making most women eternally angry is quite\nperplexing and vexing ) though they both have a good moment in their final scene together. The direction is also exemplary and the tension and mystery builds and rarely lets up. This could have easily been a series with flashbacks on the characters and many\nunanswered questions since the movie is open ended. It's also a bit scary in what could possibly happen in the near future with today's tense political climate. It gets one less star because of some of the awful music that is played, especially early on but the score itself is quite good and adds to the tension and suspense in many scenes. Overall a fantastic, entertaining movie that we quite enjoyed.",
    "9": "This was really good, in my opinion.It was weird seeing Roberts play an unlikable woman but she grew toward the end.Lots of suspense, no handholding or explanations.The scariest part is that our society is doing exactly what this movie warns about; great divides, one side against the other, polarization.Other countries don't need to do much when a countries own people are so divided.The deers and animals were weird, but I guess something in the noises were affecting their navigation? I don't think an EMP would do that but the one guy mentioned microwave weapons like in cuba...maybe that can? I have no idea.There was a lot left unanswered, but that's how it would really be in this sort of situation, if the grid went down and there was no way to communicate. Nobody would know what is really going on.The boys teeth fall out; how does no one suspect radiation poisoning until the prepper mentions it? That was weird.The little girl's focus on Friends helps her find the bunker so hopefully she'll share the location with her family. I think that was a comment on how we as a society need the escape that movies and tv bring, but again, who knows.I really enjoyed this but would have rather it been a series instead of a movie. I would have enjoyed seeing more instead of having the ending left up in the air like that.Sorry if I'm not making much sense; I have a migraine and took some painkillers.",
    "10": "Wow, they really cranked the engagement (+tension) levels all the way up to eleven here. And for what it's worth, the source material (a novel of the same name by Rumaan Alam) feels like it carries that page-turner quality. I guess there was one major change from the novel, and that was with Myha'la Herrold's character. The ensemble truly shine, and it's good to see Julia Roberts return to doing solid work after a mediocre Ticket to Paradise. Ethan Hawke is a go-to for daddy roles like this nowadays, and he aces it, as expected. The true standout is Mahershala Ali, in a role that first makes us think he's a creepy home-invader, but then, the man is full of sophistication and good taste, ain't he? For instance, his casual revelations may sound like conspiracy theories, but he delivers them in a style that makes you want to believe. Roberts, on the other hand, is displaying all kinds of cynicism and vulnerability, and her character becomes easier to like once the surface layers are peeled off. The two kids are promising too.For writer-director Sam Esmail, this feels like natural progression after all the work he put into Mr. Robot. The visual effects are thankfully solid, and if they'd been subpar, this film would've been half as effective. There are stretches where the protagonists are just confused and unsure what to do, given the distinct nature of the circumstances, and it's because the writing (especially, the dialogues) is strong that the film stays riveting all through 2h 20m. You can argue that the makers tried to blend too many things here, including bits of body horror (ouch, those teeth!) and dark comedy (screaming at the deer), and I think it's to their credit that it all somehow makes for a coherent, mostly thrilling ride. The ending feels rather simplistic for a film that offers various kinds of commentary, and while it made me smile, I'm not sure how I feel about it as \"storyline closure\".P. S. Wasn't Kevin Bacon THE perfect choice to play the unhinged neighbor?",
    "11": "What a disgrace. Netflix just can't nail the slow burn no matter who they hire or how much cash they throw at them. This had amazing potential. Maybe the book was really good. But this was just a long drawn out slow shuffle to nowheresville. Even when the movie ends it's like it just stops. No ending. No climax. The narrative just comes to an end. Some decent acting talent and nice scenery, but the director's use of weird, amateurish camera angles gave me a headache and made the whole movie seem like a USC student film that didn't have a script or story. All in all this is just typical drainage from Netflix.",
    "12": "Despite the great cast and acting, in my opinion this movie was a huge failure. It is not that it has no message, but that it has a message that makes no sense, or the message that makes the nonsense. There are a lot of movies these days after which instead of being at least no smarter one gets actually dumber in a world that has no shortage of dumb people already. For this one it is really worth reading some spoilers before seeing it. It is about the civil divide in the American society of which its enemies take advantage to throw America into civil war and total self-destruction (...by enemies, meaning enemies united ...Koreans - presumably North, China, Rusia, Iran, and whoever else, all presumably agreed on this common strategy) America gets hacked and destroyed and some animals (deer and birds) behave strange like they seemingly know something, which is a major clue in the story along with something unclear space related (sun, solar storm? ...or not solar storm, flag on the moon, maybe aliens?), why not some weird disease that makes protagonists vomit blood and their teeth fall, which could be some top-secret radiation weapon, but may be Lyme disease, or we turn all into zombies. I guess they managed to cover everything.Inevitably when you see something your brain updates its wiring. In this case you get a bad update in the age of bad updates.Not to forget a quote that addresses the subject of racism by the main progressist character in the movie: \"I don't trust these people because they are white.\" ...now in all fairness imagine how righteous this is by imagining a white person saying that about black people.",
    "13": "This is one that if you make through the majority of the movie, you are just praying for it to end. We looked for how much is left multiple times to see how much more torture we would be exposed to. It's not just he ending bad, the entire film is a set of poorly related scenes and events that make zero sense. Just don't waste your time and eyes on this POS, BS boring attempt at a film. There are so many better ones to see that this is a total waste of time to make and even worse to watch. Nice cast that were very overpaid for what is supposed to be acting. This must have been a contractual obligation.",
    "14": "I really wanted to like this movie. It has such a great cast and I had such high hopes. As soon as I got about 20 minutes in I knew the movie was trash. A star studded cast with zero depth to any of their conversations. I saw that the Obamas produced it. I guess they talked their celebrity friends into acting in it? It's the only thing that makes sense because I cannot imagine wanting my name attached to this movie in any way. There is no explaination as to what's going on. Events that make zero sense and will not be explained continue to happen. The acting is subpar at best. It's really a shame. What is even more a shame is the positive reviews. My guess is Sam is drumming up all his friends and family writing positive reviews. Emmy stop! It's one review per person.",
    "15": "Typical US self-obsessed nonsense. Terrible performances and worse direction. Truly awful writing.I read a review claiming the book to be pretentious but, no, not this movie, essentially subreddit garbage \"philosophy\" put to film. The characters were unlikable and shallow and written to display \"depth\" through forced complexity that really just made them all inconsistent. The performances ranged from former A-listers phoning in impressions of themselves to newcomers pushing too hard. The dialogue was self-consciously \"cool\" and so unnatural it was distracting.Ever go to a nice restaurant only to have it spoiled by a trendy hipster who's opinion that macaroni and cheese should use Guyere over Sharp Cheddar feels inauthentic and scripted off an Internet forum? It's like that.",
    "16": "I love disaster and end of the world movies. I thought I would love this. But then the cast is terrible, either obnoxious or plain stupid. Everybody says and does the wrong thing, every time. Of course race baiting. More and more race baiting. No American production without race baiting. And what exactly is the plot here? Everyone speaks.so.slowly. No one has any credible emotions. It's so dull. It's so tedious. After one hour I felt nothing for the movie or the people. I could not care less. Environment? Terrorism? Or it's the race thing, again? I'm sorry for anyone who started watching this. For the rest of you - don't.",
    "17": "This film was a disturbing look at the world under cyberattack and the response of the Sandford family, Amanda and Clay along with their two children, Archie and young Rose.The Sandfords interact with G. H. Scott and his daughter Ruth. Thrown together in a house, the group struggles to come to grips with the reality of their predicament. They are also forced to probe their inner attitudes towards humanity, and the picture is not a pretty one.There was an attempt at a \"Lord of the Flies\" analysis of human nature. The diabolical attack was designed to bring out the worst in people, who would self-dispossess themselves of any sense of altruism and concern for one another.Despite the good performances and solid production values, the message of the film was bleak and unforgiving. The occasional moments of dark comedy that crept into the film were not enough to compensate for the wasteland that the characters have created for themselves.In a world shorn of technological perks, the humans have lost the one trait that could have been their salvation: compassion.",
    "18": "I've watched some awful movies in my lifetime, but this crappy, stupid was a total waste...I want my time back!! And I had a hard time just believing that Julia Roberts would actually participate in a film that was this terrible! First, the camera angles must have been done by someone with the DTs, totally gave me a headache just looking at them...second, the music score had to be the worst I've ever heard in ANY movie...must have been done by a juvenile music student...another headache!... I actually thought the premise of the world being attacked & people having to cope without phones,internet & other necessities would make a great movie....boy, was I WRONG! And the WORST part was the abrupt ending...no explanation, no follow-up, no NOTHING! Just stopped! Don't do what I did....save yourself the misery & time...THIS MOVIE SHOULD DEFINITELY GET AN AWARD FOR WORST EVER MADE! If this is the best NETFLIX can do, I'm seriously thinking of canceling!",
    "19": "All the visual ambition of Blumhouse, with the writing flair of Shyamalan.A real slog to get through with very little payoff.I you've read this far, you know the premise and should probably save your time. Robert and Hawke are as wooden as they've ever been, Ali's pretty good, but not enough to save this and Bacon does a good 5 minutes and I hope he enjoyed his money.However, the directing, clumsy camerawork and terrible visual style are really what lets this down. Directed by Same Esmail of... some episode of Mr. Robot \"fame\" a series lauded for... oh, hang on - I liked Mr. Robot well enough, but directing wasn't the strong point there either.There's some really bad visual touches, cutting from something (I forget) to a glass of water at an angle... to make you tilt your head - maybe. It's probably supposed to make you feel disoriented, but Esmail way as well be in the background of this shot waving his arms, shouting \"hey, it's an analogy\". There's some shot of the moon, satellites and other tech stuff that are just left hanging, I'm guessing they were meant to be ominous. Deer run, then stand still, flamingos land in the pool and for some reason Friends gets referenced. In a touching tribute to Matthew Perry from Friends there's a massive car wreck that could be seen coming from miles away - maybe that's the \"clever\" metaphor - we could have stopped this is we wanted, it was just better to watch it crash and burn. It's a shame Neetflix didn't realise this and just set fire to some money instead of whatever this film was supposed to be.A stupid film for stupid people.",
    "20": "This is a film about a 13-year-old girl who has been watching the TV series \"Friends,\" but just before she watched the series finale, a cyber-attack war begins and her internet is knocked out. Fortunately for her, she is staying in a luxury vacation rental that has electricity. The girl, her big brother, their parents, spend the rest of the film wandering around aimlessly with the man who owns the vacation house and his daughter. The mood is like one of M. Night Shyamalan's bad movies (not \"Sixth Sense). It can't decide whether it's a war movie about an attack on our tech infrastructure or a supernatural movie. It's too boring. The dialogue is unrealistic and Julia Roberts struggles with it because it's so awkward. Kevin Bacon is good, but he only speaks in one scene. The whole thing seems like a giant missed opportunity for what could have been a good story.",
    "21": "What's with the bad reviews and scattered ratings of 1? Absolutely ridiculous and I can only imagine those are coming from a certain section of the American public who won't tolerate a critique of America or the involvement of the Obamas in the productionof the film.This is a good film. Full stop. Maybe not outstanding but certainly not deserving of the vitriol of some reviews here. The acting is top notch, as is the direction. The tension builds from the get go as neither the characters or viewers know what's happening, how to get information, or who to trust.I didn't feel a need to know exactly who was behind the attack to appreciate the film or the ending. I got it & I'm surprised others didn't.It's a shame society is so polarised & people so hateful that good films are negatively rated because of politics. Maybe someone can make a film about where this sort of thing takes us.",
    "22": "The best movie of the year. You have to want to understand the movie. It's not about a specific event, it's about what drives people and what we perceive as our reality and how thin the line is that our civilization is built on. It's about how we tend to lie to ourselves and how we try to forget that the line between us and chaos is not very wide. We take everything for granted, that our smartphones and computers work, that the lights come on when we flip the switch, and that clean water comes out of the tap. We take it for granted that everything runs in an orderly fashion and can hardly imagine that it could be any different. This movie shows that it is not a matter of course... The movie is extremely intelligent and exciting. Despite its excessive length, I didn't get bored. It's very rare for a movie to captivate me like this.",
    "23": "The first 75% of the movie was fantastic, it did a great job of building suspense and the acting was top notch. The ending tried to wrap up the movie way too fast and left a lot of unanswered questions that alluded to a number of suspenseful/sci-fi plot points that never came to fruition.In the end, the entire plot was that the US was under attack by one, or potentially several hostile threats/countries, but that is never clarified. Ok, but what about the random plot points that went no where?Cyber attack, sure that makes sense. Auto pilot cars that intentionally clog up major motor ways, that makes sense. Navigation systems disrupting freight ships and airplanes, that makes sense. But it falls apart from there.The noise was part of the attack but we never find out what exactly it was, what was generating it, what the extent of the damage it was causing, but let's not get into that aside from it's most likely just part of a shock and awe campaign.The deer and flamingos congregating on the property is just simply explained as \"The animals know something we don't\" but let's just leave it at that and not go into any more detail or explain any of it.There's a random shed that looks at the house, and there's a bed of leaves with a body indentation where someone has been sleeping. Super creepy, is this another character that has been stalking the families? Nope, it's never explained and doesn't factor into the plot at all.The son gets bit by an insect and his teeth start falling out the next day. Is there a plague that will wipe out civilization? Nope, they just get some random pills from a handyman and that's the end of that plot line.Is mom dead? Probably, but let's not get into that, instead let's just have a super awkward scene where a drunk husband and wife come close to cheating on their spouses.There's a shot of the US flag on the moon with the earth in the background, is there an alien invasion? Nope, we just threw that scene in there because why not? It might loosely represent that the US is under attack but otherwise we just really wanted this scene in the movie for no reason.So much wasted potential. Seems like a typical Netflix movie that blew its budget on the actors and a few CGI scenes and then tried to close everything out as quickly and cheaply as possible.",
    "24": "An all-star team (Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Kevin Bacon) lead a psychological thriller with political underpinnings.What a reason to turn on a film and watch.The set up is interesting: a tech hit, a conspiracy theory that points to a coup d'etat, faint hints of big players in economics moving money in anticipation of resulting civil disruptions.Along the way we also examine how people no longer really have faith in other people, the disconnect between generations, and examples of inherent racism even in people who present themselves as \"nice.\"What may sound like too much of a narrative \"pile on\" is layered so carefully that it's like the jenga tower the family builds at one point in the middle.Kudos to the entire cast for keeping viewers involved and maintaining the suspension of disbelief this whole story requires.---The tension becomes so thick that you almost need to escape just like the characters.Young daughter Rose (Farrah Mackenzie) hit a chord with me as the kid trying to distract herself with popular television. Like so many fans on social media, trying to find a small ounce of happiness as real life disasters abound.(How many \"once in a century\" disasters can one generation withstand, after all?)And like so many, she fixates to get through the day in this mess of a world.---The framing of shots and editing were magnificent.The music became a character unto itself. (Though sometimes it was heavy--but by making that choice the director almost implanted the tension in viewers' minds.)To me the only short coming was that after all that rise in action, we really stopped short.(edited to add)\nAnd yet--after some thought--perhaps that was the point: to leave audiences with a cliffhanger of what would (are) we do in a catastrophe?Are we like Rose, holed up in a silo perhaps safe (perhaps just oblivious)?Are we the parents who may or may not end up in there with her?Maybe seeing the warnings on the electronics and reaching out to try to form some sort of informational network among those able to receive?What exactly should be the response to internal collapse and division? Can we find a moral way through that thicket?It's both a horrible ending and yet brilliant in that it won't leave my mind for a while.",
    "25": "This is what happens when a lot of expectations are slammed by a crappy lengthy flick. This basically has nothing to bring on table. Soo many unnecessary and far fetched scenes with no conclusion or connection with the next one. The makers tried to buiild the suspence in the beginning but then gave up later and decided to change the course. Quick tip...Fast forward the long conversation scenes. Glad that I learnt it in the first hour. You would expect something at the end of those stretched scenes but nothing would happen. Left soo many questions unanswered. For a movie based on catastrophic events, the ending was hilarious !",
    "26": "Movie was rated 6.8/10 so one would think it must get better, I watched to over half way before fast forwarding through the last hour and glad I did, could see it didn't get any better. I don't understand why humans could have any effect on what the wildlife would do. Things would happen to some types of transport that would not affect other types.Then there was a scene between two characters that had a language barrier, what was the point of that with no subtitles.With a star cast i was expecting a good storyline, a good end of the world movie that did not eventuate.The pace was extremely slow and if you don't like slow movies then skip this one.",
    "27": "An excellent film. I haven't seen a movie this well done in a long time. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat from the start to its climax .The story line was riveting, and the message was all true on so many fronts today. The acting was excellent and made the movie all the more believable. The movie was both frightful and mind-bending, and it touched all of the emotions. The layout was a 10, and the characters were interesting and true to nature.. It's been a long time since I have seen a film this good, and frankly, despite the genre this movie has to be in the running for a host of awards across the board. I truly recommend this film to every person in America who loves movies. This movie will be on my blur-ray list when it becomes available. I truly loved this film.",
    "28": "Would have made a better series. Some great parts in this film and it has a great cast of actors that somehow keep you watching until the end. However it is very disjointed and just ends without any sort of explanation. Branches of in all sorts of different directions, mini stories shared but not finished. Left with a lot of questions it's like they ended it half an hour too soon. Kevin Bacon has a bit part they could have done more with his character. If you have a couple of hours to kill give it a watch however prepare for the dissatisfaction it leaves you with when the credits roll! 6/10 from me and that's mainly down to the actors.",
    "29": "This movie could be best described as if every actor was cast for a different movie and everyone was filmed apart then spliced together in editing. If that is true, its exceptionally well done. If not then the director clearly didn't care about making a good movie.Everything is out of sync. The dialog just doesn't work. The characters are weak. The sound/audio is cringe. The special effects are ok but don't actually matter in any way. The acting is good?... like how good you are at your job on Monday after a weekend of binge drinking... sure... work got done, but your best work...?The ending... you might as well watch Friends instead of this movie.",
    "30": "I will admit, I was hooked and I was invested to see the final outcome as well as getting answers to the many questions I had while watching, however, only a couple questions were ever answered and that ending had me wanting to smash my skull into the concrete outside for wasting 2+ hours of my time on this travesty.What was with the animal interactions with the humans, specifically the deer? It made zero sense.What was with the use of the color blue? Blue rooms, blue clothing, blue car, blue hue, extremely blue drinking water. So much blue I though there was something wrong with my TV.Why did one person get radiation sickness and nobody else did? Was it due to the bug bite? The sound or what?What was the reasoning of showing the trashed American flag on the moon? It looked like someone stomped on it in mud and then put it back up.I guess I am expecting too much when it comes to a movie having explanations for most things and leaving ambiguity where it makes sense.If you have nothing to do on a snowy Sunday afternoon then I would suggest this garbage to kill some time, other than that, give this hot mess a serious pass.",
    "31": "A middle class couple leave NYC with their two teenage kids to stay in a luxurious Long Island beach house for a weekend getaway. Phone, TV and internet service stop functioning shortly after their arrival, and later that night the home's affluent African-American owner and his college-age daughter arrive seeking refuge from societal disintegration in Manhattan. A prickly introduction ensues before the two ill-matched families fall asleep uneasily under the same roof.Morning brings a truce, but no illumination about the nature of the crisis - only rumors that the mayhem might be caused by hostile foreigners or native extremists. The vacationers stay on as numerous disturbing incidents demonstrate all is not well with the world - oil tankers grounding themselves on beaches, crashing airliners, wrecked cars blocking the highways, animals behaving strangely, loud noises and the teenage son falling ill.Neither story nor characters have much of an arc, but the cast manages to keep the project afloat until all the unexplained events start stretching credulity beyond breaking point. The various disasters have little rationality behind them, and the absence of other human beings within sight of the city seems especially improbable. Once belief has been lost, the movie shows how an apocalyptic suspenseful mystery can turn into a bit of a bore. The film wraps up with a deeply unsatisfying conclusion comprising a formulaic confrontation and a final speculation about the ongoing catastrophe.",
    "32": "Leave the World Behind is a prime example of a hollow, meaningless modernist movie that's all flair and gestures. All style and no subdtance as the old cliche goes. However, I cant even give this movie that. Sure its director thinks he has style with all the overhead shots and screwing movements but this is the most unmotivated, obnoxious type of filmmaking you'll find just about anywhere. Which the same can be said about the plot or shall we just say, what happens. It expects to intrigue you with this enigmatic mystery but all it is is a constant procession of bizarre events and most dont even make any sense. The film is the product of creativeless, stale minds that know nothing and believe in nothing. Somewhere mixed in all this is a message about misanthropy, well after watching this I hate them too; certainly those who make this sort of junk.",
    "33": "It was a great start. Felt like it was going to be good. Then it quickly turned into a disaster. To many plot holes and o included a lack of true awareness by any of the characters. They seem inept to how people would actually react to events like this. The character of the owners daughter is obnoxious and pretentious. To the point you dread her character every time she comes on screen. For example at one point she claims the father of the renters family \"wants her\" and in no way does that ever get implied. Further more the amount of trash filler and odd turns the characters take like Roberts character suddenly being attracted to The Owner after saying in the same scene that she just got over hating him... now suddenly wants to screw him and has to remind herself she is married. Its ridiculous. Its just things like this sprinkled throughout the movie that just make it an insufferable movie to sit through. So inconsistent and so much preachy vibes.",
    "34": "I have only this to say to the writers, producers, directors, and the cast of this movie..... I will never get those two hours back. That was two hours of my life that were completely wasted. I may have seen a worse movie in my life, but I don't know what it was or when I saw it.I suppose the strategy was to put some big names in a movie and show a few action scenes in the trailer.......ok, we'll make some money!!!The storyline keeps wanting to unfold...we keep believing that we will soon know what is going on.....and that, maybe, the characters will understand what is happening, and maybe they will be able to react to it in some way. Don't hold your breath. As the ending credits roll, you are still in the dark. Trust me....or don't....if you watch this, you'll agree.",
    "35": "I get so annoyed by movies where the entire premise requires people to repeatedly do things that normal people wouldn't do. They ignore things normal people wouldn't ignore. And they don't react pretty much ever the way normal people would act. Hours pass and they don't discuss things that they should be talking about. I can give that a pass here or there in a movie, but when the entire story has that happen over and over to move forward it just gets silly.While most of the main characters move along in happy ignorance the background music cranks the creepy up to 11 for us.What you do get a lot of is people talking in hushed voices, while vary rarely actually saying anything important.",
    "36": "After just a few minutes, we (wife and I) were pulled into the suspense and drama of this movie. For over two hours we followed the tense, taut events with several 'whoa!!' moments.And then it just ended. With all the effort in building up the complex, intriguing plot, I can see how a definitive ending would be difficult or impossible to create. It felt like rather than make any attempt, they just chose an abrupt, inexplicable stopping point versus an actual ending. Many plot elements were developed and left hanging.The first two hours I'd rate this an 8 or a 9. The last 10 minutes a 2 at most.",
    "37": "Started out great. 1 hour and 39 min in, it's still building towards what? A slow burn going nowhere. Extremely poor acting. Poor script at times. Not realistic at all.

I want my time back!Required characters 600? More wasted time spent on this film?! No way. Started out great. 1 hour and 39 min in, it's still building towards what? A slow burn going nowhere.

    "38": "Started watching this Netflix original film because of the excellent cast in it. Main actors include Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, and Ethan Hawke all do well in their roles but it is the child actress Farrah Mackenzie that makes the most impactIt is a slow-burn end of the world movie. It starts well where they slowly build-up the suspense and keep you guessing as to what could be happening. No concrete info is provided other than what the characters are saying to each other.But after watching this for more than two hours you expect some answers ...but you don't get any. Makes you wonder why did I waste 2 hours of my life?.",
    "39": "That's the essence of this film. A disaster movie tga is in itself a disaster. Nothing but dead ends in every direction, as if they kept switching writers and leaving plot lines unfinished. Honestly, the cast draws you in, but it is a trap. They are the shiny objects, to get your attention, while the movie is nothing but a pit of sewage. Bottom line, this mess is not worth your time. To call it a train wreck would be high praise. It is the product of some preachy buffoons who had no idea how to properly write a story. For those claiming this is a \"thinking\" movie, get real. The only thinking you'll be doing is asking yourself why you're wasting time watching this garbage.",
    "40": "I don't usually leave reviews, but this movie was so bad I couldn't help it. Julia Roberts has been one of my favourite actors off all time. I'm not sure if she read the script before agreeing to the movie.I have watched slow burner movies before, this one didn't catch fire. It is possibly the worst thriller I have ever seen. How it got as high a rating as it has is beyond comprehension.The shining light in the movie was the daughter who I believe is an exceptional young actress. However, she could not help a movie this bad. If you watch it and expect something to happen, don't hold your breath.",
    "41": "How on earth has it come to this???? The movie industry and its ability create drama has gone the same way as the music industry. Down the toilet. I actually pity this generation that they are being pushed a diet of such mediocrity and even worse they believe what they are seeing or hearing is talent. This is the first new film I've watched in ages it caught my eye I only ever watch movies from the 1940s-90s otherwise. On the whole human ability to create and be original without technology ended with the passing of last century. This film adequately makes my point for me. The best in film is now Asian, parasite showing what is still possible. As for western cinema like its music, the RIP - as the once fantastic oscars now themselves betray - is well and truly a permanent one. Goodbye Hollywood it's been fun!",
    "42": "Lots of unanswered questions & events. The writer said that ending it with no clear answers or explanations would be \"respecting the viewer\". Let's call it what it is... writers block at best; lazy, unimaginative storytelling at worst. It all means the same thing... Very unsatisfying after sitting there for nearly 2 1/2 hours.Also, factor in that there are no sympathetic characters. No characters that you genuinely care for because they are all pretty unlikable. It seems that he has mistaken mystery and unexplainable events with good character creation and story arcing. If it helps, imagine the way you felt if you watched the last episode of Lost after watching the entire series. Watch it your own risk.",
    "43": "With some really good shows under his belt like \"Mr. Robot\" and \"Home Coming\", I expected more from Sam Esmail. In addition, the casting suggested we could expect better.The movie definitely has some of Sam's classic \"time-release\" style. Hinting at things slowly, leaving the viewers guessing and hanging on in anticipation of learning the truth. Waiting for the secrets to be revealed. SPOILER - YOU NEVER REALLY DO.There are many topically and psychologically complex avenues that he seems to start down and then quickly veers off in another direction. The movie tries to make a point yet fails to deliver.This failure is in spite of the very talented cast. The movie plunges forward aimlessly, much like the self driving cars in the movie.While I may only speculate on the root cause, I can recommend - do not waste your time. The ending will leave you feeling very dissatisfied.",
    "44": "If you think this movie will improve as time ticks by, you will be disappointed. It continued to reveal fictitious character behaviors that would never be witnessed in reality. I felt like I was watching a spoof of 'What Not To Do' when strangers show up to your Airbnb in the middle of the night trying to force their way inside. While the cast was great, and it had a high production value, it just wasn't believable. I had no empathy for the characters, not even the children. They did nothing to support that connection early on in the film. I couldn't even make it to the end, it was simply too painful to watch; I found myself wishing they would just end it and kill the entire cast.",
    "45": "The WORST! The dialogue is so dumb it's not even funny. Just dumb.Sam Esmail and Rumaan Alam have contrived a movie so bad Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, and Ethan Hawke can't save it. Annoying camera angles to distract the viewer from the fact that this movie is STUPID.The exposition is painful. An absolutely terrible script.A full day into the supposed hackers disrupting the world, Mahershala Ali wanders to a neighbor's house, finds it abandoned, and then wanders along the beach where he spots a watch buried in the sand. How? Not sure, he bands down to pick it up and yep, it's attached to an arm. Oh no! He falls to the ground, then realized the entire area is littered with bodies from a plane crash. Gee, he saw the watch mostly buried in the sand, but missed all the dead bodies he walked through to see it. Then a 2nd plane crashes - this is several blocks from where everyone is staying but Julia Roberts, Myha'la etc. Don't hear a sound... One of the more memorably STUPID scenes.This movie is dumber than a box of rocks... TOO STUPID to be believed.",
    "46": "Sure this isnt the way theyre going to end it. What happened? Why are the animals going crazy? Hello!! It started as promising and a very different film, but clearly the writers had nowhere to go with an ending, so they didn't give one. You have to just use your own imagination here! Very disappointing to have wasted over 2 hours watching this, which was way too long for the content. Julia Roberts character was awful, her kids super annoying, daughter was a borderline sociopath. The whole family's lingering cognitive dissonance despite the mounting, obvious evidence of what was happening drove me to near insanity. The only reason I and probably a lot of other people watch this film is because Julia Roberts is in it.",
    "47": "Horror films have always taken societal fears of the era and used them to create our monsters. Atomic bombs in the 50s gave us Godzilla, Richard Speck and Charles Manson gave us Halloween, and today's national infighting has now given us Leave the World Behind.President Obama's minimal involvement in its creation is likely behind the negative reviews, because this story is an excellent, horrifying film. (This is unfortunate, because it hits too close to reality for comfort) . Tension builds from the start. The storyline is strong. Great acting by all involved. Kudos especially to Roberts, Myha'la and Mackenzie for bringing dynamic emotional depth to their characters. All of the actors' performances ring true.Leave the World Behind is the type of movie that will generate deep discussions and may cause you some sleepless nights.",
    "48": "It's freaking brilliant. If you get it, you get it. If you don't, you'll be annoyed at the end.I was engaged 100%, didn't scroll my phone.I didn't pause it.Great performances.Chilling throughout.Dramatic.Quirky beyond belief.And so poignant within the realm of our current society it made me shout out at just how wonderfully wrong and right the ending is.Watch it. Have a glass of wine. Keep watching.Then sit back and laugh.Totally worth it by a mile and a New York minute,\nLike the Wizard of Oz, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Jurassic Park, and Escape from LA all rolled into one big ball of WTF. Okay, not really. But it's good.",
    "49": "Where do I start?! The characters as well as the dialogue were so poorly written. It's just unbelievable. With this kind of cast I expected so much more! Also there is no explanation whatsoever of why some things are happening! Like, I get what they want to show with this movie overall, but it just leaves you hanging regarding smaller issues. And don't get me started on the ending. Just completely frustrating!!!After reading some of the other comments I am seriously wondering if we've been watching a different movie. This was a complete waste of our time! Do NOT recommend watching this movie!",
    "50": "Just want to start by saying I generally love apocalyptic movies.However...\nWhen you make an apocalyptic movie you need to make at least one likable character. Half way in I couldn't care less if all of them vanished. You have Julia Robert's (a generally likable actress in most films) angry, complaining about everything , being the definitive 'Karen' for most of the movie, Ethan Hawk who acts like the biggest (another word for cat) the entire movie, their 2 kids one stupider then the other, Myha'la Jael Herrold the stereotypical affluent young black PC girl who blames everything on the white people, Kevin Bacon who is in it for a minute (wasted talent)playing a stereotypical right wing prepper, and the only remotely likable character played by Ali.This movie played into every stereotype ad nauseum! No character had common sense.So with all that you get a long movie that has no real backstory and no real plausible story in general. Things happen and you can guess what is occurring but the characters make the dumbest decisions to the point you're thinking 'what is wrong with these people?\".Then the daughter with this whole obsession with the show Friends! Really!? She's old enough to know that the world may end yet her main focus is catching the last episode of Friends?You've failed as a parent if that is the only thing your teen kid cares about (this theme runs throughout the movie). I'm sure there was a deeper meaning to the Friends theme, they just forgot to tell the audience.This is a stellar cast so I would expect something more.. maybe this is a product of 'Too many cooks spoil the soup' ... look at how many high profile people produced this.Maybe it would've made a better mini series so each person could put their ideas in a separate take.Missed opportunity big time!",
    "51": "The first shots of the New York silhouette during dawn was beautiful. That gave me hope despite the single clingkity-clop piano music which made be think that this was either a sci-fi or a end of the world zombie/plague/virus -type of movie. Unfortunately the first impression didn't last. The director tries too hard with revolving camera angles, etc, simple shots that should be shot simple. My hopes were shattered when a crowd on the beach actually flee from an oil tanker... Yes, an oil tanker. Not a truck, or a airplane, but an oil tanker... If awards were given to slow reactions...And then the big (first... second?) twist with the original owners knocking on the door in the middle of the night and even though it's top of the line actors (Roberts, Hawke, Ali, Bacon) the poor dialogues combined with the poor choice of \"mysterious\" piano/violin music makes it a cringe fest that never stops. It feels like a cliche of all disaster movies combined into one.",
    "52": "This had a whole lot of nothing in this movie. The lead up in the trailer made it seem like a lot would happen. It was like watching a suspense to lead up to something amazing but this falls short in a huge way. The final scene was such a let down, it really was so boring that I fell asleep so many times. The music choice for this was extremely weird from the start and the characters did not fit together. I found the actors awkward and just oddly cast together. For some reason they had Julia Roberts say the F word about 100 times in this movie, it was the only curse word anyone actually used at all. If you want a thriller, this movie isn't it. Nothing really happens and it's dull from start to end.",
    "53": "I watched this film as a preview screening and was absolutely bored out of my skull. It's completely unrealistic that an apocalypse of sorts would be happening and you've got a 'guess who's coming to dinner' situation going on. I saw the film last night at the AFI premiere hoping it was better. It was not. I can't blame it if the book is just as bad but it just doesn't have its priorities in order. You wouldn't be arguing about race when the world is falling apart. The movie doesn't make any sense, there's no pay off. It's basically a waste of a really good cast. I don't even recommend watching when it comes out on Netflix.",
    "54": "\"Leave the World Behind\" garnered significant attention in 2023, particularly for being recognized as the year's best film by The Wrap. However, after viewing this film, I must vehemently disagree with this accolade.The film attempts to present a sort of fear-mongering narrative, where a single cyberattack cripples the entire infrastructure of the United States, including satellites, atomic weapon security systems, airplanes, and large cargo ships. This concept is not only exaggerated but ridiculously unrealistic.What the film lacks is a coherent story. The plot feels unfinished, with characters who have no depth. The film seems more intent on serving as a warning about what could happen amidst tense international relations, but it does so in such an unbelievable and theatrical manner that it completely misses its mark.The length of the movie, 2 hours and 20 minutes, felt like an endless quest for logical answers, which, unfortunately, never came. The plot holes were numerous and laughable, such as a ship crashing onto a beach because the GPS fails, as if there would be no crew on board to steer the ship.Instead of delivering a powerful message or an engaging story, \"Leave the World Behind\" offers nothing more than a series of confusing and unrealistic scenarios. It's a shame that a film with such potential is reduced to nothing more than a cheap scare story.Feel free to further modify this review to match your style or to add any additional points you find important.",
    "55": "The next door girl with The Smile. Ever since her rise to fame in Pretty Woman, Roberts is known for 1 thing, her smile, giggles and laughter. This movie has almost none of those. And that means Leave the World Behind has low attraction for Roberts fans.Don't get me wrong, the story is very interesting and packs a lot of surprises. However, at this time, this film is nothing but a very preachy film about how humans destroy everything emotional decisions and greed.This movie tried to pack in too many things into 1 single film, though it is well packaged. Watching it felt like sitting for Al Gore's earth ending presentation. It's nothing but snore fest for me because it is a illogical take on humanity, preaching on racism and preaching on sadness without anything to support the why.",
    "56": "I only finished watching this to see how they would tie up all of the loose ends, but all you get is a meme-level pointless cliffhanger ending that's not even funny. This movie was an utter mess that draws you in on an interesting premise, tortures you with lazy sound design tropes, unnecessary tension-building cliches, and multiple plot devices which turn into storyline dead ends. Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Kevin Bacon and Ethan Hawke are veteran actors who are way better than this and it's weird to see them debase themselves on such an amateurish production that is thinly-veiled activism. Avoid.",
    "57": "This was so slow.... I think the first red flag was there was way too many big name actors for the movie to be good. Did I mention it is really slow.The script is really bad. Especially once the second coupl comes into the movie. It's apparent that the director is as trying to make some point. But really just made a scene painfully long. The surprise wife or daughter or whatever she was....was extremely annoying and seemed to lack acting depth in the room full of high caliber actors.When movies are this bad, I usually come here to see what the score is and how many people voted. Yea, at 6.6 , I figured this movie is really bad. Then I saw the producers are the main actors and former president Obama. This just seemed like an agenda or revival of actors careers that have died for me to endure more. Below is supposedly what the movies about. Spoiler if you read moreLeave the World Behind is a nightmarish cautionary tale about our reliance on technology; it's also a timely story about the historical fissures in modern American society that threaten to see the nation implode. Racism. Class inequality.",

Hordes of deer standing around staring. \"The animals are trying to tell us something.\"Really?Ho*ny teenage boy bitten in the woods and his teeth fall out.You don't say...Of course, it's not known to the viewing audience WHAT bit him. Then we must suffer through a smart-aleck former college student (Myha'la) who is worried about her mom (whom you never see or get any updates) and keeps her arms folded and gets a kick out of being, well...a-holish...Then, we try to figure out the weird wife (Julia) who hates people (so what) and treats her husband as if he's her child...Then, there's the equally weird husband (E. Hawke) who is a wuss.And, OMG...the short-bus \"Friends\" obsessed daughter (F. Mackenzie) who you just want to shake...Oh, and Mr. Money Bags (M. Ali) who's character is a like watching paint dry...And of course, Mr. Bunker Man (K. Bacon) who has two scenes in the entire movie. Kevin must have needed a few extra dollars.All in all, it's a TERRIBLE MOVIE!And the ending? OMG! We're subjected to watching that slow child sitting at a table inside of a house (that she broke into) eating chips like it's her last meal, drinking water out of a jug, and just sitting there looking stupid, apparently unaware that her skitzing mother (Roberts) and Smart-Aleck is running around in the woods searching for her.THEN, WE COME TO THE GREATEST INSULT OF ALL, \"Short Bus\" finds an underground bunker in the house (after she done stuffing her face) and GET THIS.... she finds a DVD of the sitcom, \"FRIENDS\"!!! WOOHOO!!!So, she pops in the DVD and sits down to watch the last episode that she was so OBSESSED with seeing THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE... and the camera ZOOMS in on her freckled face and she......grins.THE ENDSeriously?AGAIN, THIS MOVIE IS TERRIBLE!",
    "59": "This Obama-funded attempt at enviro propaganda is a dud (yes Barack and Michelle are the executive producers). Paired with an uninspired performance by Roberts, Hawke, Bacon, and the entire cast, it lacks in so many ways. Some of the scenes' effects are decently well done. However, while it's always fun to see Teslas crashing into each other, and oil tankers driving up on the beach, unfortunately the storyline suffers from the political agenda too much to make it a movie worth making. Ultimately, recommend you skip it. Like most of Netflix's in-house movies, not great...not even worth your time.",
    "60": "\"Leave the World Behind,\" Netflix's latest holiday offering, is Judgment Day in four acts, where tenacity and verve, escape and reflection are in short order, as much as survival of the fittest, or just a house fitted for survival: surplus canned goods, WiFi, and all ten seasons of \"Friends.\"From a wild wag of an oculist, a novel, apparently, and the recesses of Sam Esmail's deep, dark unconscious comes a tale of privilege and discontent in, what appears to be, Gatsby territory on Long Island's Gold Coast. Having a \"hellish year,\" the entitled and White Sanfords, played by long-in-the-tooth Julia Roberts (no pun intended) and preternaturally rumpled Ethan Hawk, decamp their cozy Park Slope brownstone to the cliché hamlet, Point Comfort, which, to those following this, is all-too-obvious foreshadowing, like \"The Last One\" episode of \"Friends\" (even the blind will see that one coming).Now that she has entered the horror stage of an aging actor's career, Roberts delivers her best deadpan looks, smiling less and less, and slips easily into the one-dimensional role, yet again in an Esmail endeavor. But the work isn't challenging and it pays well.Also White in the cast, Kevin Bacon makes a guest appearance as a cap-wearing, gun-toting survivalist, in a scene that serves no purpose other than providing him a job.Representing Black privilege and entitlement, despite being relegated to the basement apartment, Mahershala Ali plays G. H. Scott, the putout homeowner, who shows up unexpectedly with his snippy daughter (Myha'la), playing his cards close the vest, delivering a nicely layered performance before succumbing to the banal. All the other performers arrive there much sooner.Perhaps there's a message to be learned from this tackling of race concerns in a doomsday plot, but whatever that might be is as vague and convoluted as the plot itself. Strange things are happening: deer and flamingos are herding, planes and leaflets are falling, the Internet and driverless cars are crashing, and a cultured, intelligent, and wealthy Black man is delicately defending his right to seek refuge in his own home. Yet, after two hours and eighteen minutes of mayhem, the Sanfords and the Scotts finally join alliances for some contrived and futile purpose, much like that of this movie.",
    "61": "It seems as if a lot of people were disappointed by this movie. For some reason it hasn't been officially labeled as science fiction but I would put it squarely in the category of science fiction that is thought-provoking and has points to make - which can mean, frustratingly, that it's meant to operate on a metaphorical level as against being intended to be taken literally - I put the brilliant \"Severance\" in this category too. In addition to being thought-provoking, it is, fortunately, also quite riveting, eerie, and exceptionally well-cast and well-acted. I wanted to single out Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali, but it would be unfair to leave out the rest of the cast. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER - As far as messages, the obvious one is over-dependency on tech; but the overarching theme is that we don't need aliens to destroy us, it is easy to get us to tear ourselves apart from within; all the seeds are there. It therefore has an all-too-relevant contemporary political message, yet its implications about current politics are indirect, not ham-fisted. I will also mention that once I perceived this message I thought of an episode of the original Twilight Zone that had a similar theme, starring Claude Akins, in which disguised aliens from another planet work up residents of a small town into more or less lynching each other. Anyway, back to Leave the World Behind - some viewers have indicated disapproval of SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER its lack of specific information as to who has launched the attack, how the various individuals fare in the end, etc. But IMO it ends where it needs to - the points have been made, and the viewer can imagine his or her own scenarios.",

Worst movie IMHO. What happened to passive dad? I saw a glimpse of Julia briefly when she was dancing. The rest of her was someone I didn't like or recognize. And what's with the ship landing on the beach?All in all. One of the worst movies I've watched. Again, Movies are my thing.Ethan Hawke. Was so great in other movies. Not so much anymore. Same for Julia Roberts. Straight to Netflix for this days something, and nothing good.",
    "63": "Absolute huge waste of time. The script sounds good in a paragraph but the overall attitude and feeling was lacking, in other words it was quite boring. Plus there were too many plot holes it's cringy. I would have expected more from Mr. Ethan Hawke (He's my favorite actor) but it wasn't the actors fault. None of them. The directors and producers just have no talent. And truly this had great potential, the story is interesting but they just couldn't embody it enough to pull it off. It doesn't even fit in the basic low rated movie list. No wonder Mr. Denzel Washington dropped out of it. Netflix should be more choosey on what they offer.",

This movie had potential to actually be something special. What a let down. The pacing of the movie was top notch, it didn't feel like 2 hours and 20 minutes. It does very well at keeping you engaged and wondering what's happening the whole time. But once you find out (kind of) what's actually happening, again, A COMPLETE let down of an ending. I wouldn't go as far to say I wouldn't recommend this movie, but keep your expectations in check while your watching. It leads you down the beautiful rainbow in hopes of a pot of gold but all you find is spoiled lucky charms.",
    "65": "I was really excited about seeing this movie especially with the actors involved and of course Mr. Robot is a fantastic series so the Director obviously knows what he's doingThis is not the type of movie that most people are going to enjoy because it's a social commentary about what makes people tick and what separates us especially during a calamity or Armageddon situation. It's not about the attackers so beware that is not the focus of this story.The writer Director leaves tons of plot holes just to make the viewer question what is really going on\nyet that's not the real focus of the film as it's mostly about the characters and what brings them together or separates them - much like what's going on in contemporary society. It's a unique point of view and perspective but falls short of being clever.However, after a while, this is so obvious that One wonders if there's any more depth to the story, and it feels more like a TV pilot that could've gone so much deeper, but instead ends with this silly notion of the child, watching the friends series last episode in the bunker and you realize - it's all About the illusion of being there for each other or not being there.For most viewers this movie is going to be super annoying because not much is explained and so many bizarre things happen without any explanation except that they wanna make you think rather try to explain anything because it doesn't really even make sense to the writer director either. It's just a farce that allows one to self examine us humans.Maybe that's the whole point is to put the viewer in a place where imagine if the entire grid went out and some foreign entity decides to invade, but they leave it open so broad with shots of even the moon with the flag as if maybe, it's even aliens that's how far-fetched it gets But also quite pathetic if that's the only message that keeps on getting repeated over and over and overThe acting is superb. The CGI is pretty darn good, but it could've been so much better so it's only a 5 stars for cheating the audience with so many loop holes.Like why are the deer and flamingos freaked out?What was the noise ?Why did the son lose his teeth and how did the antibiotics fix them\nWho was really attacking them or does it really matter if people eventually turn against one another and self implode.The ending theme of friends \"I'll be there for you\" is maybe cute for some to digest as a brilliant parody yet it comes across as shallow and a dull manner to end this social thriller.5 stars for the actors and cgi.",

And her son .. cute guy .. but it seemed as though the purpose of the film was to showcase his eyes because he sure had nothing to say . And the role of the father seemed to be to calm his wife so she didn't have to yell anymore while the daughter lived in fantasy with Friends and spoke like she was 18 rather than 13 or 14 . And the film flirted with cliche so strongly ... was there goin to be affair ... or two.. which would have been even more nauseating. Such good actors with such a garbage script.",

Like, seriously, who the, you know what, allows these movies to go out? There was no end. You get so involved and then shaft the audience with ridiculousness. I would have given this movie 10 if it had even just a half decent ending, cause i could live with a half decent ending after an amazing movie\nBut noAnd yes, i get the point of the girl couldnt watch the last episode of friends, so it's like we should all feel like that\nNo. We are meant to enjoy a movie and talk good about it.So annoyed.",
    "68": "I heard about this movie from my wife who wanted to watch it so i thought i'd give it a go even though i'm not a big fan of anything Julia Roberts has done in the past .Now there are some good bits in this film especially when a large tanker runs aground on the beach and where a jet airliner crashes those were pretty good scenes but my main beef with this movie is not only the main characters but the overall story and the ending .Some parts of it just didn't make any sense to me .I found the main characters really irritating the family who rented the house to begin with were total morons especially the father but then again i thought both the father figures in this movie were morons .And the ending i mean what was that ? I left this movie feeling quite irritated what a total waste of time.",

What was the bug all about?Flamingos on long island? Hundreds of Deer gather with a buck that looks like no deer species in NY.Why keep your garden tools in a shed a very long way from the house.Why keep your secret information secret when trying to explain why you left NYC (home owner)?Gratuitous global warming screed by Julia when nothing about what is happening is related to that in any wayThe husband gets lost due to no GPS? He is old enough to know how to read a map or ask where the town was.Random Spanish woman who could have brought him to town.Drone spreading pamphlets in the middle of nowhere for no reason.NO human beings except speaking rolesSatellites out world wide but no AM radio either.The house has electricity throughout the entire movie.Stupid love scene?Homeowners daughter acts like petulant teen even though she is covered with tattoos.Kevin Bacon survivalist takes paper money.Glad the daughter (they say she is 13 acts like she is 8) found the bunker. It wasn't locked and got to watch the end episode of Friends.

Rogue military? Reversal of the poles? Who knows who cares?",
    "70": "It's a bad stage play poorly translated to film.1. Poorly written female/childrens dialogue - the men's isn't much better though.2. Direction that's a complete mess, it's likely meant to be clever and to \"make the audience feel uneasy\" but it looks more as if they've watched the Shining alongside some Wes Anderson and Tarrantino movies and decided to mix them up. It doesn't work. It just looks amateurish at best.3. The score is used at the wrong time, it doesn't signpost tension or drama, it pulls you OUT of the experience due to how poorly timed it is. At one point there's a few notes on the piano at a dramatic moment which are completely out of place.4. The plot is a mess, vagueness included just to pass a few more minutes.5. Characters make not only illogical choices but also seem to have personality changes throughout - there's a lack of consistency.6. Chracters take turns to argue. Literally waiting on each other to finish a line so they don't talk over each other (as normal people passionately arguing would). Very - stage play-esque.The actors do a decent enough job, there are some good performances here but the writing and direction in particular are some of the most haphazard and nosensical I've ever seen.What a mess.On the plus side it's one of those movies that could possibly be saved if 30 minutes was shaved off it's runtime and some of the drivel left on the cutting room floor.",
    "71": "This started out slow and seemed to go even slower as it progressed. None of it made much sense starting with an oil tanker running aground in perfectly good weather. Sure the Internet was experiencing issues and GPS was out but for crying out loud there are people on a boat and I think they can look out a window and see the shore coming up. Same with airplanes falling out of the sky, there are still pilots in them and they certainly can override auto systems, especially in nice weather. And don't get me started on the deer who suddenly get all threatening and nasty towards people. This movie was a real clunker.",
    "72": "I was really excited for this movie, it seemed like a good thrilling watch, but it was all but that. This movie was just one mess. It was just confusing and things didn't make sense at all. The storyline was interesting tho, that's the only reason why I wanted to finish the movie else I would've quit right on the spot. Sadly, the movie was just half done. They worked their way towards nothing. The ending was just left open and once Rosie got to watch the last friends episode in the bunker it cut to black screen. Is this what I was spending 2,5 hours for? No I did not, it was such a waste of time, nothing was clear about what was happening and why it was happening. I really wanted to know what the cause was instead of just theories from George. Also wanted to know more about the animals. But, even if there would be like a sequel or anything, I wouldn't even be bothered to watch it.Apart from that, I did like the actors. The acting was pretty well done, such a waste for them aswell.I would not recommend this movie if you want to be left with disappointment. Leave this movie behind for the most time-wasting movie award.",
    "73": "The story starts really well and the suspense start building up. But for 150 minutes, the movie itself has 0 conclusions. Second, there's so many stupid things happens. For example the stupidest person that cannot drive without GPS and don't know the town were the one sent out to investigate.There's a maid that cannot speak english at all. Like,,, dude how do you work.When the older kid gets sick, they didn't think to visit the pharmacy. And they know it's an almost apocalypse but they get drunk? Are you sane??And it seems that everyone point of view only 20meters far. Cause they should be able to see things beyond by going on a high place.Give me back my 150 minutes or finish that movie by making a part 2.",
    "74": "People will cry about the ending, but the ending is the best part of the film. I won't go into details but the ending isn't the ending, it's the beginning. How people can't see that is beyond me.The film is apocalyptic horror comedy essentially. Also a dive into what makes us human and how we judge others but in reality we're just living in our own delusion. It's very meta and most people won't get it. That's fine.I really liked the tension, the acting, the score and the comedic break scenes (dancing, etc). The other way this film excels is how it uses exposition. They use character, dialogue and subtleties to slowly bring the plot. It's not for everyone but if you like cinema that's not made to be easily digested, you will like it. Well done! 7.3/10.",
    "75": "Yes, fantastic acting all around, but that does not make up for a weak plot and storyline. Filled with choppy scenes, stereotypes galore, story arcs in every direction that are left unfulfilled, one watches with the hope of seeing something.. anything.. to have some meaning behind it or advance the plot in some way. Instead, like a car wheel spinning in the mud, it spins angrily making no progress while flinging randomness everywhere. It was intriguing, but without any advancement of the plot, you will wonder why you sat through the entire 2hrs and 18mins for no real purpose. Why did we eagerly give away all that time? You can't get a refund, so be aware of the price of admission.",

How are planes and ships crashing due to whatever-this-is yet the cars and coffee makers still work? (Hint- I good writer would be consistent, a great writer would explain)\nWhat happened to all the people on the beach or at the store? They just disappeared apparently.Seriously, I can NOT get over how utterly stupid these characters are! Most people would compare and contrast information and try to figure out what is going on. These imbeciles have broken bizarre conversations as if they're trying to put on a play. Mostly I'm wondering how these good actors read this dialogue and said 'sign me up!'",

Horrible decision by making this film, the scenes were alright leading to the end. The end was the worst part of the movie. Totally can't believe I watched this movie straight through. The acting was terrible the production quality was awful. Just completely awful in so many ways, if you want to waste 2 hours of your life, watch paint dry on the wall somewhere. This makes no sense to watch whatsoever and I don't know how to explain it.",
    "78": "Why is it irritating? Because this movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It wants to be everything, it is everything but then it's nothing. It just doesn't payoff any of the things that it lead you to believe that it is. You can't give it 0 stars because it feels like it's way better than that but you can't give it 10 stars because it feels like it doesn't deserve any stars. You just feel empty and irritated after watching it. At the end of the movie you just feel like you studied for the wrong test. If this movie would have finished any of the twist it started it would be a solid 8 but yet nothing.",

They're just saying you have to do some mental gymnastics to get something out of it. They can't come up with anything good to say about it. I didn't listen to the negative reviews and wasted hours of my life on a low rent knockoff of M Night's style and tone but it just comes off as junior high copycatism. Everyone I know is talking about how Netflix has hit a new low with this one. Please don't make the same mistake I did and don't watch this trash. Even a Marvel movie has more of a story, and they don't have stories.",
    "80": "A movie is just one huge bag of bait and switch. Things are thrown at the viewer for the sake of suspense and guessing the plot only to show a middle finger at the end not connecting the dots:\nships and planes are apparently produced by Tesla these days aka not manned at allthen deers, ticks, flamingos are aka Ukrainian pigeons trained for Russians assassination if you believe Russian propaganda. But in this case trained to spread chaos and panic, got it?there are magic pills against super secret \"sound radiation waves\" or \"trained ticks\" (see above) available at your pharmacy or, maybe, they are just marketed for \"when you teeth are falling out for no apparent reason\"when civil war starts, all civilians are armed with standard nuclear weapons, just in case (city explosions + our \"medium\" protagonist 3 stage attack narrative)it looks like all you national defence agencies are bought out or on vacation because they fail to explain russian diplomats recall and prepare for the war even though, apparently, all the rich and celebrities know about the thing coming days in advance.Tesla production is booming nowadays to the point of having enough cars to block every major exit in the US! Cudos to Elonthrow in Hispanic ladies, people behaving suspiciously for no reason at all and secretive about\"major\" facts (not really) etc etcAnd the final accord, end the movie \"the king is naked\" way, so that \"intellectuals\" can always say that those who didn't like the ending are not digging deep enough or brainless sheep.",
    "81": "The film had some great visuals in parts, some awful visuals in others. In terms of a proper story it was totally disjointed and hashed together. Some good ideas but very poorly executed. Some great actors wasted on a bland script. Pointless chapterisation which didn't appear to correlate to anything that can help the viewer understand the nature of the ominous goings on that unfold. There is only one likeable character in the motion picture but that isn't enough to bring any real sense of caring as to what fate befalls him or any of them. It was basically really disappointing as I thought it would be rubbish but it started quite promisingly so gave me some false hope then it ended up going full rubbish.",
    "82": "Maybe this film sounded good when it was just a script? I don't know why actor royalty like Roberts and Hawke would sign on to a film like this. Maybe they know the director.I fell asleep two nights in a row attempting to watch this film. It initially piqued my interest with an ominous premise and a deer in the headlights on the billboard advertisement outside my apartment.A stylish set. The house had more talent than the acting. The dancing scene made me cringe. When Roberts' character was reluctant to allow the visitors inside, I thought 'this might be one of those films with relatable, and likeable, characters'. It isn't. There's a thrilling oil ship scene early on. The film fools the viewer into thinking the film will have some sort of wow-factor, but it doesn't.The characters were not very likeable, except Ali's ... and only some of the time. Bacon's cameo was enjoyable albeit just another filler scene attached to the filler scene before it and the filler scene following.Giving this film 2 stars may sound harsh, but I can't think of a reason to give it more. I was bored. I was irritated. I was disappointed. At times I was intrigued, but the experience was like opening a birthday present to find an empty box inside.Some clever ideas are on display here. And as always, well done to all those involved in the production of the film. It's still an achievement to make a film.",
    "83": "The movie has a very interesting idea, but it fails to develop it and make out of it a thriller or drama or whatever the director wanted, instead you are left for long boring minutes that lead to nowhere. It does not have an adequate pace! Long dialogs leading nowhere. It's a mystery why the house had electricity during all the movie! I better watch The Godfather, walking dead again that this movie! If you are a prepper you will notice this end of the world movie does not simulate a correct scenario, it's like making orange juice out from bananas, pears, scotch, toilet paper and ET, nothing bonds with each other insane it has such a high rating 6.6 as 12th of December 2023.",
    "84": "Some of the worst camera work I've ever seen. The shots were so ugly, didn't make sense, and were sometimes unnecessary. The colouring was blown out and so ugly. It looked like a bad student film.Soundtrack was terrible too, cheesy piano riffs at the wrong time that sounded like they were downloaded from a public domain riff site.Tons of moments where the writing just was silly or didn't make sense. Moments like how clay is totally trusting of GH and his daughter but shows no compassion to the sobbing Spanish lady in distress.When GH goes to the beach he magically doesn't see any of the bodies or wreckage directly in front of and around him, not until after he first sees one dead person the ground at his feet.And Amanda is so unrealistically suspicious of GH and his daughter that it's just irritating.",
    "85": "I'll get straight to the point, the ending is rubbish. Actually there is no ending, it just ends on a stupid part where it makes no sense and you never actually find out what happens to the family. I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life. The most annoying part is it had so much promise! It could have been excellent. I just wish I had read a review that told me after 2 hours it just ends with no explanation. Don't read on if you don't want spoilers, but it ends when the girl finds a bunker and sits down to watch the final series of friends. No idea if the family find the bunker, if they spend their last moments getting radiation poisoning because they too busy looking for the idiot girl. Nothing, just ends....don't waste your time . So sad because I was actually enjoying it, now I hate it.",
    "86": "Seriously. I don't understand what's with all the bad reviews that say the ending was terrible and left the viewer to wonder what was happening. I'm curious, are these reviewers Americans? Did they not see the computer screen message in the last scene? Or hear one of the main characters break it down in 3 easy to follow steps? D'uh.Deaf + Dumb + Blind? Really?America! Spoiler Alert: Your culture of individualism, along with a majority of citizens who are unable to think critically - is the perfect recipe for a successful coup d'etat.Heck, if American reviewers can't even understand the ending to a movie when it's literally written in black and white on a screen AND broken down in 3 easy to follow directions from a main character, then it makes perfect sense that they wouldn't understand something as \"complex\" as a bloodless coup IRL. (Especially when it's an unsuccessful first bid.) Heaven help you with the second bid, America! LOL.",
    "87": "It's an okay film. The cast deliver their performances as well as they can. And there's a bit of mystery to keep things moving along. But none of the core elements gain traction. It's like a collection of unrelated plot points brought together, but nothing comes from doing so. For example, there's a brief intimate moment between Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali's characters, but nothing comes of it. It's just there, in the film, doing nothing. And there are others. Animals behaving strangely, is one. It's a film that feels like it was designed by a committee, and everyone was allowed to have one of their ideas included in the script. Or maybe the writers drunkenly went through their draw of loose ends and ideas that didn't make it into other films and challenged themselves to make something of it all.",
    "88": "Not even the amazing cast could save this one. Absolutely awful. Pointless. I have no idea what I just watched. That was 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. I'm really sorry to leave this review as I don't like to be so negative, but I'm so disappointed in this movie. From start to end it made zero sense and was just plain dumb. So many big names attached to this movie, I have no idea how they could think this was a good script. Produced by the Obama's? Seriously? Please use your talents and intelligence somewhere other than Hollywood! Worst movie I've watched in a long time. Don't waste your time.",
    "89": "The storyline has so many unrealistic moments and unanswered questions. Loud dramatic music throughout the movie make you believe there is something serious about to happen yet the characters are drinking wine and smoking weed like they're on vacation. Once again, another movie where you devote two hrs only to discover the filmmakers dropped the ball with an abrupt, nonsensical ending. The racial messaging is a joke. Literally no one in 2023 is \"surprised\" by a successful black American. Acting is ok but what you would expect from A list actors. Nothing in the script really required or demanded an Oscar winning performances.",
    "90": "I don't even know where to start with this movie. Plot was all over the place. For the first hour and 40 minutes, I could not quite figure out if it was a thriller, drama, or romance movie. There were so many unnecessary scenes that simply made the movie too long. It's like written a college essay that needs to be 1000 words, and you simply just add filler words.After about two hours, I was done with the movie. There is a dance scene. Watching Julia Roberts trying to dance is just as cringe as watching Mahershala Ali trying to dance. Let me save you 2.5 hours by saying: do not watch this movie. It's a total waste of time.",
    "91": "With respect to the actors and actresses, my wife and I found this movie way confusing and with an inconclusive. When the credits come up for a second we thought it'd from the Friends credits but unfortunately where the movie is ended. There was no substantial evidence suggesting from the officials such a mega catastrophic blackout that led to so many confusing incidents. Movie story was jumping from one pole to another pole without any connection of the incidents. The race superiority was clearly demonstrated with such obnoxious conversations.It could have been a different story if it was followed the trails of blackout and disasters.",
    "92": "When you spend two entire hours waiting on a movie to unveil what's happening; then after a long slow, drawn-out, yawn-factor build-up, it doesn't - not really - it leaves you wondering: did someone actually get paid for this? The music was unbelievably poor, a whining collection of songs with little-boy lyrics about sex, but for the rest - it was really just a movie about what happens when the Internet goes down. Where did all the other people go? Why were the streets and roads deserted? Why was Ethan Hawke frightened by a cloud of leaflets? Why did the daughter walk off at the end, stuff herself with food in someone else's house, and sit down to watch DVDs? I really think she was bored, too. Even the people who built the easy-access doomsday bunker decided not to wait for the ending, either. Be smart - run away from this. Very fast.",
    "93": "There were some good actors on this but that's about it. The camera is all over the place trying to be clever but just makes you feel sick. The soundtrack is so wrong the songs used for not match what you are seeing in the screen. The teenage daughter of the house owner who turns up at night is annoying and obnoxious. It doesn't really make sense there are a lot of scenes done, maybe for effect? Then nothing said about them from then on. Let's have a go at white people card that seems to be the norm these days in society and movies. It was boring annoying and just didn't work. Avoid it if you can you won't be missing anything worth while.",
    "94": "This is a great film if your expectations are in the right place. It's basically a handheld guide through a first hand experience of the collapse of your civilization. It's very realistic exploration of how disruption of all that we rely on in modern society and the associated fear and confusion one would experience could quickly develop into a societal explosion.But that is just the surface and those who were avid fans of Mr Robot will be happy to discover the brain teasers/easter eggs imbued in this film by Sam Esmail. Keep an eye on the paintings on the walls, the logos on the products, and anomalies in the graphics.The only downside to this film for me is the casting of Julia Roberts. Never was a fan and over the years I just can't stand watching her on screen. In this film where she is playing an abrasive character its an even more trying experience.",
    "95": "I am so sad. Great, thoughtful acting. Fantastic, inventive directing. Eerie, compelling score. Great character study, particularly when Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali shared the screen. And then... a totally butchered ending.Without giving anything away, one character is roaming through a house, and I turned to my husband and said, \"Watch. They're going to find a DVD.\" And they did, and then the credits rolled. C'mon! What a joke. And it really had me drawn in up until that point. I guess they were going for irony, maybe, but it was just eye-rolling.Also (sort of spoiler), Tesla's require GPS to self-drive.I usually hate putting anything spoiler-ish into a review, but the movie was ruined by these two things. This could have easily been 8 or 9 stars otherwise. Worth watching for the performances, especially if you love these actors.",
    "96": "I wanted to watch the entire film before giving my review, because this is a project that is actually a nightmare of mine, that I have quite often with the exact same scenario that the writers, Director and producer executed with this film. Honestly this would be such a phenomenal series. It has so many possibilities and the horror from that alone is very intense. The possibilities of who what and why. I noticed a lot of mixed reviews in regards to actually instructing you on what the plot was about and I've noticed that people need everything explained to a tea with perfect instructions and a perfect dissection of everything they interact with and watch, or they lose interest. You really don't have to have a high capacity to understand with this film is about and I think they executed perfectly because in a real case scenario, that's exactly what it would be like. The most real situation was the encounter with Kevin Bacon because your best friend and your neighbors are now the enemy, anyone that might be after what you have to survive. I felt every character was full of depth and could have easily gone off on stories of their own especially the daughter lost in the woods.The ending was also perfect. People said it ended too early in the story, or it ended with no answers.You got your answer on the computer screen in the bunker.It's a Red Dawn / Invasion of another country. But could it have been America after all? That's the horror.Earlier in the film, when is a little girl was complaining she wouldn't find out about Ross and Rachel and then at the very end she's in the bunker, and she finds the final episode of friends to watch it. It was that little bit of happiness that she was desperately looking for in a world full of chaos. She got it. That was the most hopeless part. It's over now.",
    "97": "My review title says it all. I found myself thinking about how I would handle this situation. Instead of the typical apocalyptic scenario, the movie isolates a small group of people facing questions with no answers, the problems of no longer having our electronic digital Wi-Fi world and what do we do next to survive. It didn't have to show a vast amount of people suffering through the same consequences of what turns out to be the beginning of cyber turned conventional war because you can assume almost everyone in the world is in the same dilemma.I don't think there could have been a definite ending to the movie such as a \"the hero saved the world\" type ending. Instead, the movie ended with me thinking what happens now, just like the characters are asking themselves.No, this was not your average someone is going to blowup the world movie but a movie showing what can happen when someone changes the rules of how we live on a daily basis. I thoroughly liked it, it'll make you think.",
    "98": "Arrrrrrgh. I HATE wasting 2h on a movie that goes nowhere. No ending. Okay story at most.I hated all the characters in this movie. There's pretty much no plot. Just loooooong and boring. And then you get to the end, thinking you'll get answers for whatever is going on buy NOPE. No ending at all. So yeah, don't waste your time on this movie, guys, as you will never get it back. There's absolutely nothing good about this movie. Even julia roberts is such a b**ch in this movie i couldn't. Cringe at some points, boring at others, and nothing at the end. That kind of movie should come with a warning.",
    "99": "There's little to say about this product. No story, no characters, no one to root for or care. Laughable attempts of suspense, dizzing photography that thinks it's cool, terrible editing and structure.It feels like a 90-minute script that was streched as much as possible to fit the two and a half hours mark for no reason, quickly put together with a few big name actors to atract eyes, and that's it. This thing is closer to a product than a film, saddly - no poetry, no art, no subtleness or care, heart, a story to tell. Netflix is know for publishing trash most of the time, but this one is specially mediocre. Not worth a watch even for the curious, I strongly recommend to go watch something else.",
    "100": "This was lame. None of the actors' reactions or personal interactions were believable - if you or I were in any of these situations where some random dad and daughter knocks on your door, you wouldn't let them in to sleep the night and with your teenage daughter and son.. Nor would you magically just have established enough of a bond to later that next day be drinking and dancing with them like you were about to have an affair. And then Julia Roberts reaction to the daughter of the stranger was never believable...none of us would have reacted like this. The ending was a big let down as well. Don't waste your time.",
    "101": "The movie started off seemingly interesting and the music played into it with making you believe the tenseness of the moment, but one moment after another with crazy unbelievable things happening which could have been explained later and actually become a good movie, but it did not. What a shame to have these good actors in such a very poor movie. Obviously the writer didn't know where he was going with the story because the story rambled around and around and to top it off left you with no ending! How can you have a story with no ending? Well it did. Shame on them. They could have had a good movie if they had actually rewritten the script! Was this supposed to be an end of days movie? So many questions at the end which should have been answered. Why this and why that? But, not explained. Shame on them. Waste of time watching.",
    "102": "This film is truly bad in every way. It's like one of those really amateurish B movies that used to be made in the 1950s. Whatever was Julia Roberts thinking of when she signed up for this one? Must be the end of her career? Kevin Bacon is heavily disguised and only in the film briefly (he has the right idea). The script is cringeworthy. The Plot is full of holes. One of those films where one is watching only to see if it can get any better and what it is all about. The ending is a big disappointment more questions than answers. Really do not waste your time. I can not think of one positive thing to say the one star is one star too many.",
    "103": "So long yet nothing happens.So tense yet\n90% of the tension comes from bizarre camera angles and strange soundtrack choices in a vain effort to distract you from the fact that this movie doing nothing.Boring. Boring.

And the answer is: they'd sit around and wander around and generally mope around. That's very boring. Nothing about this movie hits. Nothing about this movie hits any of the right notes.I want my time back!",

Vapid, slow, filled with false drama and poor exposition.Plus the absolutely worst musical track I have ever heard.The movie is clearly directed by a dude who thinks he knows how to manipulate people's feelings but he doesn't.He's created a movie that longs forbetter writing and directing.Oh, the acting is OK but the actions arent. They are unbelievable. The only people who think others behave this way are those who live in the echo chamber and have zero grasp on real life.And that brings me to the final point. The entire film has plot holes like a swiss cheese the size of Ethiopia.I was bored out of my mind and feel that this movie was a bit of an insult to my intelligence.",
    "105": "What a pitiful, ham-fisted attempt at a slow burn...to nowhere. I see awards on the horizon: for Most Obtrusive Soundtrack and Worst Blatant Product Placement @ the Tip of a Catastrophe!I'm a fan of the 10 minute test for unknown quantity films. Given Amanda's (Juliet Roberts) grating, stage-y opening monologue, I very nearly abandoned this one at the 3:20 mark. Oh, to have a redo on that call! At least wait for Mahershala Ali, I told myself. He has second billing! Don't do it, people; don't wait for Mahershali Ali (GH). Of course he's good. But he's no saving grace here, because there is no grace. The good news is, he enters about 20 minutes in-the very bad news is there's still two hours left of this pointless poop. Denzel got out apparently; why oh why didn't I.I almost fled again, minutes later, right after a huge decision was made. Because the film lost all credibility for me then. That's the moment.Something unexplained, but clearly foreshadowing terrible things, had just occurred that was obviously tied to this person's request, yet: Two grown adults both failed to make that connection; second, their choice is entirely at odds with the power dynamic and proclivities of the people involved; and lastly, the new character is so pointedly telling a whopping lie it's inconceivable anyone would let it slide. Let alone anxious people perched at the edge of a crisis. But nooo, I had to stick around to see if Mahershala Ali (damn you!) was as mysterious as he seemed. Ha!After overstaying, among other things, I found myself wondering what the chances were, genetically, that a brown-eyed mother could give birth to only blue-eyed children (hint: not good), and the height of flamingoes. Let's just say the plot allows ample time to pursue your thoughts.Is the film trying to make a point about the dumbed-down, cynical, phone-addicted, helpless nature of Americans? Sure, but it dilutes its own suspense on the way to saying little about it.",
    "106": "The book was poorly written, pretentious and so bad it actually made me angry. The hype and fellow author reviews were totally undeserved and basically total falsehoods. It was a sound premise very poorly executed. Thankfully I paid 39p for it online, if I'd paid the full cover price, I would have tracked the author down and demanded my money back. This movie however is very, very good. Mr Mass Email (not a typo) has had a HUGE hand in this - probably sat next to the books author and showed him how to construct a gripping tale with clever social commentary and even a somewhat open ending which is satisfying - admittedly that last thing is hard to do in a novel. The cast are outstanding, Julia Roberts is unlikeable - how hard is it for her to make that work? I love her, always have, but at times I was glaring at her! It is a slow burn but if you can immerse yourself in it, it is well worth it. The set pieces - some of which are from the book so kudos for that - are very well played. The overall feeling of menace and doom is constant, it is gripping, it is terrifying.You're going to need to pay attention and think, judging by a lot of the reviews here a lot of people cannot do that and just want whoosh...aliens..bad guys...BANG!!If you haven't read all the light you cannot see you will think the TV show is great but those of us who have read the book know it's fine, but falls well short of the written version. The opposite of this show is so true, a terrible book becomes a brilliant movie. Well done Sam.",

I'm not talking about conspiracy theories, I am talking about the smallest details within this film that you might overlook, but mean something.We are so wrapped up in our lives and fears that we lose track of what is important or should I say that we as humans are easily distracted by the powers at be, by shiny objects, and by the media.Watch this film closely, and get your message from it.

(It seems to be a trend of making movies with open endings.) It doesnt have to be some easy predictable ending where the good guy(s) win, or some hero saves the day, but damn, wrap it up for us somehow.Part social commetary, part warning of horrible humans' behavior, even part fantasy (whats with the animals?). But all a stranded mess.This is why people flock to the moronic, simpleton cartoon-ey comic book flicks...at least they know what they're getting. This one tried to be smart, then failed.Too bad.

Indeed snotty Roberts and her simp hubby Hawke in particular seem totally miscast. Meanwhile, Kevin Bacon pops up for a brief moment towards the end in a rather redundant cameo.The film actually starts off 'ok' once the family unit arrive in upstate New York on a quick staycation getaway from the city (the albeit far-fetched tanker scene impresses), but things soon descend into a series of dull, drawn out episodes that lack conviction, thrills or excitement. That's the main probelm here - there is no payoff, you just keep hoping it'll take off but it never does!There are zero twists or 'wow' moments that the script is literally crying out for and it all becomes way too talky, non-sensical and downright boring. In fact by journeys end the movie descends into cringe/laugh-out=loud territory, while the ending is a total cop out that just makes you shake your head in disbelief and disdain.What should've been something more akin to a top Stephen King/M Night Shyamalan effort is nothing more than a throwaway episodic mess you could watch and instantly forget on Hulu or Peacock. No surprise though seeing as the director is direct from television. A total bomb that even Elon Musk would be reluctant to invest in...",

    "114": "By all appearances this movie was well done - great storytelling, good cinematography, well-known actors, and a popular end-of-civilization context. It had a sort of Hitchcockian feel to it, with lots of moments of suspense.The problem is the movie was a giant nothing-burger. There are ridiculous quantities of books and movies that deal with the same subject matter - sans the grade-A actors, and the high Netflix budget - that have already done a WAAAAAAAY better job than this movie.This movie \"tackles\" the \"problem\" of racist-motivated bigotry amidst the backdrop of the fall of modern civilization.The characters that the grade-A actors portray are remarkably under-developed and stereotypically obtuse.A cynical and darkly hateful white woman. A gentlemanly and sophisticated black man who wants to do the smart thing for everyone. An affable and naive white man who can't see the obvious things going on around him until they smack him in the face. A horny and simple white boy who is kind to his sister. A black girl who is clearly angry at all white people, and sees the worst in everybody - painted as the uninhibited \"truth-teller\". And an easy to overlook white girl who is stuck at the mercy of the older people around her with a small voice. Don't forget the harsh and selfish white man with a gun who refuses to help his neighbor when it all hits the fan - who was expecting a calamity of this type for quite some time and generally not surprised in the least when it finally happens.There's nothing new in this movie. No new angle. No deep philosophy or moral. You've got radical progressive racism meets a real world calamity. The end is just....... meh.There's a few briefly glimmering moments of realization. Oh, we NEED each other. Oh, that angry white woman you don't trust just risked her life to save yours. Oh, that gun toting white male prepper was prepared for something you thought was not even possible.But the glimmering transient moments of clarity are drowned out by the overt political agenda of the film. Like, if it's an emergency \"what's yours is mine\" simply because I need it. Like, when all is said and done, \"white people can't be trusted\" at the end of the day. Like, entitlement knows no bounds in every scenario.If there was something to be learned from this movie, it's drowned out by the strong overtones of the popular messaging of modern progressive society.",

They wait until the second half of the movie to really slather it on you, but if you have eyes to see, you will have seen it coming. CNN, MSNDC and WAPO being in the newsfeed on the phone. T-shirts with \"OBEY\" and \"NASA\" printed on them. If you know then you know. If you don't then it's too late for you.Regardless, it's just an awful movie. It doesn't go anywhere.

As mentioned above,could of been done better with Kevin.Also.. Julia goes from a people hater to dance queen(cough)to almost being inappropriate with a person(G. H.)she cared less about. It was one of many awkward scenes,between the characters interacting.The teeth part was gross,but not even scary.. Oh sure Kevin(Danny)gives an explanation as to perhaps why,even though it was also mentioned about a bug bite prior.. Do we care anymore? Was just waiting for the son to become a zombie,at least although clichéd would of been-Something!Yes it does reveal what went on(when Rose finds the bunker)so we get some answers but,where many feel upset is the odd & perhaps abrupt ending..\nSo you wonder does the son get sicker,do they survive & will things finally be normal again.Rose also told a story about a man,signs & meeting God..\nIt was insightful think overall the movie wasn't cohesive in parts or direction,otherwise it would of just felt more complete as credits rolled.Also when certain parts did show promise in suspense & so forth,it was cut short or basically ruined..\nSuch an example was the ominous deer scenes,if something is repeatedly shown than do better with it. Why are they acting strange to hurt any human,due to sickness & need help or what?Anyway.. Want a disaster type movie,skip this & watch anything else.There's a part of me that feels this movie was a human study on what we think or feel,if such an event happened without full resolve & with that said..\nIf the O's felt strong enough to be listed as executive producers do we need to be concerned,event foreshadowing perhaps -vs- just bad movie taste?Edit-\nDid anyone see not long after this movie premiered that Tesla issues massive recall,of more than 2 million vehicles over autopilot safety concerns..

The way they successfully describe the evolution of a global apocalypse here is disturbing, but absolutely true. It's likely that it won't come with a Big Bang, but with a whimper, a creeping process, which no one is able to understand or control, during everything looks like normal, but under the surface, invisible, everything has already changed with fatal consequences. The occuring events are enigmatic and the uneasiness resulting from that is perfectly shown by camera movements, montage of sequences and sound design.Nature is out of balance, natural and technical ressources come to an end, our total slavish dependance on digital gadgets makes us vulnerable, a perfect target. Ignorance won't help us out. It's devastating that many of the viewers are already unable to get the crystal clear message of this movie.

The Social commentary on our addiction to technology along on America and their involvement in other regions and distrust it has created around the world clearly shows in this film.Some people maybe disappointed as it is promoted as run of a mill thriller and not as a Social Thriller. I reckon that may disappoint some viewers but considering the Brilliant Oscar Winners Julia Roberts and Maharsha Ali on the lines of Jennifer Lawrence's Mother! Should know that it is something more substantial, a commentary on the American society.",

If you're boring - just turn friends on instead (few will appreciate that pun).There's so many takeaways from this movie to be had. At the very least, the takeaway is simply just having fun watching a movie with so much to offer.If you've seen Mr Robot, you know Sam Esmail will bend your mind a little and provide a completely different side to cinema.

    "120": "\"Leave The World Behind\" is an entertaining one that keeps you fully immersed with its grappling thriller that is the apocalypse, while never becoming too overbearing/dull because of how it's masterfully edited. While most films want you to focus on one character, the editing quickly plays out scenes in a way where you try to figure out what each character is looking at as different scenarios are happening in one sequence which I think was such a great boiling point to keep the suspense flowing. The characters were also introduced well, each with their unique personalities that you can analyze. Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali's dynamic is one I loved seeing on-screen. Every scene between them just felt natural.The film is thrilling, fun, and nonsensical at times. Perhaps, the lesson that came out of \"Leave The World Behind\" is that nothing matters so you just ought to do something you'd want to enjoy for your last day on Earth, and that consuming pop culture is important for that matter.",

The abrupt ending leaves viewers perplexed and dissatisfied, as if the filmmakers decided to abandon the story midway through. The title ironically echoes the sentiments of the audience, as they are left stranded in a narrative limbo, yearning for closure.While the initial build-up showcases the film's promise, the incomplete nature of \"Leave the World Behind\" is a disservice to its otherwise commendable qualities. A movie that could have easily earned an 8/10 is instead burdened with a 4/10 rating due to the frustration and disappointment induced by its unfinished state. This cinematic experience is a clear case of a captivating story left untold, leaving audiences behind in a state of narrative abandonment.",

Each frame is a visual feast, seamlessly blending colors and lighting to create a mesmerizing atmosphere.The performances of the cast are commendable, especially considering the challenging material they were given. The chemistry between the lead actors adds depth to the characters, but the script fails to provide them with a solid foundation. Moments of brilliance are overshadowed by a convoluted plot that leaves too many unanswered questions.The soundtrack, while emotionally resonant, struggles to find its place within the narrative, often feeling forced and disconnected. The choice of music is eclectic but lacks a cohesive theme, leaving the audience unsure of the film's intended emotional impact.The pacing of the film is a rollercoaster, with moments of intense action abruptly giving way to prolonged periods of introspection. The lack of a consistent rhythm makes it difficult for viewers to fully engage with the story, resulting in a sense of detachment.\"Leave the World Behind\" attempts to explore profound philosophical themes, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The film's ambiguity, while intentional, becomes a source of frustration as it overshadows any potential for a satisfying resolution.In conclusion, \"Leave the World Behind\" is a visually striking but narratively perplexing experience. While it boasts moments of brilliance and a stellar cast, the film's lack of coherence ultimately hinders its potential.

People are handling that the best they can and always win in the and.

I have no objection to a kind of horror/satire where the characters need to be flat and 2-dimensional for that style of storytelling to work. They Live would be an example of such a film. Nor do I object to movies with unhappy endings. What I object to is going nowhere with those kinds of choices.Nearly every scene in this movie has dialogue and character that is perfunctory or on-the-nose. Characters are inconsistent without any point or payoff to it, not even in the tone of the movie or the observations of those characters. Character motivations are at times entirely broken for the sake of the scene needing to go somewhere else.Similarly, half of the scenes have no point to them, not even in the subtler sense of tone-building and anecdotal observation.What was attempted was a movie about societal fears all colliding and coming together. What was acheived is 'how not to write a non-standard screenplay', which is doubly painful when we are in need of better non-standard screenwriting.As a cherry on top, this script uses the word 'nonplussed' in the solecistic way without gaining anything from the character using it wrong. The word means 'so confused or surprised as to not know what to do'. Pretentious idiots use it to mean 'not impressed' or 'not bothered'.",

The youngest girl is very good though.The super obvious (heavy handed) societal commentary delivered via awkward monologues (primarily from Julia Roberts) feel like a stern lecture from one of your least favorite teachers.The family melodrama, including cringeworthy scenes that threaten unlikely liaisons, is strictly grade B stuff, and the creepy innuendo not only goes nowhere (thank God) but also has nothing to do with the overall story.The thriller part though, that's actually decent, even with the nonsensical vignettes (one person's teeth fall out, but no one else's do, even though they were all exposed to all the same things; large herds of deer threaten some of the players for no apparent reason, and no other woodland animals appear; and the only self driving cars that crash into each other forming a large roadblock are all one brand and the same color. And yes, I know these are all metaphors. But they don't connect to anything all that well.) The other special effects are convincing.The end of the film has equal parts original Planet Of The Apes, and Looking For A Friend For The End Of The World.Here are the most defining things I can say about it: I wanted to fast forward through the overdone dialogue scenes, and...I'll never watch it again.

Each scene felt like a cliché borrowed from countless other movies, and the poor acting had me laughing out loud throughout.The film's amateurish camera angles, constantly twisting and turning, gave it a vibe as if it were shot by a film student in college.Creating fewer movies like this would be wise, as more of its kind could potentially lead to an apocalypse.What a chaotic mess.",

The few and slow reveals never deliver something unexpected until the end or better say final cut as it has no end.As everything can be declared entertainment and making people feel uneasy can be recognized as an artistic achievment, some people wil say - oh somehow the movie touched me (first class actors), so it hit its goal. Otherwise..\nMaybe it can be an inspiration for an apocalyptic sermon. But even that would fail. From what should you turn back? From watching Friends, eating bio food, driving Tesla...?

Unless you are aware of these psychological hooks you'll be anchored.This is nothing more than a movie which is trying to alter the global consciousness.Btw the storyline is absolute dross.

It balances it perfectly with drama, conspiracies and a good storytelling. Its very well put together.A solid good and deep psychological thriller that wont stop being thrilling.

Leaving the world behind is a great thriller with some really nice mystery Aspects.What I enjoyed the most was a storyline really not that predictable as some would believe. For the most Part I even didn't know what the background to the story is.Characters are really well written and beautifully executed. Every actor plays their role really well, some times even to well. The general feeling between characters is often so vage that the viewer can interpret a lot into conversations and actions which peps up the interactions.I did enjoy the mystery part. It is a film with a huge chunk of thriller and a smaller one for drama though I believe there was also a tiny bit of horror in there.The reason why this movie has bad reviews is probably that the US is being portrait as really weak. As far as I can see, the movie was well worth it and I enjoyed the ending, even more because it's not that happy ending everyone would have wanted.",

The owner of the house, George (Mahershala Ali) and his daughter return back. How these two families cope up together when their world is getting attacked forms rest of the story.Firstly the things that didn't work was how none of these characters have a proper arc. We are given little details about both the families and it is just them reacting to the crisis they are forced into. This stayed throughout though the characters do overcome their differences but it is still not enough to get invested in them. Sure with actors like Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, one might expect them to pull it through with their performances. The characters do provide some explanation to why they behave the way they do yet it didn't feel sufficient.Then there are the deers and flamingos, for what the final reveal was, the scenes featuring them simply felt like a gimmick. Apart from these shortcomings, the actor did perform well in their roles and there are several shots that stood out in the film. The slow narrative however becomes overbearing frequently and with a lengthy runtime, the impact goes missing before the final act begins. It is still a one time watch for the actors alone but they clearly deserved a better screenplay as well as the characters they play to be well rounded, character arc wise.",
    "136": "It could've been shorter but Leave the World Behind remains a slow burning thriller that uses its absolute lack of subtlety to create an apocalypse where the foundations are so fragile it doesn't take much to kick things into gear. It's fun to see Netflix champion physical media, it's withholding of answers until the end works and it's essentially just the Happening but actually good.This is an all star cast at the top of their game. Ethan Hawke brings his charm to a character who's initially way too easy going. Julia Roberts is delightfully cynical and Mahershala Ali uses that natural screen presence to put everyone at ease in such a stressful situation. Kevin Bacon's paranoid prepper could've been in it more but his small presence still ratchets up the tension beautifully.Sam Esmail's direction eschews anything understated in favour of old fashioned epic chaos. The camera glides through the confined spaces with bold framing and stylish framing that quite literally puts everything on edge. Equally old fashioned and lacking in any subtlety is Mac Quayle's score which so lovingly recreates a Hitchcockian sense of looming peril.",
    "137": "There have always been good movies and bad. I remember when there were a hell of a lot more good ones. But I also remember when the viewing public used to be able to tell the difference.The insane number of positive reviews can only mean one of two things in my view. Either people have lost the ability to recognize quality or they're a whole lot of bot reviews.This was like a homage to the days of early Netflix movies when they produced films that had a really intriguing premise, but ultimately fizzled and went nowhere.I'm not criticizing the acting, which was quite good. It was really nice to see Ethan hawke and Julia Roberts again. Seems like it's been awhile.The filming was good too. And the pace. And the atmospheric quality of it over privileged family living a life so comfortable that they were in a state of detachment that slowly deteriorated as this new reality set in.But like so many other projects it was the writing that killed it. There are so many ways this movie could have ended that might have made it good. But the director didn't go down any of those paths.I stayed up until 3:00 a.m. Because for 90% of the movie I was truly intrigued. And then I watched the last 10 minutes and the only thing that I could think was there's two and a half hours of my life and a bunch of sleep I'll never get back.I even looked it up to see if it was another M. Night shalamalamadingdong movie. This kind of nonsense is his signature style. Nope.Well I'm off to bed. I'm really happy to have discovered this director so that I can follow his projects in the future and make sure I don't watch any of them.",
    "138": "I'm happy I didn't listen to the bad reviews here and skipped this movie. It's very well made.And yes, it raises more questions than it answers, but this is how it would be during an apocalypse or cyber attack. You wouldn't know what's going on and wouldn't trust anyone fully, you could only rely on some bits and pieces of information.It wasn't boring at all, very engaging actually. The fact that most questions that come to mind when watching it are not answered, leave you thinking about what you would do and even question things in life you take for granted.This movie is only uncomfortable for those who don't wanna use their imagination and own thoughts and expect a movie to put every answer in their mouths.I haven't seen such a thought provoking, elegant yet unsettling movie in a long time!Oh and by the way... the big question everyone has, what's actually going on is answered at the end, just pay attention to the conversation in the car and the computer screen.. It's all there..\nWhat happens after? Well, finally a movie that allows you to use your own thoughts.",
    "139": "Childish attempt to make a real life movie.Not the screenplay writer or producer show any artistic skills.The cast selection is ridiculous.The storyline has breaks in it , that makes yhe whole motion picture hard to watch.Don't eve think about taking your kids with you to watch this piece of human excrement , called movie\nBetter take a walk than loose the time watching it.I'm actually enraged that I gave it my time. The characters are as thin as infomercial shills, the dialogue feels like eavesdropping on a check out line that's hours long, the plot is off screen, and the author includes nuggets of wisdom such as, one is a father forever.",
    "140": "This film has an A-list cast, thought-provoking premise and is a good flick. Leave the World Behind.makes you think and requires attention to detail. If you are a person who doesn't like either, then this film is not for you. Julia Roberts, playing a full-on Karen, is a married mom of two. She and her rather- passive husband, played by Ethan Hawke, are renting a home outside New York for the weekend. Soon after arriving, they lose their internet connection, their phones die and the TV stops working. Soon the owner of the rental and his daughter, (played by Mahershala Ali and Myha'la, knock at their door in the middle of the night and request to stay overnight .in their house with the renters due to a blackout in the city. From there, the story unfolds slowly building on a number of strange and apocalyptic occurrences and how these two families of strangers bridge initial feelings of mistrust, overcome prejudices and bond to try to figure out what is happening and how to survive. Tho actors play off each other very well. Shout out to Kevin Bacon for always making his mark, no matter how big or small the role. The haunting score also keeps you on edge as you join the characters in trying to figure out what is happening. A number of reviewers claim the ending is a fail. I disagree. If you don't get it, then you probably weren't paying close enough attention. The daughter's character very clearly explains what the last episode of Friends means to her and why it's important.",
    "141": "With a top cast, an original concept and from a well-known book, Leave the world behind has a great promise. The best description is an apocalyptic thriller with worldly twists. Ultimately though, almost no effort is made to get a good connection going with the characters, which let to a film falling flat for me. Allow me to explain.The film begins with interesting shots and conversations, but also with inconsist shots - sometimes round, sometimes quick, sometimes wide, or far zoomed in - and totally random and painful music choices, including one of those terribly lazy autotune theme songs, completely at odds with the rest of the musical score, that itself is, although meant as scary, little more than random soundscapy stuff.I'm a forgiving reviewer who supports all art, but this time it took me out of the film too quickly, and made me notice plot inconsistensies that I would have easily forgiven otherwise. As a result, it starts failing big time after that. Because what is supposed to be scary, falls short when in the first part of the movie there was absolutely no effort made to establish empathy or understanding even.That's not to say its concept isn't cool (which I'll leave open should you want to discover it) but the manner these people react to things that should have anyone in sharp survival mode, banding together, is just beyond believable at times. Almost no choice made sense, which made the supposedly deep conversations meandering at best. It's downright awful at times and halfway through I couldn't care less if they all just perished.Sorry I couldn't be my usual positive reviewer this time, and absolutely no fault of the actors of course whatsoever, who play very well (Roberts is an amazing performer, and so are all the others hands down) but to me, the film felt off, as if it was missing its beats, and its direction of what it was trying to tell us.As an artist, I can see the attempt at something highly original, which is much appreciated. Also, you may have a better time than me putting it on if you can look through it and accept it as a weirder thriller with a worldly theme. But as is,\nwith no empathy, even with its big theme, shown in massive and well-done sequences, and an ending that if the film was executed better would have made you gasp and be amazed ... it just doesn't click. To the point it baffled me.",
    "142": "I watched \"Leave the World Behind\" in two parts, and I think it would have been better as a TV mini-series than a movie that lasts over two hours. Keep reading to see where I'm coming from.The movie, based on a novel by Rumaan Alam, shows how different people cope with a global crisis while staying in a small town away from the big cities. The movie never explains what is going on and has many mysterious events that create a creepy atmosphere but doesn't really go anywhere.The movie has good technical aspects, but I have some issues with it:1. It is too long for a movie that has little action and mostly takes place in one location.2. The actors are well-known (like Julia Roberts, Ethan Hawke and Kevin Bacon) but their acting here is not very impressive. In particular, Ethan Hawke is doing a mediocre job throughout.3. The ending - it is not an ending, it leaves many things unresolved and although leaving the audience with something to think about is good, but this is too little.4. The soundtrack and its mixing are terrible, I cringed every time a song came on, some soundtracks are forgettable, this one is just bad.I think making this into a 5-6 episode mini-series with 45 minutes each would have solved these problems. The movie already has different chapters with their own titles, like in the novel, as a series a lot of the movie shortcomings could have been forgiven, and there was an opportunity to build more depth to the characters and the story.Overall, it is not a bad movie if you don't mind a slow-paced story with no clear conclusion. Guide: No blood, no nudity, no violence, some sexual innuendos, minor use of smoking and guns. My exact score: 59 / 100.",
    "143": "Let me start with a joke\nJoke: A Bread, A Pita and a priest walk into a bar and the priest says to the Bread...\nHope you enjoyed my joke! Difference between my \"joke\" and this movie is that my joke only wasted 5-10 seconds of your time.All along I was waiting for this movie to finally start, but it never started. The whole movie was an intro, a horrible intro with so much promise!Nothing is explained and nothing makes sense, whatever COULD had made sense, lost all sense when they mixed sugar with salt, the cake is not sweet, nor salty, its simply horrible!Good cast, good actors, good everything, but wtf is wrong with the writer? He was trying to bake a pizza but ended up forgetting everything and came out with regular old plain, tasteless bread.So many analogies, but none can express my anger, my rage, my... ugh!",
    "144": "The tension and plot builds as the movie goes along, you start to ignore events and want the answer to why these events are occurring.A good cast with good production values sets you up to expect an enjoyable ride, but it never quite gets there.I kept glancing at my watch wondering how they intended to satisfy the curiosity they created in the ever diminishing time left, the answer was sadly obvious, they couldn't.Someones had a good story about the end of life as we know it, sold the concept as a movie, but never had an ending. It all just stops with a few minutes of facts and answers squeezed into a small scene dropped on you as if to say \"there we just stole some time from you\".Or they hope to make a sequel to pull more time of you, it's hard to tell.",
    "145": "I don't think there is anything I hate more than a really well made film, that leaves us with an incredibly weak ending. Leave The World Behind holds so much promise, and so much to desire, as it makes the viewer believe there is an answer to the chaos we're watching unfold, hanging in the balance, that is worth waiting 2 and a half hours for.. and then, while we do receive an answer, it just doesn't feel adequate.The only way I would feel better about this film, is if there was a sequel to look forward to for more answers and depth, however I don't see that happening. Much like another review that I read, this film would have made a better series that continued after this ending.Julia Roberts is my FAVORITE actress of all time, and she doesn't disappoint in this film.. but like I'm almost certain I've said five times now, I just felt cheated after that ending. Very meh, despite its attempt to be witty and full circle.",
    "146": "Legitimately one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't even understand what just happened.I L ove Julia Roberts, Ethan, Hawke, and Kevin Bacon, but this was just bad.Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my whole life.I don't even understand what I just watched. Maybe I'm stupid. But I'm not. It was just bad.The ending made no sense to me. There was no real resolution. It was just kind of all over the place.I would recommend watching it so you can appreciate every other movie you've ever watched because this one is so bad.Very disappointed in this ridiculous movie.",
    "147": "I haven't left a review in ages here but I felt the need to warn people of about this piece of trash that I painfully sat through for two hours.The story was a mess with nothing clear at any stage of the movie.The acting was atrocious as was the dialogue. These are supposedly big famous actors but even they at some point must question the entire project.It just ended with no explanation.It wasn't even trying to be vague about the plot ,there was no plot.A lot of people have compared this to M Night movies but it was just awful.The eerie music was constant for no reason as there was nothing scary or intense.Again do not watch this piece of garbage.",
    "148": "Of all things, a global streaming platform like NETFLIX sings the praises of the DVD collections of the analogue age. That's an announcement. But one after anonther!Amanda Sandford (Julia ROBERTS) rushes into booking a vacation home for herself and her family (ACADEMY AWARD nominee Ethan HAWKE as her husband and two teenage children) on Long Island to escape the hustle and bustle of New York City for a weekend. Everything is going quite well until an oil tanker suddenly runs aground and comes to a stop just in front of the family's parasol. More and more strange things happen without the family being able to find out what is actually going on. Then the alleged owner (Mahershala ALI) of the house shows up with his daughter (Myhala HERROLD) and wants to move in. And then there's a strange prepper (Kevin BACON) who noticed Amanda while she was shopping at the supermarket...A bit of Yorgos LANTHIMOS, a bit of M. Night SHYAMALAN, echoes of HITCHCOCK (THE BIRDS / NORTH BY NORTHWEST) and quite successful disaster pictures! Sam ESMAIL's film cleverly addresses the unease that quite a few people around the world feel about the changes of the last two decades. Attempts to explain the mysterious events are offered, but by no means explain everything.The film adaptation of the novel of the same name by Rumaan ALAM (in German as \"In the Middle of the Night\") features an outstanding cast that delivers more than a solid performance in sometimes chamber play-like scenes. Of course, the two ACADEMY AWARD winners Julia ROBERTS and Mahershala ALI are outstanding.Despite all the fear of the end times, the situation comedies of the 1990s remain as our last consolation as viewers. Nevertheless, in memory of the great German-American writer Vicki BAUM, one thing must be said very clearly: BE WARNED ABOUT DEER (VOR REHEN WIRD GEWARNT)!",
    "149": "As \"Leave the World Behind\" (2023 release; 141 min.) opens, we are introduced to a New York couple, Clay and Amanda. Amanda is an outright misanthrope. On a whim, she books an Airbnb for a weekend getaway on Long Island. The place is beyond a McMansion, and their teenage kids love the pool and the nearby beach. Then something very strange happens at the beach... At this point we are 10 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: this is directed by Sam Esmail, bet known for his TV work on \"Mr. Robot\". Here he brings the novel of the dame name to the screen. I have not read the novel and hence cannot comment whether the screen adaptation stays true to the novel. There are a number of particular aspects to the movie, including the camera work, with tons of extended floating shots. But also this: exposing white liberal racism (as portrayed by Julie Roberts' character Amanda), conspiracy theories (as portrayed by Kevin Bacon's character Danny), and much more. It may sound like a strange cocktail mix, but somehow the movie kept my attention from start o finish, even if its running time is a bit too long for its own good. The acting performances are top notch. In addition to Roberts and Bacon, there is also Mahershala Ali (as the Black owner of the Airbnb place) and Ethan Hawke (as Amanda's husband).\"Leave the World Behind\" started streaming on Netflix this weekend. The movie caught my attention when reading a review of it in yesterday's NY Times which was less than flattering (the reviewed kept comparing it unfavorably to the original novel, which of course I have not read). Regardless, \"Leave the World Behind\" is currently rated 75% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. If you are in the mood for an off-center apocalyptic psychological drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
