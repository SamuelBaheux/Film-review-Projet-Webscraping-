    "0": "Look, I love Monk, and it was really nice to see all the old characters again, but this was a terrible epilogue to a story that had a pretty excellent ending years ago.The series finale showed us an Adrian Monk who was a healed person, being happy, at long last, after years of torment.This movie took this happy ending and flushed it down the toilet.We're told that Covid made Monk regress completely, which was a real disservice to the character. I think a much more fun take would have been to visit Monk during Covid when the whole world had become like him, and to see him just enjoying life, and loving everyone's extra precautions.But that's not the worst of it. The worst of it is that they turned Monk not just into an unhappy man again, but actually full-on suicidal. Tonally, this was an absurd shift for the Monk universe. Way too heavy on a good day, and just a horrific choice considering that when we left Monk he was having his happily-ish ever after.The ghost of Trudy was also a terrible choice, but made so much worse by the writers going all-in on the ghosts at the end of the movie. It just didn't feel like Monk at all. It felt like some weird Lifetime movie or something.Lastly, the central mystery of the story just felt too small for the final Monk send-off. The last case we saw was him solving his own wife's murder. This one was just... not weighty at all.I think a better Monk movie would be a happy, Covid-era Monk, where he spent the movie entirely in his comfort zone, while it was the rest of the world that was newly and obsessively cleaning. A zen-like Mr. Monk against a panicking world would have given us the Monk we deserve, plenty of comedy, and movie worth making.",
    "1": "As someone with a mild case of OCD myself, I loved Monk, the TV series. So I was delighted they made this movie and it does NOT disappoint. They brought back all the characters from the end of the series that we know and love - Capt. Stottlemeier, Randy Disher, Natalie, the psychiatrist. The sets are different but have the same look & feel. Tony Shaloub is fabulous as Monk. It's amazing how he creates this character - all the neurotic tweaks which are never overdone, but just enough to make you squirm, laugh & cry all at once. I just love the scenes in the publisher's office, the rocket cockpit, the interviews with the Villain, which is hilariously modelled after Jeff Bezos. The ending made me tear up. Just great entertainment. Wish there were more movies like this.",
    "2": "I think we were all in desperate need of a \"Monk\" sequel. Thank GOD they delivered!To be honest...I was a bit dubious regarding this film. After all, the original series wrapped with such a fulfilling sense of closure for Adrian Monk. Fans finally witnessed this incredibly brilliant sleuth absorb some emotional healing after Trudy's tragic death. And after 8 perfectly executed seasons, we certainly didn't want anything to mess up Adrian's positive reformation - even 12 years later.But then, of course, the pandemic struck the \"Monk\" world and shook open a whole new portal.On the other hand, the entire storyline worked well here. The plot surrounding Jeff Bezos-billionaire-clone Richard Eden was typical Monk fare, but what really enhanced the movie was the heartfelt reunion with other favorable \"Monk\" alumni. And thank God, it wasn't overly sappy, either. I loved that Melora Hardin's \"Trudy\" was given a more essential role - as a celestial advisor supporting her husband through his emotional crisis. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED seeing \"Natalie\" again and watching that deliciously playful rapport that she and Adrian continuously share. Damn...I'd missed that! Even Randy and Captain Stottlemeyer made appearances (wish Ted Levine had received a bit more screentime or that Bitty Schram had appeared...but oh well). Not to mention, it's always icing watching Hector Elizondo work his magic as Dr. Bell (at 87, does this man ever age?) and the prolific Brooke Adams with her ever-so-friendly cameos.But this particular \"Monk\" case is something of a surprise. In this glorified extended episode, the producers also reveal a darker side of Adrian's deteriorating emotional state and even carry the character into more controversial territory. For the first time, not only is Monk depressed, but even worse, suicidal. In the series, Monk's antics and OCD brought many light-hearted chuckles and a sense of comic relief. But in this case, a now \"suicidal\" Adrian Monk takes on a more serious overtone. Though it's a bit uncertain how the pandemic stimulated such a drastic relapse, particularly for a man whose lifestyle was already accustomed to such isolated living conditions - all we know is that our hearts ache profoundly for Adrian Monk. Though the writers balance the atmosphere by incorporating several jocular moments (I just about died when Adrian stepped on that dog poop), we, as viewers largely find ourselves gravely afraid for our beloved protagonist as he learns to find himself again.But don't worry: No matter what, we're all rooting for you, Adrian!",
    "3": "If you love Adrian Monk you're going to love his last case! The original cast, minus Sharona, are back again to help Mr. Monk solve what is expected to be his last case. Full of all of his quirks, phobias and catchphrases, this film does not fail to delight true Monk fans and those who love Tony Shalhoub! Trudy's daughter is set to be married & everyone has gathered for the joyous event! But, of course, wherever Mr Monk is murder seems to follow and this is no exception.The only drawback I can find with this movie is that it's only just over an hour and a half long. Personally, I could've gone for 2 1/2 hours and still wanted more.üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº",
    "4": "I was a big fan of the original series, so, I was glad to see when this came out, but to me it was poorly written compared to most of the originals. My biggest complaint is the murder method was obvious at 32 minutes in. Second, the Monk type OCD scenes were played too long and just became tedious, slowing the plot. Third, Monk's death scene was absurd. You would think for an actual movie, they would have devised a much more intricate plot, especially considering the obvious cost and bring 2 actors out of retirement to reprise their roles. At the end it is a bit less interesting than the average Monk series episode, still enjoyable, like watching a lost episode or an alternate series finale. Maybe they'll reprise the series with better writers.",
    "5": "I have to confess that I never watched his TV show, but I was aware of the outline of his mannerisms. So watching this movie allowed me to be immersed with his different OCD habits. And it has been a lot of fun. When he stepped in the dog do, and then decided he had to bury his shoes and socks, as an alternative to amputation, that was a riot. His own sanitizer station that he brought into the building, but wouldn't let anyone else use it. Things that added so much to his character. And a very clever way that he was able to put together all the different pieces of the puzzle. I had guessed how the murder was done, but it was interesting how everything came together. And the last part, where all the ghosts of the victims of the cases he solved, and cases still waiting to be solved was a very fitting approach.",
    "6": "Some things are better left alone and this proves my point to a tee. It was nice to see some of the old faces but it would be better to use still photos as the a tors look so old especially Traylor Howard who at only 57 has had so much work done she looks 75. The premise of the story is ok but the way the film continues is so corny. Ted Levine conveniently works for the killer which is absurd and although Tony Shalhoub recreates Monk well enough and the fact that enough time has passed for us to stop grieving the end of the show and be grateful that it had stopped rather than drift into this putrid.",
    "7": "Adrian Monk returns with even more OCD than he had when the regular show started back in 2002.Having had a difficult time during the Covid pandemic. His various ailments and neurosis have relapsed.Facing financial difficulties when his book deal falls through. All the publisher had to do was get the ghostwriter to write the book. Monk is upset that he would not be able to pay for Molly, his stepdaughter's wedding.However it never goes that far. Her fianc√©, Griffin an investigative journalist is killed in a bungee jumping accident.Only Molly thinks it is murder. He had ruffled the feathers of tech billionaire Rick Eden (James Purefoy) who is preparing to go into space. Griffin implied that he might have killed his business partner.The movie serves as a backdoor pilot. It is just a shame that it is not a good story. Eden is a thinly disguised Bezos rip off but a murdering one.Monk comes across as irritating rather than a brilliant detective with OCD issues.",
    "8": "This was a perfect continuation of the Monk TV series. Anybody who was a fan of the TV show will love this movie. Shows like this are very far and few between these days. After watching it, it reminded me of the beauty of a crime drama with the perfect blend of humor along with it to make the story interesting and the viewer engaged. I was unaware they were making this movie but I am hoping there will be many more because they don't make them like this anymore. It's a nice family show/movie that will keep the entire family entertained. The characters all work well together and that's what also makes the environment work. Enjoy!",
    "9": "How did this movie get a 7.4 on IMDB?!?!Cringe worthy acting. Was the lady even upset when her fianc√© died? Who could tell. She was smiling and laughing the next day. Maybe she killed him.The \"humour\" is when a character tries to do a U- turn and does a 10point turn, smashing into other cars. Did anyone actually laugh at that?!A plot a 3yo could predict. Boring unlikeable protagonist. I lost quite a few brain cells watching this rubbish. Do yourself a favour a never watch it. I think the only people giving it a high rating have some nostalgia from the tv series. Even they should know better.",
    "10": "The series finale left Monk in a good place with a reassurance he had found closure and a better life with Molly being involved in his life. This movie finds Monk at his darkest and is a pale imitation of the original series. This is Monk without Sharona, Natalie, or his consulting job. If this was the best idea they could come up with, they'd have been better off leaving it alone and letting the series finale be the end. Predictable and mostly fan service with little sign of the character growth we'd seen over the course of the series. Not even as funny as the short they did during covid a few years ago.",
    "11": "When watching this all I was thinking was; why does this have to be his last case?It ends on a good positive note and his relationship with his daughter was handled perfectly and she almost set herself up to be a perfect Sharona/Natalie style sidekick for a new series run if this happened.Tony Shalhoub seems to fit the role like a glove and it doesn't feel like its been 13 years since his last episide. It just feels like it was a year or so ago he was last playing the roleIf they could offer a new series of Dexter many years later they can easily do it with Monk.All you need is to find a way to get Stottlemeyer into the fold.and you have perfect TV.",
    "12": "Mr. Monk solves another case, there is lot of nostalgia in this and Mr. Monk and his sidekicks get back together, also his psychiatrist. If you didn't like the show you won't like this, if you did it's like a solid episode, not one of the best but solid.For those unfamiliar with the show it's a who dunnit and a how did they do it type of mystery show with a quirky main character (he has severe OCD).There is plenty of humor but also there is a very serious side story line involving Mr. Monk thinking about resigning from life.The case itself wasn't that intriguing which is why I'm not giving it a 10.",
    "13": "While I always believed that the show Monk was worthy of a television movie, I was skeptical that one could be made that would be good enough for fans. The series finale was phenomenal and sometimes less is more. While on its own, I would only rate this movie a 6 or 7. It has its flaws and plot holes to be sure, but it is a solid 10 for Monk fans and after all, that is who it was made for! Off hand, I would say that they checked off all the boxes. It is near impossible to get everything you want into an hour and a half movie but it still leaves things open for another possible movie down the road.",
    "14": "I almost have no words to say about how horrible this movie was. After a hard day at work, my husband and I were excited to sit down and watch this movie filled with some laughs, some mystery and familiarity with the characters. What we watched was such a huge disappointment that I wish I could have my time back!!! Talk about a depressing downer! The whole thing was so dark when it came to mental health struggles,. Who wants to be reminded every chance they got that their favorite character is plotting to kill himself throughout the whole movie. And the stepdaughter, whose fianc√© was killed, was so ridiculously not grieving, or even upset that her fianc√© just plunged to his death was just ignorant. She was smiling and happy, and didn't even look like somebody who had lost the love of their life. The whole thing was terrible acting with a terrible plot a terrible attempt at trying to make what was really a great series into a movie. Honestly don't waste your time you'll walk away disappointed.",
    "15": "The Monk series ended brilliantly, so there is no need for a movie except as a cash grab. That said, I kept an open mind.I enjoyed it but not as much as most episodes of the series. It was better than my least favorite episode (Mr Monk and the Rapper).Tony is great. This movie is a darker than the episodes - Monk comes close to suicide. It's fun to see these characters but the episode itself is not as much fun. In fact, it's more far-fetched than even the most unbelievable episodes.The use of Monk's cliches is extremely forced and gratuitous. Trudy has aged immensely, even though she's dead and appears only in Monk's hallucinations. Why would Monk imagine her as being older than she was when she was alive?As for the crime itself, I figured it out as soon as it happened. Yes, it's that obvious. Ridiculously obvious.The ending is downright schmalzy and long. And Monk litters!Imagine going to a family reunion to catch up then you find that your relatives are all idiots and jerks. Yea.I enjoyed watching this with friends but, otherwise, wish this movie hadn't been made.It's just not very good. Watch one of the episodes (Garbage Strike, Red-headed Stranger) instead.Let's hope this really is Monk's last case.",
    "16": "Maybe I'm overwhelmed by nostalgia but Monk's last case is the perfect send-off to a beloved TV character. This movie has all the vibes down to a T, the comedy is just like it was in the TV series and I love it.I was very happy when I saw the trailer and that most of the main cast are back to reprise their roles. Tony Shalhoub still got and plays Monk so perfectly even after more than a decade, I almost forgot that I was watching an older Monk, it's amazing how he got back into it so perfectly.And not to forget Natalie, the Captain and Randy, it's like nothing changed and I loved it.I just wished we had more of Monk and the captain working together cause they had such chemistry.I love it and will watch it again and again. I'm really happy they made this movie.",
    "17": "I am a Monk fan and Tony Shalhoub didn't disappoint. He was, as always, a delight to watch. But most of the other actors were mediocre, especially McGee, whose grief was not at all convincing. Even Ted Levine was unconvincing in his conflict of interests. The story had such a great potential if each actor had tackled into it and had taken their role as seriously as Shalhoub. Except for Monk's wife, everyone seemed to be there just to create a background for Monk.I earnestly hope this is not Monk's last case, not only because I will gladly watch more of Monk any time but also because he deserves a better \"last case,\" if there has to be one.",
    "18": "For my money, two detectives on television have been enduringly iconic and the best ever: One is Peter Falk as Lt. Columbo, and the other is Tony Shalhoub as Mr. Monk. Nearly 14 years after its original 8-year-long run, we have been given a neat gift of the return of Monk to work a final case (two homicides, actually). It's not the best installment of the series (a bit sentimental for that), but it's not bad and will probably largely satisfy the hardcore audience awaiting a reprise. Little touches, like an early shoutout to Monk's first assistant, Sharona (played by Bitty Schram, who quit the series midway through Season 3), and a lovely song, Human Kindness, provided by the great Randy Newman (who had composed Monk's original theme, \"It's a Jungle Out There\")All actors portraying major characters return, including Hector Elizondo as Monk's beleagured therapist; Melora Hardin as his beloved deceased wife, Trudy; Traylor Howard as his long-time assistant, Natalie; Jason Gray-Stanford as Randy (since moved to run a small-town NJ PD); and of course, Ted Levine as Leland Stotllemeyer (also retired from the SFPD to run private security). The guest villain this time, played by Brit James Purefoy, is clearly supposed to be a version of Jeff Bezos (multibillionaire e-commerce inventor with his civilian space program, a la Blue Origin). A bit of humor: when a star-struck Randy hears Purefoy's character has \"bought The Atlantic,\" it must be explained that it's a magazine (Bezos famously owns The Washington Post), and not the ocean the character's wife goes to swim in. My rating for this reunion is 8/10, but back in the day, the best original episodes were 9/10.",
    "19": "When I saw this was a thing that would be coming out I was excited. The Psych! Movies have been great and these are the same era of television.It is slow, long and I was able to figure out the who how and why faster that the people in the movie. I was losing interest before the halfway mark. They tried overly hard to push the same old germ jokes from the series but by adding everyone in because of Covid.It has a few good laughs but after watching this I wouldn't want to see another movie or series. I am wondering if my rating is too generous and may end up lowering the rating after more time. Honestly I would like to have seen them pair Monk up with the Psych team.",
    "20": "A familiar face returns to our screens with this TV movie version of Monk. It's been 14 years since we last saw Adrian Monk on our screens (COVID special isn't canon) and the movie feels just as fresh as the TV show did. Hopefully we see more from Monk sooner rather than later and the ending leaves things open for that to happen.A subplot throughout the story is Monk's preparation for suicide. He has a plan, has been hoarding his medication and we see several allusions to his death. He even tells a dog to give up and die.In the slightly unusual ending Monk is met by Trudy who tells him she's not alone and doesn't need him to kill himself. Dozens and then hundreds of other ghosts appear as the people who've been killed but had their cases solved by Monk appear.It would have been nice to see more of the familiar Monk cameos like Sarah Silverman and Andy Richter. Hopefully Marci can make appearance in Monk 2.",
    "21": "Please create sequels for this movie. If its TV show had its own great time and, at the same time, doesn't want to 'ruin' it with a new 'refreshed' TV show, it's better to continue with movies instead. I've seen a lot of good shows that ended a long time ago, and when renewed with today's standards, it ruins the hype and greatness of the old days, contributing to low ratings, as seen with 'Frasier.' This movie should have a higher budget and recognition, similar to other Hollywood crime-solving movies like 'Knives Out' or Hercule Poirot movies such as 'Murder on the Orient Express.'The writer is already well-known and very good; the only thing missing here is an overall higher budget and a cinematic standard. Don't get me wrong-I love this movie, but it still looks like an episode of the 'Mr. Monk Show.' I hope the producer and movie makers consider these ideas and advice from a fan.",
    "22": "Judging from the reviewer reactions to what i watched AND their reactions to the few reviewers(out of, so far, 20) that criticized Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie. It seemed to me, as it went along, that people were so hyped up to see their Mr Monk that they found a mediocre script incredibly palatable...it wasn't only that it was really all that funny(and i'm being generous here), it was also that there seemed to be a lot of filler ONLY there to satisfy the fans' cravings for another fix by 'bringing back the gang' and giving them WAY too much airtime with nothing much to say that was worth hearing. From what i've seen of the show it was at LEAST a few notches above this as far as quality material goes...i'm glad that it gave the fans another fix...it's obvious that it was sorely needed...",
    "23": "Finally, someone got it right! This movie stays true to the original story and cast while giving it new life. This movie was funny, smart, and had a good emotional component.I can't be the only person who thought about Monk while over sanitizing during the Pandemic. I appreciate, the movie touching on current events like the Pandemic without making it the entire movie or into some political statement. It was nice to see entertainment actually be entertaining again.It's not often I find myself laughing out loud at a movie. If you're still deciding if you should watch this movie, watch it. Now! You won't be disappointed. The only negative, now I want more Monk.",
    "24": "Was so excited to hear of movie I had to subscribe to Peacock just to see it!! It seemed short but now I've started w season one again so i can stream all the shows one after the other.Would LOVE to see it come back I would watch them all. This show gives me an \"uplifting feel good feeling!\"\nWas so excited to see all the old gang back together again, too. They all work so great together. Their personalities really shine when they are together. The humor is perfect and they haven't lost their sparkle.Thanks for bring it back and thanks to all the actors for returning. Their life stories are great too.",
    "25": "I always loved TV show, but to be honest it wasn't because of the script writers. I thought they were always a bit shallowly informed about subjects involved in individual episodes. If Leland was in monastery it was obvious that writers never spent a day of their life in it. If it was about running a marathon they obviously didn't investigate all the instruments of checking if somebody is cheating, and especially they didn't stop to ask if someone's running record would stand in court as an alibi and so on...There was the sam problem in this movie also. Why would a guy who arranged the accident go to the bridge? If he wanted to see that everything went well, he would certainly lay low and not expose himself moments after the tragedy. Why would a guy who planned a perfect murder, write a threat note with his own hand?BTW, I knew \"what happened\" 2 minutes after it happened and I'm not a genius.So why do I love this show then? First and foremost because of Tony Shaloub. As a Monk he's excellent. I love those micro episodes about his condition, like in this move. The scene with a book publisher, the scene with delivery guy, and when he stepped in poop... I also like Randy Disher scenes and we have two excellent scenes in this move. The one at gate really made me laugh loudly. Leland was always interesting character also. The rest of the crew, I could live with or without. Harold would be nice addition two, but he was just mentioned in a farewell letter.So there you are. Whoever loved TV show, probably didn't love it for the mystery (like Poirot or Sherlock Holmes). And if you loved the show, you'll love the movie. Just go with it.",
    "26": "I truly don't understand some of the negative reviews, especially coming from people claiming to be fans of Monk. This movie was quintessential Monk. They brought back all of the main characters, and each character played their part just like they did during the show. Tony Shalhoub once again was brilliant as Monk, and looks fantastic to be 70 years old. The movie had some very funny moments as well some heart felt moments. Not only that, but I thought the ending was brilliant, and a great way to end such a good series. If you loved Monk, then don't listen to the negative reviews, because I think you will love this movie, if nothing else for the nostalgia.",
    "27": "Kept checking IMDB to see that 'Monk the movie' was actually happening because who doesn't love Monk? This is a movie, not just another episode, and should have been the biggest and the best Monk mystery. It was not. A bit of Sharona (Bitty Schram) and Shalhoub's wife (Brooke Adams) cameo and we're off to a good start with a very 'Monk' funny opening scene. Been a long time since watching the series but I don't remember a Molly? The cast we all love and know assembles: Natalie, Randy and Stottlemeyer. There are some magical Monk moments but it's all a little too contrived and schmaltzy for me. Not bad but could have been so much better.",
    "28": "When I heard that Mr. Monk is invastigating again I was at first very excited but then on second thought rather worried that the characters might be too old for a Monk worthy entertainment. I also didn't like the title very much. Unfortunately my fears about the course of the movie came true. Don't get me wrong, Tony Shalhoub hit the ball out of the ballpark, he is Mr. Monk but the rest of the crew left me rather disappointed. The story was weak and predictable and i fell asleep after half of the movie but watched the other half later just to find myself dissapointed again. Why did they make this movie? I give 3 stars because of Tony and the Covid Jokes but overall i would advise every Monk fan to avoid this movie and remember the good old Monk times.",
    "29": "I haven't watched the Monk show before. The movie did a nice job making me familiar with the characters. Unfortunately it was really dull and slow and long for me at least.I can imagine if you know the story, if you followed along with the lives of the characters for a long time, then perhaps you'll have many enjoyable moments. Speaking as someone who isn't familiar with the previous episodes - to me the current score of 7.7 is ridiculous. Not a bad movie, but not a great one by any measure.CGI is mediocre, detective work is obvious, revelations were expected, police work was sloppy.Directing, editing and main characters were nice and overall a gentle, warm, enjoyable experience.",
    "30": "I wanted to love this! I jumped out of my skin when I saw it! It is terrible. Should have made this a lot sooner.The cast is missing many sparks! Everything is always explained like it's Monk for dummies. The flashbacks don't fit. The plot is slow. The worst part of it all is Tony. I'm so sorry for saying that and I love you mucho BUT he doesn't feel like the old Monk anymore.On a more pleasant note, it was great to see everyone again. The beginning of the film moves so slowly that it ruins the entire film vibe. It's worth watching because it's Monk and he's back! Well, sort of. Xoxoxoxoxo.",
    "31": "Would have given ten stars if not for the very obvious Elon Musk vibes of a character and the case kinda being solved quickly, but it was nice to see Mr. Monk piece it together along with healing his broken spirit. Which I think could have been more original.Other than that such a sweet reunion movie. They just fell right onto step like the show never ended. The ending is very precious and I cried like a baby. The tenderness these characters and I am sure actors feel for each other is rare in shows nowadays.I don't want to give any spoilers, but the movie was touching as most of us has been in Mr. Monk's headspace at one time in our life. But there is kindness and friendship and hope out there.As a Christian that hope is Jesus. When sad days come I cling to that.",
    "32": "Monk was one of my family's favorite pastimes for many years. So when the movie was announced-a last hurrah, as it were, for Adrian Monk-I was terribly excited. It was a warm, funny, and endearing show with one of the greatest characters ever created for TV, Tony Shalhoub's Monk. It became such a huge part of my life, and this movie is a near-perfect, downright beautiful goodbye to this wonderful character and show. Tony Shalhoub's acting is also tremendous in this; he fits right back perfectly into the character we all love. Honestly, the movie is quite emotional and really gives you all the feels and then some. Tony Shalhoub, come Emmy season, should be a serious consideration because of his stupendous, highly endearing performance. He was so good in this that I didn't even care about the case; he was enough for me. You could see the pain in his eyes in every scene, and hope dwindling at every turn, but the ending is inherently satisfying and perfect. Fans of the show and the character will be extremely satisfied - it was great to see Adrian Monk do his thing one last time.",
    "33": "I was scared going into this, reunion movies are always a bad idea. But this was great. I have my minor critiques as a diehard fan of the show, but this was great. I loved the minor details that made me feel like was watching the show. The font for the opening credits, the end credits using the theme song, the humor, the cinematography, references, everything. Sometimes reunion films are just a slapped together cash grab, sometimes horribly different from the original content. But this actually felt like an addition to the original show canon. Andy Breckmen and Randy Zisk being behind it I think was critical to this. And I love that the door for a sequel or reboot was left open!",
    "34": "Here is what happened. He's the guy. The grey flashbacks are nostalgic. The billion dollar answer is why we choose to proceed.The ocd scenes were obvious and tedious and not funny. The choice to have a character struggle with suicide could get into some conspiracy theories about medication but this film is classic Monk for a tv series from the early 2000s. The CGI is subtle enough but it was great to see characters reprise their roll.Leaves one asking for more but I can see the series living on with Molly. Although they never explained how she's Trudy's daughter. Left me with more questions that closure.",
    "35": "And as fast as it came, there goes the last we will ever see of Monk *sobs uncontrollably*. As much as I love that we got another taste of the Defective Detective, this brings back the heartache of the show ending all over again.But atleast we got some more laughs, some more Adrian, and more of the crew.Just wish Sharona was in the movie, and also they never mentioned what happened to Ambrose Monk. Adrian keeps saying he's alone, but he always had his brother.I guess I will now have to go back and rewatch the entire show again. For the sixth time. Because as good as the movie is, it doesn't have the same magic as the show.",
    "36": "In an era where additions to series have become commonplace this movie stands out in a very important way. This movie does not feel the need to ruin the protagonist. The directing, the editing, the acting feels all very much like the original Monk. It all feels very much like either a proper ending or a new beginning for Adrian. Sure, the character struggles with feelings associated with aging, irrelevance, depression, and questions of any legacy or purpose; but instead of introducing a new protagonist who proves those feelings true, this movie actually honor Monk's achievements. It is nice to see a continuation which doesn't try to usurp the role by degrading the original.",
    "37": "This was great!!! It truly made me happy to see the old gang back together and it seems like the old writers came back as well! I am usually against reboots but this one looks promising, if that's what they're going for. The characters, writing, and scoring all held up. I would love to see everyone come back. But I don't see how that would happen. However, it did seem like they were setting up new characters. Monk is such a loveable character. And the original show never jumped the shark, which is a big advantage for continuing the series. I love the subtle Watson and Holmes reference as well.",
    "38": "This is my first exposure to the obsessive-compulsive detective. Like Colombo, you know who the killer is, and the fun is discovering how the detective proves it. While I loved Peter Falk asking questions posed by his boss or wife (wink-wink) I found Tony Shalhoub's composure to be annoying and irritating, especially with him seeing dead people. Hey, just ask them who did it. Monk is retired and attempts to solve a non-case of the death of Griffen (Austin Scott) who was to marry Monk's step-daughter Molly (Caitlin McGee). His suspect is Rick Eden (James Purefoy) who owns an Amazon like company. Griffen had accused Eden of murdering his former partner.Having not seen the Monk series before I failed to grasp any old jokes or connections. I had the case figured out an hour before Monk. Not good.",
    "39": "I watched every episode of Monk when they originally aired, and I have been rewatching key episodes in the past two months. A lot of reboots recently have not captured the magic of the original for various reasons, so I was afraid this would be another one that ruins the original premise. Turns out I had nothing to worry about. Monk returns right into form and manages to be the same old Monk in a new world.Somehow they managed to capture all the essence of the show. Every episode was either a whodunnit or a \"howdunnit\", and this was the latter, true to formula. All the little quirks of each character came through. They gave us little throwbacks to the original show (The Randy Disher Project, my personal favorite--Harold Krenshaw). But it wasn't all fun because we had some very serious and moving moments.I would love to see a whole new set of movies come out after watching this one!",
    "40": "I can't stop smiling and l'm so overwhelmed about the end. Thank you so much for this wonderful lovely hommage to Monk\nAnd l was feeling that Monk was never away, was feeling like l watched 'yesterday, the last episode from Monk\nAll the references, and that Sharona now is a grandmother\nYou could see how all actors loved to come back and everyone was in ,his/her' old elements\nBut the ending: where are you? I'm still in the freezer ....OMG\nMonks smiling at the end with all his solved cases/victims\nI know l wouldn't be disappointed\nI have now hope that it wasn't the last time we've seen Monk and his family again.I'll rewatch as often l rewatch the serie.",
    "41": "Really didn't expect a lot from yet another reboot/rehash (especially after my review slamming the awful Frasier 2.0).But unlike with Dr. Crane, Mr. Monk's reemergence stayed within his character - and was surrounded by familiar characters (who were fun to see). The mass overreaction to Covid was alluded to, but if anything, not played up enough (Adrian would still be triple masked - we'll thank him later).Nice to see the wonderful Melora Hardin and Traylor Howard (who apparently hasn't acted for years) aging gracefully and minimally, without counterproductive face-changing measures. Stottlemeyer's delayed entrance after the Randy Disher Project prank was great. Disher, Dr. Bell - the gang's (almost) all here! (No Sharona, which was explained, but I WAS hoping for an appearance by Harold Crenshaw).The show felt too long - the chase scene dragged. And the $1 Billion offer was ridiculous - the opposite of Dr. Evil's pathetic One MILLION Dollars demand. In fact, the whole story line was pretty weak.But no matter - the stories ALWAYS were pretty out there - the ending was touching and Tony Shalhoub was temendous in his return!",
    "42": "Some narratives are better left without further elaboration. Why search for a conclusive episode where none is needed? This film is an utter waste of time and resources, raising significant concerns about its negative impact on the environment. The evident disregard for generating significant content suggests that movies of such inferior quality should potentially face repercussions for fostering an unparalleled level of senselessness. It also serves as a wake-up call, urging viewers to become more aware of the need for environmental stewardship.In addition to the environmental concerns, the disappointing performances of some actors in the film contribute to a diminished appreciation of their talents. Their lackluster portrayal in a project that already lacks merit only serves to exacerbate the film's overall shortcomings.",
    "43": "I love the original series but did not expect this to be as good because most mew remakes are not as good as the original and the cast is older but this kept me interested the whole time. It was like watching an episode of the tv show. Even though it was longer than a normal episode the time flew by. It had a perfect mix of suspense and comedy. They did a good job of not being extremely predictable like a lot of todays shows and kept you guessing how the case would be solved and what would happen next. They did a good job as well of incorporating old and new characters into the movie. This movie is perfect for all ages.",
    "44": "The movie was enjoyable and humorous, except for Randy's conspiracy theory about the lowered bridge, which felt underdeveloped. It would have been better if they had crafted a more compelling subplot or used the time more effectively. The rest felt like watching another episode, and overall, I'm hopeful for a new series after 13 years since the last episode. The movie could serve as a pilot for a continuation, and Monk's last case shouldn't be the conclusion; there are many more mysteries to solve. Imagining Leland, Randy, and Natalie forming a detective agency in New York with Monk residing on the 100th floor of a skyscraper adds an interesting twist to the potential future series.",
    "45": "I missed issues of Monk for the last years, and was eager to watch this rebirth. I was disappointed at scenes which were prolonged long past necessary. I thought the plot was fascinating. I'm disappointed that Mr. Monk did not come to think that if someone broke into The victims room and did not take anything, then the obvious thought is that he must've left something. Since the victim measured the bungee cord himself, and measured again, and no one else touched the cord, he must have measured wrong. And the simplest explanation, which became obvious early in the show was that he measured with a faulty measuring tape, which was put in by a henchman of the evil Mogul, who was an interesting mashup of Elon Musk, and, Jeff Bezos.",
    "46": "The movie was more or less what I expected. Very close to the atmosphere of the original series, which was very nice.I was happy to see all the actors doing well. Enjoyed the film, although I 'd say it was more of a long Monk episode, rather than a film.Kind of wish they would bring the series back and do a whole season or two... Based on the film, I think that it would go well.I did miss Sharona, even if it was more of a cameo. Also, didn't enjoy Trudy appearing as a ghost. Don't think it helped the story much, they could do without that.In total it was enjoyable. If you were a fan of the original series, it does worth your time. If not, then move along.",
    "47": "Everyone involved in this project should be very proud of themselves. As a longtime fan of Monk, the series, I could not have asked for a better story to cap off the defective detective's tremendous tale. I laughed. I cried. It was cathartic seeing old faces return and good to know how other favorites were doing off-screen. The film is a love letter to Monk and also to the fans for their loyalty. Not a beat was missed. Every joke lands while still delivering those emotional moments from Monk that resonate the core message of the character: Love conquers fear. It truly is a jungle out there, and we can all learn a lot about courage from the characters. I definitely recommend this film and the series that came before. You'll thank me later.",
    "48": "I have never actually taken the time to write a review for the beloved TV series \"Monk\" but considering it is my favorite show of all time, I thought it would be appropriate to review this Peacock original movie.I waited for this for months, and I can honestly say that it was everything that I had hoped it would be, and more! The cast still looks phenomenal, and how about Traylor Howard (Natalie Teeger); can you say \"stunner\"?? I only wish that some more of the cast had been able to return for this finale (ie. Sharona, Benjy, Julie, TK, etc). I was slightly disappointed with the suicide theme playing the part of the back-story for this episode, but I'm very willing to overlook it. For what it's worth, I don't believe Monk would ever actually have followed through with such an act if his intention was to see Trudy again, based upon my very own beliefs.I truly hope everyone enjoys this as much I did! Monk was an important part of my childhood! We tuned in every week in the 2000s when the series originally aired. How hard it is to believe that it has been 14 years already.My only wish is that we could have more. Peacock, is there a chance that this \"Last Case\" could actually be the beginning of a fresh start for the franchise? Pretty please! Maybe I'm getting my hopes up, but, regardless, I'm happy with this ending if that is what it's to be! I'll be high on this episode for weeks to come.My sincere thanks to Peacock!!",
    "49": "I'm a die-hard Monk fan and eagerly awaited this movie. However, I was disappointed to see the depressive turn the writers took with Monk's character. As another reviewer wrote, I too would have loved to see Monk embracing how the world dealt with germs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr. Monk gleefully witnessing the world wearing masks, using sanitizers amd wipes would have been hilarious. It seemed as if the writers weren't aware of the subtle nuances that make Monk \"Monk\". All in all, It was an enjoyable hour and a half. I loved seeing the old crew back together but it definitely missed its mark.",
    "50": "After watching Disney and a bunch of other production companies tank movie after movie I had lost all hope of seeing a good movie getting released. Monk was authentic to the beautiful series that preceeded it. Despite the length of time that's passed since the series each and every actor played their character perfectly. None seemed out of practice as you might expect after so long since the series. Monk was still the troubled nervous investigator who's dry humor brought a smile with every joke. That's another thing the writers did an amazing job. They did not compromise the film in an effort to modernize it or add political jokes to only fall flat. Thank you for such a wonderfully refreshing film. Thank you to the cast for creating a master piece among all the garbage being released around you. You all did not disappoint.",
    "51": "Well, I hope this won't be the last case for Adrian Monk. It's been so long since the series ended and it was a sheer joy to see the whole gang back together again.Tony Shalhoub is such an underrated actor. He pitches everything just right and it's as if he has never been away for so long. He retains the quirkyness, the awkwardness and some great humour.The plot is good, James Purefoy makes a good baddie and the supporting gang all do a great job. Jason Gray-Stanford (Disher) chips in with some hilarious attempts to solve the case, too.So while i understand that Shalhoub might not want to get involved with another Monk series, I do hope he'll agree to do the occasional movie.",
    "52": "It's Monk. Tony Shalhoub, returning to (for me) his greatest role. One can only hope this restarts a new series because this was just as much heartfelt fun as the Monk of old. I'm so glad this just felt like a feature length episode because that was all it needed to be, to just let the characters shine. It was great to see the some of the best supporting characters return as well but most of all it is watching Tony Shalhoub do his thing as Monk that is the very comfort food of great television. I also really enjoyed the digs at Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Sit back on a lazy Sunday afternoon and let this little gem wash away your woes.",
    "53": "Just like original Monk cases this movie had the same feel. Like something you didn't know you needed. Feeling like old times it was great. You find yourself loving the characters all over again. At the beginning of the show you are told who the killer and you find yourself turning deceive to help Mr. Monk prove he's right. What I missed was the feeling that this was difficult. I needed to feel the intrigue and the mystery. What you get is the love we have always felt for Mr. Monk and just a classic extended Monk episode. I did miss Sharona. I also hope there is another. So if you're looking for a throwback to classic Monk this will fill that need.",
    "54": "Great movie. Ending was great. Would love to see a reboot of the series with his step daughter. I know maybe not the whole original cast. Alot of true feelings about post Covid issues. I do recommend this movie. I could see more episodes regarding new technology vs Mr. Monk. Was hoping to see Crenshaw. Movie was great going to watch it like 50 plus times. I'm a big fan. My parents never watched it. I think it's better than Law and Order. Hopefully a reboot. If not a second and fourth movie. It was good to see all of them again. I hope we see a reboot or more movies. This was the best show on tv. This is more family friendly. I have some ideas for a show.",
    "55": "This movie is one long love letter to the show \"Monk\" and Adrian Monk! It's a great movie for lovers of the show, but would totally understand if seen as \"corny\" and \"much\" by non-viewers of the original series! There are so many little tropes and lines dug in the script, that I highly suggest FINISHING the series before viewing. The acting by Shaloub as always, is top notch. You could tell that he enjoys the characters and brining new life to Adrian again. I don't know about any of you other Monk fans but, I was also wondering in 2020 \"How is Monk doing?\" Obviously he's just a character in a sit-com show, but we really did all become Monk for a short period of time. This was the perfect time to bring this story back and bring it to a close!",
    "56": "Big Monk fan here so I was excited to see a movie being released. I did think the tv series was better, but when it comes to things like this where they try to pick up a decade or more later for a redo or new ending, it's usually not as good at the original. (I felt same about the Dexter series even though that one did need a better ending). I didn't like the way an Elon Musk / Jeff Bezos combo imitation business was included in the plot - the tv show rarely had anything relating to current people, events, or businesses (Hugh Hefner is the only one that really sticks out from the series). The movie lacked on the original music which contributed a lot to the show's entertainment value. I was really hoping Sharona would make some small appearance, but she was only mentioned briefly by Randy. I cried more than laughed for this one. I'm glad they were able to get the main cast back together though. I will probably watch it again just to see if I catch something I missed the first time.",
    "57": "When I heard this year that they were making a movie, I got so excited. I was a Monk fan since childhood and i sometimes rewatched the show as an adult just for the old times sake and now the movie was so nice to enjoy. :)\nIt was funny and sad and emotional, it was all of that and more. We can definetely say after all this time it's good they got together and made the movie.Seeing them all together was cool and James Purefoy was definetely an awesome additon, he has such an unique charm to his appearances. He added value to the movie.No spoilers so as a fan, just enjoy it guys. It was probably the last of monk and the crew we got to see. :)",
    "58": "I don't know who decided to make a Monk movie with little humor and no charm. They brought back Natalie, Randy, and The Captain to barely interact with Monk. Randy who is supposed to be a Sheriff is still portrayed as a goof. Molly who was a blonde in the series finale is not brunette.Even the Monk quirks are mostly ignored to show a dour hallucinating Monk opining to Trudy about killing himself. The title itself doesn't make sense. It's not his final case, as he is retired and is doing a favor for Molly. And he decides to go back to investigating in the end. The villain is just a generic rich bad guy and a waste of James Purefoy. If you wanted a little of the series back, I don't think you'll find your fix with this thud.",
    "59": "I am so impressed with the writers and directors decision to make this movie. I was please to see that they included so many of the original actors. I loved that the storyline was very creative and I loved revisiting all of the characters that were included in the film. I think that Monk would still bring in audiences from TV viewers if the writers from the film decided to bring Monk back to the small screen. I personally I would absolutely love it if a follow-up TV Series was created. I do think that there was really any advertising done for this film which I see as a sad mistake on the part of those that made this film. In my opinion even with it's quiet simplicity the storyline was more entertaining than many other films showcased this year. So I am asking the powers that be to PLEASE offer a A FOLLOW-UP SERIES.... PLEASE! DT.",
    "60": "IF YOURE A REAL FAN OF MONK you would know this stayed 100% true to the show. It was perfection from start to finish. It made me laugh and also made me emotional. It was BEAUTIFUL. And everyone back at it together? And older Leland still handsome!I have no idea what negative reviews are about and I rarely leave reviews but it Bothers me that there is anything below a 9/10... as someone who's rewatched all of Monk COUNTLESS times.The movie was absolutely touching. It felt kind of like a season finale episode with a few crazy adventures. I am in awe of the great writing and acting from everyone... it's like it never ended. I don't think they'll make another movie sequel but it makes sense not to. Watch it.",
    "61": "Ima die hard monk fan. My all time favorite show. Broke my heart when it ended. But this film was a birthday blessing and I could never be more thankful for a bday gift! I loved it! It had all the right cast and mention of sharona! And followed the same theme as the original show! Well done! My only complaint is not long enough! Please bring my monk back as a show! Revamping shows is in. All except Mr. Monk. Ill even subscribe to peacock if you do! I hope everyone enjoyed this as much as i did so we can get more monk back in our lives! The worlds changed a lot since 08! Lets go monk fanatics!!",
    "62": "I thought I would have to rewatch the whole series to remember references, but I didn't have to! It was so well made and captures an incredible and heartwarming story! Watching this transported me back in time to watching the show. I feel like the mental health theme was covered well and will help inform people of what suicide can look like. I was curious how they were going to incorporate Monk's quirks in the show, but using the Covid twist was a perfect way to start it! I didn't plan to cry as much as I did watching this, but I did! You'll need a fresh box of Kleenex to watch this movie! You won't regret it!",
    "63": "Pros the cast is great in their roles.Cons everything else, the story is the same predictable formulaic crime drama we came to be tired of with the tv show and the final solution is idiotic. The tape measurer was swapped for one that measured a fraction of a millimeter longer? I enjoyed the tv show for the first few seasons but it got to the point where every episode was the same and this sadly continues the trend of lazy writing. Add in the continuity errors and this really sets a sad tone for what was occasionally an entertaining show. I had hoped that this would break the Hollywood trend of everything absolutely has to have a happy ending but sadly it's not and I think we can expect more monk in the future.",
    "64": "This movie was seriously amazing. It fully recaptured everything that made the show great. It was possibly the hardest I ever laughed at Monk. The humor was on point. I saw several complaints about the mystery being \"too obvious\" but I don't see that being an issue. Many of the episodes of the series gave away who commited the crime early on and it was more of \"how\" than \"who\". It was amazing seeing all of the cast together again. The story was emotional, funny, and really nostalgic. It brought back the feeling of the original series in a great way, which is all I could really ask. I'm giving it the same score as I gave the show because I feel it is every bit as good as I could've expected.",
    "65": "I'm literally in tears. It was beautiful and funny and just overall amazing. It was good to see everyone and some new faces. I loved the honesty and humanity of it all. People still struggle and it was handled with care and not criticism or judgement. Will definitely watch again as well as re-watch my favorite episodes from the show. Also loved the nod at the ending with all the people he helped solved the cases of and how it was portrayed. With the spirits walking by his side and being there for him when he really needed someone. Or in this case several someone's. Thanks for the re-boot, laughs, tears and love. Love you Monkey!",
    "66": "It was great. I'm hopeful that it's the prelude for a return of the series-or at least, some made-for-tv movies. Adrian Monk is a great character, humanizing the obstacles faced by those suffering mental illness. Shaloub has done a great job of creating a memorable character. While the series is a mystery series, it has always had comic overtones. It would have been easy to create a caricature. Early episodes of the series were not as sensitive as they could have been, but they got better as the series progressed. I am hopeful that I see signs of plans to resurrect the series, with Monk accompanied by his faithful assistant \"Watson.\"",
    "67": "I soo wanted to like this movie. I was a huge fan of Mr. Monk, and I used to enjoy the show immensely. The fact that we can have a quirky hero with OCD was intriguing and I was rooting for another season.But, if we can't have the show returning, a TV movie is great, right?Well, it could have been, but this has got to be the most lazy writing ever done for a movie.Mr. Monk isn't quirky, he's just awkward.He's not allowed to be clever and use his intelligence, because the case is so clumsy presented, that we all know who done it and how immediately.That means, the entire movie we're just waiting for Monk to catch up on what we already know, because no one made the effort of making an interesting case.Great to see all the belowed characters again, but man - I'm rage-writing this review because it's probably the only time the cast gets back together, and then they get a script written by a 10 year old.",
    "68": "When I saw Randy Zisk was directing, Andy Breckman was writing, and everyone was coming back, the pit in my stomach kept churning: \"Please don't let this be a TV movie reunion cash-grab.\" It wasn't. In fact, \"Mr. Monk's Last Case\" makes me sincerely hope it's not his last case.Everyone is back and it simultaneously feels like just yesterday when the last episode aired, and yet a whole era has passed. They don't shy away from COVID and how it affected Mr. Monk- in fact, they go deep. I wasn't expecting so much trauma to be revealed, and the even-deeper humanity it was treated with. The call to action at the end felt earned. Tony Shalhoub is hopefully in for another Emmy for bringing Mr. Monk back. And Hector Elizondo as Dr. Bell brought an unexpectedThe mystery (and the \"Here's what happened...\") will NOT disappoint. This was written and directed by people who love Monk, and it shows. Andy Breckman is TV mystery royalty, and let's everyone know it.Jeff Beal's score was one of my favorite parts of this- the \"Monk\" cues are there, but it's a new score now and not just a rehash of the original show soundtrack. His use of string instruments not only well up tears effectively, but he even brings in some Hitchcockian ethers that just hit the spot.I hope \"Mr. Monk's Last Case\" gets the recognition it deserves. It's a Monk mystery that ends up having so much more to say about Mr. Monk himself and our world today. Emphasizing just how emotional and realistic this movie got for me any further would include spoilers, so just make sure to keep some wipes handy.",
    "69": "The good: Tony Shalhoub's acting performance is great. As ever I must say, because this actor has got a special talent for playing characters who are \"masterful\" at fumbling things up, making a fool out of themselves, in such an endearing way that I can only sympathize with his characters. And this movie aint no different, although it looks and feels more like a television pilot than a real movie, which brings me to the bad...The bad: this movies' other actors are quite mediocre. And unfortunately they do get a lot of screentime and dialogue. It almost seems as if Tony Shalhoub got all the great lines and the other characters got only \"filler\" dialogue. The scenes with Tony Shalhoub were a delight to watch, but the many other scenes kinda bored me to be honest.Not terrible for certain, but not great either. It'll do as a nice pastime for those who are into slowburing, quirky, gentle detective stories.The story: Tony Shalhoub plays a neurotic detective, who visits his shrink frequently and who has got many kinds of fears. Despite all these hilariously looking shortcomings and witty scenes about his anxious outlook on his personal life he has to solve a murder case. Will he succeed or run back to his shrink asking for more pills and understanding?",
    "70": "Adrian Monk's long-awaited return sputters in \"Mr. Monk's Last Case,\" a movie that feels like a reheated episode of its origin show. The surrounding performances are bland, the plot predictable, and the atmosphere surprisingly sterile. The mystery itself is lacking the intricate twists and turns that once kept viewers glued. Monk's signature deductions feel phoned-in, and the supporting characters, including a thinly veiled Jeff Bezos parody, fail to spark any interest. Jokes fall flat, and the pacing plods along like a forgotten Tuesday night rerun.Visually, the film lacks the grit and charm of the original series, opting for a bland, made-for-TV aesthetic. While die-hard fans might find a shred of nostalgia in Shalhoub's iconic portrayal, \"Mr. Monk's Last Case\" ultimately feels like a missed opportunity. It's a pale shadow of its former self, leaving viewers yearning for the days when Monk's neuroses were genuinely thrilling, not just tired tropes.Overall, this was a disappointing reunion that fails to recapture the magic of the original series. Watch only if you're desperate for a Monk fix, and be prepared for a case of deja vu.Rating: 5-/10 (bellow average, not recommended)",
    "71": "While one review here says that nostalgia is causing people to overrate this TV movie, I'm inclined to think that it's making people underrating it, because they're forgetting that, as funny and brilliant as the show could be, and as great as Tony Shalhoub was, the series always flawed and towards the end could be genuinely bad.In the movie, Monk, an brilliant ex-detective with diagnostically fuzzy OCD is at the end of his always short rope. But when murder happens close to home (I really hate \"this time it's personal\" plot lines, but what can you do?) Monk comes out of retirement for what he's determined to be one last time.As always, Monk unsteadily treads the line between character-driven comedy and cartoonish laughs. Monk sometimes responds as someone trapped in a world of obsessions, and sometimes just acts like a weird two-year-old having a freak-out.In short, the movie, like the series is sometimes smart, and sometimes irretrievably dumb.The mystery itself is decent though unexception - I figured it out way before Monk. The returning characters are decent although underutilized (except Randy, who is overutilized). The new characters are bland and add nothing, which is unfortunate.Shalhoub, though, is still great, and his dry, anguished weirdness is still funny, even if it is the same shtick he's always done.If you're expecting more than an overlong episode of the series then you'll be disappointed, but if you just want to see one more episode of Monk, this is worthwhile.",
    "72": "The plot is a fairly standard fare for a Monk mystery. The gang comes together for the wedding of Monk's step-daughter (Trudy's daughter) who Monk befriended in the original series finale. There's just a bit of exposition to introduce the uninitiated to who the cast is and their relationship to each other. Then we're off to the races. Every Monk trope is here - the wipes, the phobias, and the cleaning.The problem is that the story is a standard Monk mystery that's for a one-hour show stretched into a 90-mintue movie. So there is filler - lots and lots of filler - so it drags in places.Given all that - the \"here's what happened\" moment is extremely satisfying, and the denouement is the sweetest moment possible. And the post-denouement is even sweeter.Not saying anything more to avoid spoilers. If you're a Monk fan, this is a must-watch. If you're not, you might want to watch a few Monk episodes first.",
    "73": "I haven't watched the show. I understand it's one of those shows with a cult following and it seems like the creators of this movie not only understood it as well, but exploited it to the fullest because the movie, on its own, is weak and borderline a waste of time. I liked Monk's character and backstory, and the ending was emotional and well done, but that's about it.For one, the antagonist is an absolute idiot. And I don't mean it as an offense, but as a fact. He's just, simply, stupid. He does stupid things in a stupid way with stupid motivation and an utterly stupid plan. An idiot. And the creators seem to think the audience is, as well. Why else would they have a perp randomly give the crucial hint about the murder right after the murder, at the place of the murder, the thing nobody could possibly know at the time, and say it completely unnecessarily and unwarranted? Why else would they have the villain send the threatening letters written by hand, touched with his own hands and with his saliva on the envelope in a time where fingerprints and DNA are usable in crime investigations? Why? This makes me so angry, seriously üòíAlso, it is said that if the audience knows who did it, at least the \"how\" should remain a mistery. The thing is, even the \"how\" is super obvious from the start. To everyone, apparently, but the brilliant detective and his entourage of useless, obviously-only-there-to-cash-in-on-nostalgia side characters. I'm not saying the characters aren't likeable or occasionally funny even, but they're completey irrelevant to anything that's happening.Ah, I know I might be unnecessarily upset, but I'm angry at myself for thinking a high grade reflects the quality :(Also, Monk's condition occasionally seems to only be there to make fun of it? Like when he brought his own sanitizer machine to the court room and then didn't allow anyone else to use it. Why not just bring sanitizer in a bottle? *sigh*",

I have not figured out how monks wife's daughter is in the show and how she had a daughter that I don't remember hearing about before even though I've watched every episode repeatedly. I really hope that this show will come back and be a regular at least quarterly although I would watch a daily! Vasquez 25 this is a great show. It's an intelligent show!

    "77": "The cinematic adaptation of the beloved television series \"Monk\" was a journey filled with mixed emotions. The nostalgic wave that washes over the audience is undoubtedly the film's strongest suit, as it revisits a familiar world and characters that once graced our screens. However, beyond this sentimental journey, the film struggles to find its footing and deliver an experience that lives up to the legacy of the original series.One of the glaring issues lies in the portrayal of the iconic characters. While they make an appearance, their presence is not substantial enough, and certainly not in the manner we had grown accustomed to. The essence of each character appears diluted, lacking the depth and nuances that made them so beloved in the first place. This deviation from the established character dynamics leaves me yearning for the authenticity that once defined the series.The screenplay, unfortunately, feels hastily crafted, riddled with inconsistencies and unexplained plot holes. The central idea attempts to take a darker turn, yet it seems as if the participants in the narrative are oblivious to this shift. The disconnect between the intended tone and the characters' reactions creates a jarring experience for the audience. The storytelling lacks finesse, leaving viewers grappling with a plot that fails to engage or deliver the mystery that was once the hallmark of \"Monk.\"The central narrative, regrettably, lacks the intrigue and suspense that characterized the original series. The plot unfolds without a compelling mystery to solve, and the storyline fails to captivate the audience's attention. It becomes apparent that the filmmakers may have underestimated the importance of a gripping storyline in a mystery genre, relying too heavily on the established fan base and the nostalgia factor.Amidst these drawbacks, there are fleeting moments of redemption. The scenes where the protagonist, Monk, momentarily reminds us of the quirks and idiosyncrasies that defined his character manage to evoke a sense of familiarity and nostalgia. Unfortunately, these moments are too sparse, and they serve as mere glimpses into what could have been a more successful adaptation.In conclusion, \"Monk's Last Case\" struggles to rise above its nostalgic appeal. While it attempts to recapture the essence of the beloved series, the lackluster portrayal of characters, a poorly developed screenplay, and a lack of a compelling mystery result in a film that falls short of expectations. Nostalgia alone cannot carry a film, and in this case, it becomes painfully evident that a more thoughtful approach to character development and storytelling was needed to do justice to the legacy of \"Monk.\"",
    "78": "Original Monk series was really great. And the final episode was terrific send-off. Bitter-sweet one.Also, creators were able to create such great, cosy, atmosphere.Episodes had a nice story flow.This movie is unfortunately nothing like that. It seems like a forced reunion. Opportunity to bring each of key starts and show them in front of the camera, trying to forcefully create nostalgia.But, it doesn't really work. Story is week, forced and there is no real detective work that was always an anchor in the series.It was a let down. Sugary execution that tried more than anything to forcefully make you feel nostalgic.It only succeeds putting you down the memory lane of the best moments in the original series.",
    "79": "Monk series have a special connection with me since I got my son to watch it with me (rewatch for me) when he was 13 (now 17).The show was great for those who have a strong nostalgia connection with the series, and \"okay-good\" for those wanting to see a mystery/detective show.Though there is lots of fan fare in the show, no Sharona and Molly is a different actress.The main reason for the 7/10 was due to the lack of crime solving, it just wasn't worthy to be a full fledge movie. How it was \"solved\" really seemed like a throwaway moment to end the movie versus him \"accidentally\" figuring it out due to continuous investigation and he just needed that one piece to connect it all.Lastly, the way to movie \"catches\" the criminal is one of those Monk episodes where you put your \"couch lawyer hat on\" and bring up certain arguments that may get your client off the hook easily because the evidence is very flimsy at best.Enjoyed the film as a fan, but if I was a person who just stumbled up a detective movie to watch, this was definitely a \"so-so\" that would not make me interested enough in seeing the series. Which such as a fan, because we (fans) know how great a show this is.",
    "80": "I am an admitted huge fan of the original tv show. I was excited to see the movie, but if my childhood taught me anything it is that movies from tv shows and movie sequels may at best be enjoyable, but will never come close to the original. This movie was the exception. And no one is more surprised than I. The writing is absolutely brilliant. It sticks tightly to the tv show in tone, premise, and flow. But, the jokes and story are taken to another level.I found the most impressive thing was that our beloved characters were not added without a need. Randy, Stottlemeyer, Dr Bell, Natalie and Molly were added only when needed for the sake of the story. Character updates were also minimal. What have Julie, Sharona, Benji, TK and more been up to? Your guess is as good as mine. I would have loved to have a wrap up on these characters! But, it would have been to the detriment to my enjoyment of the movie/episode.True to Monk, our family sat together and watched it on the 10th, as we knew Monk preferred 10 over 8. Thank you to all involved for this gift.",
    "81": "I have seen every Monk episode 3 or 4 times. I related to the show in many ways. Whether it was Monks OCD or the joy that others found in him and his abilities, and even the brotherhood of the Police.As someone that struggles with daily, medicated suicidal thoughts, I had to turn off this movie midway. I don't think the creators of this movie should have avoided the topic, but I do wish that they showed the topic more respect. If you're going to address suicide, realize that most suicidal people will not make it through this movie to see a happy ending.This movie has genuinely funny moments.The TV show was successful on the back of OCD, and while it was a little inflated for effect... it was interesting. Suicide is a major issue today and not be represented as an acceptable way out when you are out of work, your friends have left you or when you let someone down. I don't care if Monk finds happiness in the end (I assume)... this movie is an hour of suicide justification.",
    "82": "I have watched all of Monk's episode and was a huge fan, I loved the ending to the show so, so much that I was fully satisfied with it not coming back.Although, I have to admit, I was hoping for a movie (Psych did it, so why not Monk?)\nAnd the movie was basically an extended episode of Monk.I liked the story and the old characters, perhaps they could have added some well-known faces there as well. I couldn't rate it a 10 because there was something missing, not sure what exactly....but it was a terrific watch and I highly recommend it to all the Monk fans.What I disliked the most was that the changed the actress who played Molly, I understand that she had prior commitments, but they should have used somebody who, at least, had blonde hair and a somewhat looked like the previous one, didn't much care for her....which is a shame.",
    "83": "For those saying Monk acts like a cartoonish two year old- you are missing the point of the show. I am a therapist who also suffers from OCD so I have personal and professional knowledge in mental health diagnosis. Usually I hate portrayal of mental health diagnosis in television and movies because it's portrayed inaccurately and mostly does more harm than good in stigma. However, Monk is one of the only exceptions. Monk walks the line of making fun of a disease that takes the joy out of most things without mocking it. Besides some exaggerations (which is to be expected in a TV show); Monk is mostly accurate in its representation. OCD is multifaceted- there's 4 types that present differently for each person (Monk displays all 4 types). I couldn't be more different than Monk yet somehow, felt understood. It made conversations about OCD easier to have with my family and friends. I was able to show them things I felt that I found hard to explain myself. Sometimes the intrusive and repetitive thoughts can be so loud it is hard to concentrate on anything else. This explains why Monk displays erratic, selfish and sometimes, annoying behavior (much like a 2 year old).If you understand this show, if you love, miss and wish it was on for more seasons- this movie is for you. If not, skip it.P. S- while Psych and Monk have some overlapping features, they are different shows and should be treated as such. If you like the Psych movies/ show that doesn't mean you'll like Monk and vice versa. To compare them is a disservice to both shows.",
    "84": "\"Here's The Thing\", This movie was so great in many ways, and thanks to all the producers, writers and actors involved. \"It is great to be back together again\" Natalie says near the end, with so many thoughtful and fun references to the series, and as Tony Shaloub references in an interview about making the movie, they also \"expanded\" the depth of the story. As in the series, there are serious issues addressed, yet, allowing us to laugh at ourselves, our inability to control what we cannot control, and in the end, have an empathy for others, and still have some fun despite the challenges we face.Reading about the backgrounds here at IMDb about many of those involved with the show, their history in the theater be it drama, musicals and/or comedy, I wonder if \"expanding\" the stories would also include, as was done in the series, and in many of the great tv series of recent years, utilizing stories that can reach a popular audience, yet have something significant to say, and learn from, while at the same time fostering talent at the local theater level, and in a sense, cultivate the local theater and arts scene in those places also, giving them a chance to thrive, as many have been struggling since covid, and the greater, beneficial affect on society as a whole when we have great public theater and arts. Thank you to all involved.",
    "85": "Blown away! Great watch and even more important subject!!Mr Monk on mental health and this Covid era is genius! Bring the show back!Truly a gift for every monk fan, watcher or admirer.I would love an update on all the characters in depth through a series, but for a movie it was perfect.Was so happy to see everyone it felt like a family reunion.Anyway to get a series back? This show needs to be back on and I'm happy they finally made a movie. Another movie as well?10/10 You won't be disappointed. Some of the jokes from some of supporting cast was a lil cheesy but that's how we like it!",
    "86": "My thoughts on this subject:\nFirst: If you need help with suicidal thoughts - call 988.Second: Suicide is a choice. I saw the effect of someone's suicide on family and friends. Because of that, I CHOOSE NEVER TO COMMIT SUICIDE because I did not want to hurt anyone by doing that. It really works if you think more of what it will do to other people.Third: You are valuable to people and have done wonderful things for them. Even if it is just listening.Forth: Ask for help: There is nothing wrong with that. Not one damn thing.Fifth: Get a pet. Dog, cat, fish, gopher. It does not matter. Any of these will do.Good luck and Remember - 988."
