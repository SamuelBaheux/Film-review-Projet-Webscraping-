    "0": "Frankly speaking never liked Zoya Akhtar. She is really overrated. She copies everything and makes it worse. Coming back to Archies, calling it a movie is pure waste of my breathe. Actors are pathetic, there is no story. Same old cliches. Super rich trying to understand Poor's plight. Lol. This whole movie is a joke, and the joke is on them. Oh I forgot, it's a launch vehicle. But it launched them right out of the galaxy...Suhana Khan is really boring and bad actor. LA me kaise padhaya re acting. Other two are slightly better than her but that doesn't say anything about bad acting. Please do not watch this cringe fest !",
    "1": "What a horrible one this was. Wanted to just abandon the movie mid-way. Poor direction, poor storyline, poor acting. The actors didn't even look good. Their accents were funny. Seems like Zoya Akhtar made this movie just for a few Bandra houses. Amitabh Bachchan's grandson is not hero material at all. Suhana Khan didn't fit well. She is similar to Swara Bhasker. Rich roles won't suit them. Khushi Kapoor looked funny. Other actors looked plastic. Wasn't able to find one thing to praise in the whole movie. Maybe some other director could've saved the film. The casting too was poor. All that hype and promotion came down to nothing.",
    "2": "I'm sorry what? If they wanted an Indian adaptation they could've done a simple believable story. It started with a such a ridiculous self effacing colonialism loving bootlicking concept. Its so tone deaf they have no idea people are reclaiming their lands, their origins and a story which makes half Indians half colonizers look superior and unique, is not going to fly well with the audiences. This is neither for Indians, nor NRIs nor the International audience who will be absolutely clueless because they have been brought up on slumdog Millionaire and will consider this a wannabe project. It makes its proximity to whiteness as a USP and is a leap ahead of something Karan Johar would make. Again self effacing as can be. I have to say I like Suhana Khan's debut a lot. Nothing against her she looks like a beautiful humble girl, a really promising actress and really believable for this role. I think she is meant for much grittier cinema. I am so excited for her future she has her dad's easy charisma and relatability but this show is not it. Wish her the best and would love to see more of her in future.",
    "3": "The Archies is a movie set in the 1960s where you will hardly find any element to make you feel that way. This is a highly unrealistic, impractical movie which has been produced just to launch the already privileged ones.The acting has been pathetic by most actors and they can't connect with the audience whatsoever. Suhana Khan is nowhere near to the legacy of her father. Agastya Nanda hasn't acted any better as well. The acting was way too lifeless without any expressions and emotions. I suppose last name shouldn't be the only criteria for casting actors in a film.Overall the movie is a strict NO NO! Avoid it even if it doesn't cost you anything extra monetarily. After all time is also money, right?",
    "4": "I had been an admant Archies reader and I am so sorry to say that if I have come to the conclusion that this movies is marry shellys Frankenstein Archies, I would like to see the end very same an isolated Frankenstein isolated with his creator in an abandoned island . The least Pya could have done was introduce the characters to the new audience the viewer has zero attachment to the green park, the audience has zero clue on who is Archies who is Monika who is juggerhead. Everything is so messed up if I couldn't see it half way through I am sure most have not. Over all I'll say Zoya Akhtar is solely responsible for this Frankenstein creation. Even Robert de niro looked good in marry shellys Frankenstein. Kuddos to Zoya for destroying a classic. Ban her.",
    "5": "Yawning.....yawning ........ YAWNING\nWhat is this movie ....or is it ????Boring , predictable, animated and enough to make anyone sleep ...even those suffering from insomnia\nWhat were they thinking while scripting it and then shooting it\nThe songs are just so banal , nothing feels real\nEspecially the debutant actresses suhana Khan and Kyushi kapoor were soar to the eyes\nThe boys faired better and promising.ALY KHAN was the only character that caught my attention\nI really hope that all aspiring actors , directors learn a good lesson from\nThis POOR film and not repeat such a grave folly ...a MASSIVE BLUNDER.",
    "6": "As someone who grew up immersed in the world of Archie comics, the movie provides a nostalgic journey through Riverdale. However, the overly staged scenes and picture-perfect aesthetics strip away the charming simplicity that made the comics so endearing. It's like watching beloved characters come to life on an overly polished stage, losing some of the quaint authenticity that made the original stories timeless.Despite its generous budget, the movie unfolds like a meticulously staged school play, with scenes that feel too rehearsed and a picture-perfectness that borders on artificial. The characters seem confined to their designated spaces, leaving the film lacking the organic energy that often defines memorable cinematic experiences.",
    "7": "I had hoped to give this film negative ratings if possible. The storyline is incredibly stale and follows the typical Bollywood formula, making it mundane and uninteresting. The dialogues are irksome, and the acting lacks expression. It's perplexing why Netflix produces such uninspiring and dull movies. It's unclear who the target audience is, but it certainly doesn't seem to appeal to the younger generation. The actors contribute to the film's negative aspects with their boring, monotonous, and expressionless performances. Their dialogue delivery lacks vigor, and they struggle with maintaining a proper Hindi accent. I strongly advise against watching this movie as the time spent on it is time you'll never get back.",
    "8": "Oh my God what a waste of time. Suhana khan does not know how to act just like his dad shahrukh khan. She doesn't have any beauty nor khushi kapoor. No story, no acting no screen play only boring music every other minute . Doesn't accept such a horrible movie from Zoya akhtar. I love her movies like Dil dharakne do. But this movie is a super flop with super flop actors and actresses. The film was so boring\nTo be honest i couldn't tolerate Suhana khan and every other actor acting in the movie. I had such high hopes from this movie and from Zoya akhtar but she has failed terribly. Please save ur time and watch Shaun the Sheep cartoons instead!",
    "9": "I have never ever seen such bad acting in my life. This is undoubtedly the worst film of 2023. Suhana and Agastya are the worst actors ever. Don't know what zoya was thinking casting them. The film is boring and painful to watch. The dialogues are irksome, and the acting lacks expression. It's perplexing why Netflix produces such uninspiring and dull movies. The actors contribute to the film's negative aspects with their boring, monotonous, and expressionless performances. So take my advice and save your time as well as bandwidth. This film does not deserve your attention. Netflix you disappoint me.",
    "10": "Didn't know it would be this bad... This movie was a big letdown. The story wasn't good at all, and the acting was even worse. There were parts that made me cringe, like when they kept saying \"thank youuuu\" over and over again. It was really irritating. Suhana's voice was very annoying, and Khushi's facial expressions made me want to skip her scenes. The songs were not pleasant to listen to either. Honestly, I can say that even if someone offered to pay me, I wouldn't watch this movie again. It was just that bad. I was really disappointed. Only the scenes were pretty but other than that please just don't watch this move!!!",
    "11": "The movie lacks the story and you can no talent interms of acting from these actors and when you see leads you will wonder how they even got this role. Especially character of Veronica, how can they give that role to someone who knows nothing. If you really want to watch something interesting watch Riverdale s1 &2.There are so many songs in the movie which are no way near catchy. The whole reason why Riverdale was so successful because they used good old music and in case of bollywood they already had that too but they still tried making new music and boy it sucks.Nothing interesting about movie, please ignore.",
    "12": "I and a lot of my friends did see the film on the first day. Yay, a win for Netflix and the producers. But while it is a 'finnishable' film, the acting and writing are mediocre.The setting is lovely with great art direction and camerawork. The support cast such as Koel, Tara, Alter, Ally, Luke, etc. Do a reasonable job and are probably the reason why the film even makes it on the ratings chart.The dissappointment is really the acting skills (if any) of all of the lead characters and sadly, the writing and direction failed them. With so many songs, they hardly had screen time to build their charatcers. Nanda was not a good archie and I wonder if Raina and Nanda would have been better off switching their roles. Nonetheless, they were dissapointing as were the ladies. SK, KK and AS were abysmal. Difficult to connect with them.The writing, at random songs, costumes, character development, dialogues seemed off. Betty, Archie and Ronnie have limited expressions and very similar dialogue delivery. Of all, Jughead was the most dissapointing as there was nothing Jughead about him. How can you ignore that signature hat and put in a goofy ascot? How can certain standard elements not be a part of the writing, such as Moose getting after Reggie or banters between Archie and his dad over money. There seemed little connect with the world of Archie comics or riverdale.Overall, just icing and no cake.",
    "13": "In first ten minutes you will see so many cliche scenes, that you just want to finish it in fast forward because you already paid for this month subscription fees to Netflix. I am big comics fan but I couldn't relate to one single character emotionally.Movie is far from reality and if AI will be able to generate complete movie, their artificial character will perform better than these actors.Cons: Bad acting, bad story line, bad judgement in background and music creation.Pros: you paid for the Netflix subscription so you can watch it.There is a scene where lead actresses was laughing where as it was an emotional scene as she is metting her after long time.",
    "14": "The film lacks life, grandeur and originality. The script is shallow, and the plot feels extremely stale, making the movie dull. It doesn't appeal to a culturally aware sophisticated audience. This movie might attract wannabe teenagers who doesn't know what life is outside their father's cocoon. This is not Hollywood, this is not Bollywood; this is lacking identity.When a comic is recreated directors and actors should consider that execution of that nostalgic moments will be risky. Most of the time it ruins the original. This film, though musical was lacking that connection. So maybe the plan was to just make something for Netflix. Okay, there was one great line in the movie, to understand culture, one needs to go in, not out (of the country). Yes, then my question is is this movie in or out?",
    "15": "What on earth are these bad actors doing in a film directed by Zoya Akhtar? The question you will surely as yourself in the first 15 minutes of the film. This is good themed movie ruined by bad screenplay and bad acting. All the actors in it are just bland and straight faced.Good work in DOP and music but you cannot stand the loose screenplay and terrible acting.The actors were just not trained enough for such a movie, these are young actors unfortunately also not very sane. Unlike series like Class which had amazing cast also young these series solely tries to be depend on it's esthetics and not on story or acting.",
    "16": "The narrative, riddled with inconsistencies and lackluster storytelling, fails to engage viewers on any meaningful level. The subpar acting and uninspired direction contribute to a disconcerting viewing experience. It becomes particularly disheartening when considering that the creators had the audacity to assume the target audience would find merit in this cinematic misstep. The actors were fixated on their looks, neglecting the delivery of simple dialogues. The culmination of these flaws underscores a concerning trend, suggesting that perhaps Bollywood, as a whole, is on a downward trajectory. This cringefest made me sad and furious at the same time.",
    "17": "Awful dialogue delivery, forgetable songs and cliche plot... Extremely disappointed by this Zoya Akhtar's directorial. If Hinglish would have been a language, that's what the actors were acting in. English accent with hindi dialogues that too very surfac-y kind of. No depth in characters nor even in performaces. Some of the good performaces were of Veronica's father, the guy who was working in Press. Songs at every other second make no sense and it was exhausting to watch. Also songs were easily forgetable. The actresses were there just to look good. Also Veronica's walking style was horrible. Betty was a little bearable. Andrews two timing the main lead and gets away with this so easily makes it a little unbelivable.",
    "18": "Suhana Khan and agastya nanda were really bad and did not perform well. Khushi Kapoor on the other hand was a treat I loved watching her on a screen reminded us of sridevi maam. DOT and dilton did a amazing job they should have received more screen time. But the 2 most fantastic and exceptional performance was by mihir ahuja and vedang raina. I loved the scene between Dilton and reggie it was so good. They gave the story away in the trailer it's just that nothing else to look forward in the movie. I hope they would have given preference to jughead and other characters story line. Because suhana khan and agastya nanda fumbled in dialogues and couldn't even keep up with the choreography they just weren't good.",
    "19": "Was really excited to watch this movie, but so disappointed. There's nothing to get excited when you watch the movie the entire movie is for saving a green park. They didn't go on detail. In one scene Betty is talking to Veronica that she's can't wear short dress in Riverdale as she's not in London & after the very next scene Betty was wearing short dress as well. Like wtf!Except good music there's nothing to watch.It's just waste of time. Not for teenagers & kids also.About acting Khushi Kapoor's proved that she's worst than janhvi & Arjun. Suhana was so over. Agastya was little better. I really loved Mihir Ahuja's acting he was phenomenal in the entire movie. Dot is quite impressive.",
    "20": "I have stop watching after 30 min it is sooo boring and cringe. If you're looking for a film that will test your patience, assault your senses, and leave you questioning the very concept of wasted time, then The Archies is the perfect cinematic disaster for you. This movie is a masterclass in how not to create compelling storytelling, engage an audience, or deliver any semblance of entertainment From the opening scenes to the painfully drawn-out conclusion, every moment of The Archies feels like an eternity of regret. The plot, if you can call it that, is a convoluted mess that seems to have been concocted by throwing random story elements into a blender and hitting the puree button. Characters lack depth, development, or any discernible reason for their existence.",
    "21": "20 minutes in, I couldn't!! The screenplay was terrible & while the cinematography was above average, overall I couldn't get through the movie. Suhana's acting was subpar & Khushi's acting was bland but one thing they had in common was that both of them couldn't emote well. Don't even get me started on their Hindi diction. Agastya has 0 screen presence. Mihir Ahuja stood out among the cast. Dot & Yuvraj Menda weren't bad either. Vedang Raina was alright.The music may be the only saving grace but too many songs! As a huge Zoya Akhtar fan, I am truly disappointed. After giving us ZNMD, Dil Dhadakne Do & Made in Heaven, this is shockingly catastrophic. The amazing reviews full of praise from leading entertainment portals don't make much sense to me. Inspite of the good reviews, PR won't change perception at ground level.",
    "22": "If you are making a movie for netflix then the director should also look at the other content available on the platform. Compare to all the content available this movie is seriously bad and it is not the actors I am blaming. Yes, most actors are new but the direction, script, dialogue everything is cringe fest.Actors who played Reggie and Doily were good. Suhana, Khushi and Agastya were probably under too much pressure and might have done better if it was a different movie. Khushi' makeup and hairstyle was so bad, I felt sorry for her. Suhana at least looked good. Agastya was good in some scenes though.",
    "23": "Complete movie feels like we as Indians are trying to fit in the western culture. Khushi Kapoor can't even speak Hindi properly. This is just disgusting. Its a total chick flick and does not bring any content to the viewers. This is another way to force the star kids to become the idols for our future generations. These kids lack passion and compassion and only thing they are learning is to look good on screen by wearing designer clothes. Agastya Nanda and Mihir Ahuja have the good screen presence rest entire cast is a misfit. Director could have adapted to Indian culture instead of trying hard to look English.",
    "24": "About time movie-makers remember \"Why do people go to movies?\" It is to be entertained. To be entertained because the story moved us, not because it was So boring that it helped with sleep, or because it was so bad we laughed till stomach hurt.For those involved in the making of this movie - this was a disaster in every which way. However, don't loose hope, only failures define successes. Audience is normally forgiving in time. But if anyone is praising you for this movie, remember - they need something from you that is not related to your acting career/talent, they are not your true well-wishers. Again don't loose heart at this, onwards and upwards.",
    "25": "Archies, the Bollywood adaptation of the famous comic, falls short of expectations. The actors' forced performances, seemingly driven by their famous backgrounds, contribute to a lackluster film. Despite the current hype surrounding Archies, my anticipation turned to disappointment within the first 20 minutes, which was expected.The film, far from something to look forward to, left me rolling my eyes and cringing throughout. The overhyped expectations did not align with the reality of a lacklustre cinematic experience, especially for those familiar with the quality of shows like Riverdale. The persistent trend of remaking content that's not required adds to the overall disappointment.",
    "26": "Suhana and Khushi's acting was just off. Their dialogue delivery was just bad. A lot of awkward pauses. I don't think Suhana had that Veronica energy at all. I felt KUSHI needed to loosen up a bit. Actually loosen up a lot. They did the musical part fine but their scenes were just super awkward. I thought Aditi Dot/Ethel acted well. Jughead, Archie and Reggie were fine too, but it was rough watching Suhana and Khushi.The movie could have benefited from replacing SUHANA and KUSHI. Their casting felt forced. Zoya could have changed it up a bit.The movie itself was not bad for Archie Indian adaptation, but Ronnie and Betty's acting had the quality of an Indian school annual day skit.Not quite the quality one would expect from a Bollywood movie.",
    "27": "I love zoya's films so i was excited for the story line even if the actors wouldn't be good but nothing was good about this film. Suhana was scary to look at at times the way she delivered her dialogue and the antagonists were extremely predictable and had zero depth. It felt like no one was really into their dances or characters for the purpose of story telling..just for the purpose of making it to the big screen. I didn't mind agastya i enjoyed his dancing. I fell asleep towards the end and i usually never fall asleep watching movies. Khushi was mid but no aspect of it was amazing. It felt like a school play and not a bollywood film with that much legacy.",
    "28": "It is musical movie, however the story is not strong enough to hold for 2 hours , the main characters Suhana and Agastya are not impactful, Vedang Raina has got the spark and if he got better roles he can outshine, He could be next big thing. Other than that film gets boring eventually. The primise of movie is of a city where only angloindians live and Archie and his group of friends are to save of a park in this city, Storyline is very boring, although the cinematography of the movie is good, Riverdale is a place where everyone would want to go. Jughead played by Mihir Ahuja and Reggie played by Vedang Raina are star of the show , Archie played by Agastya , Betty played by khushi and Veronica played by Suhana were ok ,it was not a good performance rather below average, the dialogue delivery fell flat , they sounded same. It is really disappointing to see them three, the character artist are really good specially Alyy Khan as Veronica's father. Watch it of you have alot of time to WASTE.",
    "29": "What did I just watch? The storyline was so stupid as if written by a teenager. The acting was also so bad ( most of scenes were cringey, damn Hindi never sounded so bad : were they all just reading dialogues in some alien language! ) . I expected the movie to be good coz of suhana and Khushi debut, but these girls really need to work on their dialogue delivery, expression and realistic performance ( everything seemed too fake) . I know it's a musical but musicals don't have to be this cringe. Literally fast forwarded most of the scenes. Even the song lyrics could be so much better. I wonder who even liked the storyline to produce it and infact why would someone release such an underwhelming film which has so many weak points. Quite disappointing indeed. Utter waste of time 😌",
    "30": "I am sure we all have heard about Archies comic once in our life time and I think Zoya Akhtar has done full justice to the film what a director! It's such a happy feeling when I watched it with my family! All the characters were on point specially veronica and Betty 👏🏻😍 I think it's a one time watch for sure it will definitely take you to another world of rock and roll! I did not have any idea these star kids were so talented definitely took them for granted but they proved themselves and I think they deserve all the applause, I am definitely going to recommend this film to all my friends and family!",
    "31": "Absolutely insufferable, subpar acting and the abundance of unnecessary musical interludes makes it painful to sit through the movie. The excessive use of musical segments prolongs the runtime unnecessarily, the movie could've been over in an hour. There is no actual storyline, it's so boring and pointless. The two stars are just for the thematic elements and aesthetic considerations. A tedious and arduous viewing experience, characterised by overused and cringe dialogues and an overall lack of engagement. A waste of time, i was actually looking forward to watching this but im just disappointed.",
    "32": "Zoya Akhtar's signature visual style is on full display in The Archies.From the vibrant colors and costumes to the picturesque locations, the film is a visual treat that transports you into a world of beauty and wonder. The music further enhances the experience, with catchy tunes and energetic dance sequences that will leave you wanting more. A feast for the senses and a testament to young talent because it introduces a new generation of actors who are sure to become stars. Their fresh faces and genuine performances bring the beloved characters to life with endearing charm and surprising depth. They are the heart and soul of the film, and their talent shines through in every scene. 🎬",
    "33": "Not worth making this movie. Its a horror to sit there for 2 hours. There are a lot of worth content other than this on Netflix. With the type of screenplay and acting, the film lacks any potential to compete. I don't know why the industry peeps think that in today's age , its gonna be easy to garner out praise from such movies.Learn some acting and public demand and even if doing an adaptation of the Archies, at least don't change the stories to such monotonous storyline of a rich father getting to throw out people out of a public park to make a restaurant. Well, sounds like average bollywood drama.",
    "34": "The film leaves you muddled for spending literally 2hrs of your life. With the boring and overly not needed yet acting skills was totally not worth hype. Suhana Khan's acting is unbearable and as fake as it can get. Nanda tries to be the main character but somehow stays on the side. Khushi Kapoor acting also is not upto the mark. It's a cringefest. It does not even remotely justify the love for age long readers of the Archies comics. Truly disappointed. The only notifiable was Reggie Mantle. He did ace his part and loved his presence on screen. It's a shame to compare it to the most iconic comics.",
    "35": "Riverdale's worst rated episode is still better than the whole indian archies movie.Safe to say not all star kids can act. Khushi, Suhana and Agastya are simply horrible. It was incredibly hard to watch Suhana khan deliver her dialogue at times.Although the actor playing reggie and jughead were impressive, it wasn't enough to save the sinking ship.The story, screenplay and dialogues is just average. Hard to believe this was written by Zoya and Farhan akhtar.I would recommend avoiding this abomination of The archies. Horrible acting, flat story line, bad music and extremely dumb dialogues.",
    "36": "Bad acting, so so terrible. The storyline is slow, boring and draggy. The only saving grace is the set design, costumes and makeup.The movie seems to be made to launch the next gen star kids. The audience might just eat it up as well. No wonder such sub standard, bad movies also supposedly do well.Khushi Kapoor shouldn't act, she's pathetic. Its funny everytime she spoke. Suhana Khan was just tolerable. Why couldnt they cast someone decent. Vedang has screen presence, Mihir Ahuja is under utilized. I yawned everytime the Nanda kid aka Archie came on screen.Not that the story didn't have potential, but it so badly narrated; characters weren't developed enough to feel connected to them. 13 year olds might like this movie.",
    "37": "I created an imdb account just to review this movie. Every scene was vomit inducing, the conversation between friends are so cringe. So fake, their acting is not even worth 50p. I loved reading archies in my school days and now i am having so much ptsd after watching the movie that i dont think i can read those comics ever again.Even a 5 year old could have written a better plot, so disappointing!The acting is disgusting, the songs are bad, the dialogues are cringe and the concept is so lame. Watch it at your own risk.I wish these actors all the best and I hope they do better acting in future.",
    "38": "So this disappointment came after years of hype! I was hoping that Netflix + Bollywood Star Parent money + Zoya Akhter direction will bring something good. But this is very unfortunate that it became nothing. Zoya did show her talent where she could but horrible story, horrible acting delivered nothing. The biggest disappointment in this movie was the starborn kids. I do not want to offend anyone but even though there is no story or plot, Khan's daughter and Bachchan's grand child was the biggest disappointment than the story and plot. I feel ashamed for wasting my time on this. If you have bigger expectations from the marketing, I suggest you hold your horses first then watch the movie.",
    "39": "The songs, trailers and pictures looked super cool but that's about it. The acting, delivery, and story was so bland and boring. There was nothing engaging about this movie. I found myself falling asleep within 15 minutes of starting the movie. Is this the best fresh talent India has to offer? If so, then it is really sad and depressing. I usually love Zoya Akhtar's work but this was one big fat failure. The main characters didn't feel like main characters. The chemistries between the actors were horrible and I found myself cringing so hard at so many scenes. For the amount of high production and marketing that went into this movie, it is so very disappointing. The dance scenes were nice though.",
    "40": "They messed up my childhood memories. Respect for Ananya Pande increased.I had hoped to give this film negative ratings if possible. The storyline is incredibly stale and follows the typical Bollywood formula, making it mundane and uninteresting. The dialogues are irksome, and the acting lacks expression. It's perplexing why Netflix produces such uninspiring and dull movies. It's unclear who the target audience is, but it certainly doesn't seem to appeal to the younger generation. The actors contribute to the film's negative aspects with their boring, monotonous, and expressionless performances. Their dialogue delivery lacks vigor, and they struggle with maintaining a proper Hindi accent.Your time is Precious, Avoid watching this Movie. The time spent on it is time you'll never get back.",
    "41": "The weakest link in this movie is Suhana khan. I dont know why she shake her shoulders in every scene, her dialogue delivery is ver poor and in every scene she kept her expressions same. SK is not best actor but he has great charm, she lacks that too.Among all, I found Agasta Nanda better, he gave some good shots and has potential. Khushi is also decent. Apart for this, there was nothing much, too many songs, too many characters, very little depth in the story line. Riverdale adaptation was ok, not bad.I am not against star kids being launched, that happens everywhere, but just to stuff them somewhere they don't belong to is not fair.",
    "42": "One of the most horrible movies I have ever seen in my life. Acting was so poor, that I couldn't connect with single actor. Suhana khan was doing over acting and Agastya character was dead, didn't feel like that he is a main role player in this movies. Khushi kapoor doesn't know A of acting. Kudos to Mihir ahuja , he was stunning in his role. However, I wanted to see him more. 'Jughead' role was also decisive. I guess, creator's only focused on costumes not on directing and acting.I would suggest people who haven't watched this movie yet, please don't waste your precious time on this dreadful movie.",
    "43": "This movie was an absolute snoozefest. Neither the actors, nor the storyline could have salvaged the film from being a MAJOR FLOP! I have grown up reading Archies comics as a kid, and even though the trailer seemed lukewarm, I was really hoping that film would be better. It was a serious miscast on Zoya's part. I felt that Khushi Kapoor would have played the role of Veronica Lodge better than Suhana. The role of Veronica demanded the arrogance, oomph, and confidence which Suhana Khan failed to portray. She seemed simply too sweet to play the role of Veronica Lodge. She should have played the role of Betty instead. Overall, I am utterly disappointed!!!!",
    "44": "Since its announcement, the movie has been the buzz of the town.From the trailer, I knew what to expect from the movie.Because it's a musical, most people won't enjoy it. However, just one song really stood out to me, the other songs were alright.The town is mix of India and England but all songs were in English and it felt like imitating American musical, there was no Indian touch.The set and production design are superb, wonderfully framed, photographed, and incredibly detailed.Dialogue and screenplay are poor. There is no depth in friendship and family relations. The central theme of savings park and trees does not hold u, as writing fails to develop the history and emotional value of that place. So, every action feels hollow.The only moment which had little impact on me was \"Reggie\" and his altercation with his father. Other than that, there is no relationship or interpersonal dialogue that felt important in terms of their character or the central plot.Casting wise elderly actors performed well. However, only \"Jughead\" and \"Reggie\" performed well among young actors.Yuvraj played Dilton close to what comic is.The camera would cut between lines to conceal Veronica and Betty's improper delivery of language.The movie is mediocre.",
    "45": "The movie is a total let down. The casting is its biggest flaw. The main characters Archie, Veronica and Betty played by Agastya, Suhana and Khushi respectively doesn't do justice to its characters at all.They act worst then children/teens acting in their annual day school performance. They are somehow constantly smiling, mumbling dialogues without moving much of their facial expressions.Netflix India has really lost the plot when it comes to India market. They are betting on projects which are horrible.Would not recommend to waste even 15 minutes on this snoozefest. Thank me later for saving your time.",
    "46": "The movie was outright boring and no storyline. Too many songs.Can't get worse than this. It's just outright waste of time and nothing else. Right from the start, there was absolutely no storyline. Typical Bollywood trying to get star kids into the industry.The songs were happening almost every 10 or so minutes. There was no oomph factor to the movie neither was there any moment where it took our breath away. The movie lacked any kind of story and there was no direction whatsoever. For those who want to waste their money, there are other things you can do rather than watch this movie.Not sure what all the hype was before the movie released.",
    "47": "The movie seems to be made to launch the next gen star kids. In first ten minutes you will see so many cliche scenes, that you just want to finish it in fast forward. Bad acting, bad story line, bad judgement in background and music creation. Bad acting,The storyline is slow, boring and draggy. The only saving grace is the set design, costumes and makeup.

I don't know why the industry peeps think that in today's age ,its gonna be easy to garner out praise from such movies.",
    "48": "Zoya so far has been an outstanding story teller . From lucky by chance to maid in heaven .I am super fan . Archie's opens well. All the lead actors are eager , well cast and deliver on the parts\nthey have . Where it falls short is the storyline.At no point do you feel the urgency of the characters , rooting for the leads or doubting the outcome .Songs are.meh . Zoya previous movies have had a great soundtrack but not this one . Not sure if her intent was to tell a simple story with a simple plot . Also does not seem the industry has found the next star . Agatya seems to be in the mold of ishan khattar then a young Ranbir kapoor .",
    "49": "Don't waste your time like I did...the movie is too boring and a weak storyline. The acting was pathetic, too bad and just no effort at all. Poor job. I don't even know what to write here but i am so disappointed that i have to. Don't understand why the Bollywood stars are hyping this movie up. They're all just lying because the movie is so bad they're all just lying because the movie has their favourite actors kids in them in it also also I just watched the movie because of Zoe, Akhtar, and I am disappointed, disappointed in her also why is Karan Johar praising the movie when he knows it's so bad.",
    "50": "Bad acting. The storyline is so bad, boring and draggy. Waste of money and time. Bad acting, so so terrible. I had to force myself so hard to watch this till end . Such a waste of time . I feel angry how bollywood promotes and launches these rich star kids and while watching this i felt like i am also promoting this . While the film does have its musical highlights, they are often overshadowed by the distracting performances, making it challenging for the audience to fully immerse themselves in the intended emotional journey. The Archies ultimately leaves a sour note, failing to strike the right balance between storytelling and the art of subtle, nuanced acting.",
    "51": "**A Story Lost in Translation:**Set in the fictional town of Riverdale in 1960s India, \"The Archies\" attempts to capture the essence of the beloved comic characters. However, the narrative feels disjointed and unfocused, failing to build any meaningful relationships or generate genuine emotional resonance. The characters, despite being portrayed by star kids like Agastya Nanda, Suhana Khan, and Khushi Kapoor, lack depth and charisma, leaving the audience feeling indifferent to their fates.The film's attempt to adapt classic Archie storylines to the Indian context feels forced and superficial. The iconic love triangle between Archie, Betty, and Veronica is played out in a bland and predictable manner, devoid of the underlying complexities and emotional nuances that made the original compelling.**Musical Dissonance:**One of the defining features of the Archie Comics is the catchy music, which has resonated with generations of readers. Unfortunately, the music in \"The Archies\" fails to live up to the legacy. The original songs are uninspired and forgettable, lacking the energy and charm that are essential for a successful musical film. The inclusion of Hindi versions of classic Archie songs like \"Sugar Sugar\" only adds to the feeling of forced adaptation, highlighting the disconnect between the source material and the film's execution.**Technical Flaws and Directorial Missteps:**Director Zoya Akhtar, known for her critically acclaimed films like \"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara\" and \"Gully Boy,\" seems to have lost her touch with \"The Archies.\" The film suffers from poor editing, inconsistent pacing, and a lack of visual flair. The cinematography feels uninspired, failing to capture the vibrant energy and youthful spirit that are central to the Archie universe.**A Missed Opportunity:**\"The Archies\" represents a missed opportunity to create a truly unique and engaging film. The concept held immense potential, but the execution fell flat at every turn. The film lacks the heart, humor, and musicality that are essential for a successful adaptation.In conclusion, \"The Archies\" is a disappointing film that fails to live up to its potential. It is a bland and uninspired adaptation of the beloved comic book characters, lacking the energy, humor, and emotional depth that made the original so enduring. With a score of 1/10 on IMDb, I strongly recommend that viewers steer clear of this cinematic misfire.",
    "52": "Hey! These individuals are attempting to replicate a Netflix web series. What a disappointing movie. Seriously! Their acting, direction, and storyline are all fake. It felt like a Myntra advertising shoot. There's no coherent story, just a bunch of inappropriate content and nonsensical, forced acting. I'd like to offer some advice to the cast and director: consider pursuing a different path. Why make cinema worse with this kind of production? Regrettably, the movie lacks a cohesive narrative, opting instead for a hodgepodge of inappropriate content and a series of nonsensical, forced acting moments. It's disappointing to see such a blatant disregard for storytelling and authenticity in cinema.",
    "53": "Terrible acting. It's painful to watch the lead actors, especially Suhana .Big let down! The dialogue delivery is horrible. Out of the three leads Khushi is still bearable. Suhana really needs to work on her dialogue deivery, body language etc. She dances pretty decently but nothing great either. There are better debuts with much talented young actors who deserve the chance. After one year of workshop if this is the final out put then I really think these actors rethink their choice of career. It's just terrible to watch, this movie is a big let down by zoya since I have always liked her movies.",
    "54": "A welcome departure from the hero-heroine-oriented melodramatic over-acting Bollywood trash. Kudos to Zoya for pulling off a stylized Broadway style musical. I loved how she adapted an American theme into the section of Indian society that fits best - the Anglo Indians. Lovely period sets and costumes. Simple heart warming story of teen friendship, ensemble cast, groovy music and fab choreography. Refreshing lack of meanness, pettiness, innuendo and violence. I enjoyed it which means the average Bollywood consumer will not. Watch it with the kids - they will love it. And you will love watching with them because there isn't single ick moment in the whole 2+ hours!",
    "55": "Suhana Khan 😆 can't stop internally 😆laughing while😆 saying her dialogues.😆Khushi. Kapoor. Puts. A. Period. After. Every. Word. She. Speaks. Which. Simultaneously. Looks. Like. A. Terrible. Attempt. To. Sound. Seductive.Agastya remind me of Fardeen Khan from Prem Aggan. Has similar Kill Me Now expressions at multiple places.It's a parody of the retro age. Dialogues are written by writers imagining what rich 19 year olds of 1960s used to talk like. Costume Designers - you can take the additional star from the review. I can probably pardon Zoya, directors need to make bad movies once in a while if it would mean additonal money in the house. With this done, let's get on to better things Zoya.",
    "56": "The film is an adaptation of the comics. But the storyline moves so fast one can't keep up. Barring Betty and Archie nobody could do justice to their character. It was ultraboring movie and I think you can skip if you have better things to do with your time.But again, I am impressed by Khushi Kapoor, she did play her part well. Suhana was just not upto the mark, she should find something else which interests her. Agastya Nanda did some justice to the character alongwith Raina.But overall a very poorly made movie by Zoya, one who has delivered masterpieces like ZNMD and Gully Boy. We expected much better from Zoya than launching some star kids.",
    "57": "Started watching the film with less expectations as I did not liked the trailer but, wanted to see how star kids act. Actually watched this movie only for Zoya as one cannot ignore the director who directed films like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Gully Boy, Dil Dhadakne Do etc.If you watch a movie with least expectation and still you do not like it, it means the movie is really very bad.. actually its pathetic. Not happy with Suhana's performance but Agastya has done a good job, even Khushi is quite good. I know many will criticize me for saying not very good about Suhana but one needs to accept the truth. Good things about the movie is songs and the choreography. Though songs are not very good but the presentation is satisfying and it feels that the kids have done hard work only in dancing.Overall 1 star for my side...only for the songs...",
    "58": "Archie's is a movie that tries to cash in on the nostalgia of the Archie Comics, but fails miserably. The movie is set in 1960s India, but it has no sense of time or place. The characters are bland and boring, the plot is thin and predictable, and the acting is wooden and amateurish. The movie is a musical, but the songs are forgettable and annoying. The movie is a comedy, but the jokes are stale and unfunny. The movie is a romance, but the chemistry is nonexistent and forced. The movie is a disaster, but not in a good way.The movie is a waste of time and money, and an insult to the fans of the Archie Comics. It is a movie that should never have been made, and should never be watched. It is a movie that deserves a zero out of ten rating, but IMDb does not allow that. It is a movie that makes you wonder, why did they make this movie?",
    "59": "The soundtrack of The Archies is a musical delight, blending the charm of the 60s with contemporary vibes. Each song perfectly complements the scenes, enhancing the overall cinematic experience. Zoya Akhtar's attention to detail shines through in every frame, capturing the innocence and camaraderie of the iconic Archie gang. It's a visual feast for both fans of the comics and newcomers alike. The chemistry between the lead characters adds a delightful layer to the narrative. It's heartwarming to see the friendships and romantic dynamics unfold on screen. The Archies movie seamlessly weaves humor into its storytelling, keeping the audience engaged and entertained throughout. It strikes the right balance between comedy and nostalgia.",
    "60": "I was an avid reader of the Archie's book and I was really excited to watch the movie. Looks like Zoya Akhtar was more pleased to introduce the star kids than get the story straight. What happened to jughead's hat? What happened to Ms. Grundy's pointy nose, What happened to Mr. Weatherbees's ball head with just two strands of sticking out? What happened to Fred Andrews's pounch? Reggie is forever picking on Archie. Where in the book was Dilton scared of Veronica and Betty. The kids have tried. But really Zoya Akhtar we expected better from you. Shahrukh khan should take over creating the next Archie's since his daughter is in it and hire another director. I am 100% sure it will be a hit, if.",
    "61": "Although the movie has a good environment protection topic but it fails to do justice with its extremely poor story. Too predictable, same old love triangle, forced at places, lame dialogues. The only reason people would want to see it is because of starcast but if you don't have a thing for them, you must skip it. Not worth your time. Watch 12th fail or Sam bahadur instead of wasting time over this.The only thing good about the movie is a few of its songs. Rest it falls flat on everything. This kind of story itself should have been rejected at first place. I can't write more bad the film. Wasted so much time.",
    "62": "Anglophone at its core. I realize that the director was trying to stick as close to the original but it doesn't work - everything seems made of plastic. And not in an interesting way like in Barbie. The songs were just incredibly frustrating. It's a real cringe-fest sadly. Might have been good as a Scream type movie which is laughing at itself. But as a serious adaptation attempt it fails. The dance moves were also just so bleh. Everyone and everything felt forced and manufactured. And there was no hook to the story at all. Why should people watch? I guess to see all the star kids on screen...but it's really not worth anyone's time.",
    "63": "The performances in the entire movie were just too good in the whole movie and I couldn't even take my eyes off the screen even for a min, what lovely set they created and loved the atmosphere Zoya Akhtar created it was so apt to those times, I was totally hooked and how not just that but even the supporting actors were fully entertaining! Suhana and agastya is going to be the next big pair in bollywood I think their on screen presence is so amazing as well! If you ask my honest opinion then everyone has worked hard and put their hearts in this movie and it definitely deserves to be watched and appreciated by everyone.",
    "64": "I couldn't believe that I was watching a Zoya Akhtar movie. She always brings the best out of the actors but in this movie not only the acting was mediocre, but also the camera work was not what I am used to seeing from her.The way the actors were looking at the camera creeped me out. Overall I was only able to watch 1 hr of the film and then I had to stop the torture.Another issue with e film was it was based on 1960s and I don't get it how such an India is possible back then. People were anticipating to see Suhana Khan performance, but I think she will have to work much harder and get much better role in order to succeed. She has the will power to become a star, but it will be tough to get accepted by the audience.",
    "65": "I just came to imdb to see if its just me or the story is actually not that good. I love the cinematography, and the late 70's theme, but the blend is not giving the pinch. Farhan and Zoya work is way too better than this. The triangle love plot is just not as crazy as audience can admire. The acting is good, but the story isn't, also no offences against Suhana khan but her character could have been more witty! I wish these actors luck and may archies do well, but honestly for me its not that good and time consuming . Got tiring pushing myself to watch and forward if something exciting might pop up. Also this indo englo plot is not something i would spend my time on.",
    "66": "Actors did a fantastic job . The story line is not soo catchy but the actors have put life into the story with their emotions. Music is really good .The movie would have been even more better if it had a great story line because it just revolves around one plot the whole time . And you start loosing interest in between but the romances between the characters keeps you going and the interest is kept .The movie does have good teenage love drama which will take you back to your teen collage romance life and will definitely give you a deja-vooo .Overall I would give 7 star for story line and 9 star for acting so an average rating of 8.",
    "67": "The film is based on the fictional American music band Archies, and hence, the idea of setting the story in an Anglo-Indian town is good. The writers have transplanted the story to the experiences of the Anglo-Indian community in the 1960s. We get a mix of accents, hairstyles and personal histories. The Archies is a musical film and hence, it is essential that the songs must be good. Rightly so, the film has a beautiful album. Every song is superbly composed and presented on the screen.However, the main flaw of 'The Archies' lies in its central conflict. On paper, the gang uniting to rescue 'Green Park,' threatened by development, seemed promising. Yet, in execution, it falls short of expectations.Coming to the star-kids, they are okay at the best. They don't really shine through but their characters are flat too and not the most emotive. Suhana Khan does appear to fit the bill of the rich diva, Veronica, as does Khushi Kapoor of the nice and kind Betty Cooper. Agastya Nanda is the happy-go-lucky Archie who is in love with both Veronica and Betty. The one person who does shine in the cohort is Vedang Raina. Vedang truly steals the show with his remarkable screen presence.The Archies can make for a cozy Christmas watch, easy on the eyes and heart. The world is on fire right now and watching beautiful people dancing around in beautiful clothes is exactly what we all need.",
    "68": "Archie and his friends live in Riverdale, a place for Anglo-Indians post Independence. Archie is keen on moving to London, to live with his uncle and pursue his music. There's a love triangle for Archie with Betty and Veronica. The latter's rich dad wants to own most of Riverdale and even take over the Green Park, a symbol of the residents roots. When local businesses are aggressively taken over, it is upto Archie and gang to take matters into their own hands, ofcourse not before the gang teach Archie about the politics and why he should care about it. How they save their Green Park forms rest of the story.It was meant to be a grand launch for these kids right from Agastya Nanda (Archie), Khushi Kapoor (Betty), Suhana Khan (Veronica), Vedang Raina (Reggie), Mihir Ahuja (Jugghead), Yuvraj Menda (Dilton) & Dot (Ethel). Agastya gets to be the main lead, flirting with all the girls and be the lead dancer as well. But it is Vedang Raina who gets multiple impactful scene whereas Mihir Ahuja and Yuvraj Menda make best of their respective scenes, keeping the entertainment quotient high whenever they get their moment. However, Khushi was too stiff and Suhana was better with her dancing skills.I did enjoy the musical, but the screenplay remained uneven. For a simple story, it needed better writing to tighten the pace. In parts, it definitely works with the fun moments among the gang but when the focus shifts to the land grabbing to build a hotel, the story loses it's steam. A grade efforts put in to the costumes, hairdressing and the 1960s setting would've yielded even better results with an engaging screenplay. It can still be watched for Archies adaptation and the few good scenes clubbed with foot tapping music but with low expectations.",

I have partially contributed to this problem by watching half the movie. Thanks to Suhana's Oscar level performance that I couldn't watch it anymore. Actually I am confused, Khushi Kapoor was equally bad. Maybe her awful performance made me turn off the TV. Why do we allow Bollywood to treat us like this? It's our time and money and we need to be able to utilize it better. Absolutely skip this movie. This has nothing for the audience. This is only a launchpad for the star kids.",

I love zoya akhtars/reema's films but this one needs a look at the drawing board.",
    "73": "This is an unwatchable movie, it's start with a poor introduction of the characters and jumps straight to the plot. Also, the actors themselves seem extremely mellow and lifeless. This not an honest adoption but a pretentious attempt to look western. The editing is terrible, the accents are weird and the stereotypical villains who are overtly wicked without any sense of intelligence.The songs in the movie are really unnecessary and do not go with flow of the story.This is a movie that no one asked for and no one will want to watch. Looks like the actors funded this movie themselves to test the water in cinema.",
    "74": "To be honest I only watched it because I'm a very big fan of SRK's and I wanted to see how his daughter is gonna do as an actor and I was not impressed at all. Beside Sohanna Khan being way below average the whole movie sucked. It felt so fake, everyone having a forced smile throughout the whole movie. The setting looked fake, the dialogues were cringe, all the songs were boring, except for the one where the girls are dancing in skate shoes which I found a bit interesting to watch.The story and the characters are not engaging at all, I didn't care about a single one of them except for the girl who worked at the hair salon, she can improve as an actor imo.Pretty sure the rest of the cast are going to be flops since the SRK charm over Sohanna's debut is over now and we've all seen she can't even do a Poo character right.

    "91": "I'm going to start with the positives - set/costume design and music. Although similar set designs have been done many times in Hollywood, it was refreshing to see the quant town of Riverdale reimagined to fit into India. Although it felt like a caricature at times, I think the team and location scouts have done a great job for the most part. The musical numbers are interesting and they served the purpose of a musical themed story and interweaved with the plot well enough.Now the not so great - story and acting. The story really shows nothing new. Capitalistic tendencies destroying small neighborhoods is not a new concept and I felt it took a very long time for the actual story arc to start. The inciting incident for the students to save the park was put way too far along in the plot line and a big part of the story was given to the repetitive romance love triangle between the three main characters, with no real motive, while not giving the other characters an interesting enough story arc. There could have been much more explorations in the C-story and D-story (such as the convo between Reggie and Dilton) and dig more into the raw human emotions but the whole plot seemed to barely graze a personal connection with the audience. As for the acting, the three main actors often fall flat in developing their 3 way love triangle. I felt Kushi Kapoor missing the mark and just delivering the lines plainly while Suhana was a little better poised. However the writing as a whole was not that great to develop these characters for the actors in the first place and make them connect with the audience. Not what I would have expected from Zoya Akthar, who has been splendid in showing character arcs and character growth throughout her previous films.The remaining members of the cast did great and props to the crew for their work and trying to do something different. Writing though was off the mark this time.",

    "103": "\"The Archies\" hits a sour note from the very start, thanks to a cast that delivers performances ranging from uninspired to downright cringe-worthy. The acting, a fundamental element that could have salvaged the film, instead becomes its biggest flaw.Lead by a once-promising ensemble, the cast of \"The Archies\" appears disengaged, phoning in performances that lack authenticity and emotional depth. Even the usually reliable actors fail to inject life into their characters, reducing them to mere cardboard cutouts of their animated counterparts. The chemistry between the cast members is virtually non-existent, making it difficult for the audience to invest in the relationships and conflicts that unfold on screen.One of the film's major pitfalls is the wooden delivery of dialogue, with exchanges feeling forced and devoid of natural flow. Emotionally charged scenes that should have been poignant become cringe-inducing, as the actors struggle to convey genuine feelings. It's a painful reminder of the importance of strong performances in bringing characters to life, and \"The Archies\" sorely misses the mark on this front.Even the charismatic Archie Andrews, typically a beacon of charm, is reduced to a lackluster portrayal that lacks the energy and enthusiasm associated with the character. Supporting characters fare no better, contributing to an overall lack of cohesion in the ensemble cast.In the end, the horrible acting becomes the defining feature of \"The Archies,\" overshadowing any potential redeeming qualities the film might have had. The lack of chemistry, authenticity, and emotional resonance in the performances ultimately leaves audiences cringing and longing for the animated magic of the original characters, rather than enduring this live-action misfire.",
    "104": "Sorry, but this turned out to be a nothingburger of a film. Efforts are visible on the visual aesthetics front, especially in creating a Riverdale that almost looks and feels real (most of it is shot in Ooty and Mumbai's Aarey area), but the same doesn't translate to the storytelling or performances. Given it's a musical, there's a song breaking out every 5-7 minutes in the first hour, and with a very basic love triangle at its core (which is casually treated in the comics), the lack of disconnect becomes evident. Another central issue begins brewing in the backdrop, and this takes up a bulk of the film's second half.In fact, it almost felt like a breather when there was no song popping up for a stretch of 30 minutes or so. This offered valuable time to understand key characters beyond their peripheries. Also, since the film requires Indianizing these comic-book characters, there are some interesting touches. For instance, Jughead is a hardcore foodie but also the guy who questions Archie about his two-timing. Also, it was an inspired storytelling choice not to make Betty and Veronica compromise their friendship for the sake of fickle teenage love. Reggie isn't just the good-looking second fiddle, but he carries the most empathetic core in all of Riverdale. All of this only makes sense when there's enough to make you care for its niche Anglo-Indian characters with niche Anglo-Indian problems.Amongst the 16 tracks, \"In Raahon Mein\" and \"Yeh Saari Aawazein\" are hummable with that quintessential Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy signature. The rest rely on their visual presentation, especially the Dear Diary tracks by Dot. I don't know what to make of the performances overall, but no one really stood out. I may need to see them in more films to make a better assessment (even Jr. Bachchan took years to become a seasoned performer, mind you!). As an \"ensemble\", they do display watchable (?) levels of chemistry. That diverts it from turning into a complete trainwreck.Endnote: Grabbing an Archies double digest to remind myself how GOOD it feels to flip through the pages!",
    "105": "The Archies is just a movie that could & should have been avoided in the first place by NetflixIndia & by a director like Zoya Akhtar who always have been associated with the best of cinema in India, it would have saved Netflix tremendous loads of money to fund in some quality content on the lines of TVF or maybe something like Kohrra or CAT.Story : The Archies starts with the introduction to the town of Riverdale somewhere in the Northern India which is inhabited by the Anglo Indian's(citizens with mixed Indian & European ancestors).We are introduced to the characters of Archie Andrews(Agastya Nanda), Veronica Lodge(Suhana Khan), Betty Copper(Khushi Kapoor), Jughead(Mihir Ahuja), Reggie Mantle(Vedang Raina) & Ethel Muggs(Dot.) enjoying their respective lives in this picturesque town.The story directly dives into the return of Veronica & her family to the town of Riverdale, all the friends uniting back, Archie Andrews stuck in a love triangle & the intentions of Veronica's father to build a big hotel in the middle of Green Park which is heart & soul of Riverdale.Performances : I shouldn't talk about it, because everyone acted really well except the main lead characters, having such a great supporting cast with expressionless lead cast was just painful to watch & it just doesn't end at expressions, even the dialogue delivery is just really bad especially for Suhana Khan & Khushi Kapoor, Zoya it seemed had intentionally avoided taking close up shots for any of the actors.Direction and Screenplay : The Gully Boy director has always shown us how brilliant she is with her cinema be it Dil Dhakane Do or Made in Heaven, she knows on how to engage the audiences to the screen & over here it just seemed as if Zoya was not on director's chair, bad acting, non engaging screenplay, can't imagine Zoya not noticing all this during the shooting.The credits where due, cinematography looked terrific(especially loved the entry scene of Dot on the cycle & camera switching from rear to front), colours/sets/costumes were all perfectly done.Music : This is a musical story and it had to have great music, while some songs are really good such as Sunoh & In Rahoon Mein, the rest feel underwhelming & this is not the expectation when you have Shankar Ehsaan Loy at the helm of it.Good/Bads : Avoid it, save time and probabaly go & watch something worthy, the movie shouldn't have been made in the first place because The Archies has so much to it that you just can't fit all in a short runtime, the audience needs to know Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge in detail, each character needed to have their own arc for the audience to feel for them & connect with them, this is what Riverdale did in the starting seasons even though it lost the grip in last few seasons but still the audience came back in for their favourite characters.The main leads really need to excel on their acting capabilities, dialogue delivery & this movie did not offer them anything that they could take away from their debut launch except the hard lessons.Zoya Akhtar has a dent on her sky high filmography with TheArchies but we still know how good she can be when she wants so waiting for the next Tiger Baby production.",
    "106": "In the mystical land of Riverdale, where time seems to have halted in 1964 and a substantial Anglo-Indian community thrives, Netflix's \"Archies\" ventures forth, aiming to resurrect an era lost in the sands of time. Brace yourselves for a narrative so captivatingly bland that it manages to make amateur productions look like Shakespearean masterpieces.In this idyllic world where clean-faced teenagers engage in what can only be described as \"teenager stuff,\" strumming guitars and engaging in the timeless art of eye-fluttering, the lead characters-Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, Jughead Jones, Reggie Mantle, Moose, and Ethel-grace us with their presence. Because, you know, stereotypes are comforting, aren't they?This Netflix incarnation of the revered Archie comics, which once held sway in select Indian circles, was destined for judgment, for scrutiny: Can this fresh-faced cast, led by Agastya Nanda, Khushi Kapoor, and Suhana Khan, embody these irreplaceable characters? Well, grab your popcorn and prepare for disappointment.Agastya Nanda as Archie, a character meant to embody charm, charisma, and well... substance, falls flatter than a pancake left out in the rain. Khushi Kapoor's Betty is about as exciting as watching paint dry, and Suhana Khan's Veronica? Let's just say the sass seems to have taken a vacation, leaving behind an empty shell attempting to mimic depth.But let's not get carried away by the charisma vacuum at the heart of this film. Oh no, there's more! The narrative, if one could be generous enough to call it that, meanders aimlessly, much like a lost puppy seeking direction in a fog. It's a mishmash of teenage clichés that feels like an uninspired collage of every coming-of-age trope known to humankind.The setting, draped in the alleged innocence of 1964, feels more like a forced nostalgia trip, with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. And oh, the adults! They merely serve as background props, loitering around while teenagers take center stage, their depth as deep as the paper-thin character arcs.Let's not overlook the cultural pandering. Ah, the Anglo-Indian community! Presented with as much authenticity as a theme park caricature, it's a wonder they managed to hit every stereotype bingo square in one go.And what's a catastrophic movie without a script that seems to have been penned by an overzealous middle-schooler attempting their first foray into storytelling? Dialogues so cringe-inducing, they'd make even the most forgiving viewer question their life choices.In conclusion, \"Archies\" is a cinematic marvel-of sorts. It takes the idea of 'so bad it's good' and drives it straight into the abyss of 'so bad, it's painful.' So, if masochism disguised as movie-watching is your cup of tea, prepare for a ride so excruciatingly terrible, it might just make \"The Room\" seem like a palatable masterpiece. Viewer discretion advised-watch at your own peril!",

Fell flat .There was Zero chemistry between any two characters. I'm trying really hard to point out positives but more than the sets or the intro ... nothing else was engaging or likeable.For a story line or characters that have been so over told ... How they missed to make this barely watchable is surprising.The netflix series Riverdale was painful but this movie just made the series seem worth watching:pPut me in a daze.",
    "108": "Coming from Director Zoya Aktar, we had great expectations about the movie 'The Archies'.I'd grown up reading Archie comics and was curious to see how Zoya had interpreted it. But obviously she hadn't bothered with any interpretation or her own take on it. All she has done is take the characters from the Archie comics and placed them in her movie. Thats all. This movie could have been set anywhere and played anyone - but I guess she managed to create a curiosity of sorts for people who have read the comics series.Set in the 60s in a fictional town 'Riverdale', the movie is based on the Archie characters - all played by star kids. Zoya has managed a coup of sorts by scooping in not one, but at least three star kids from big hollywood families. And that seems to be only USP of this overly long movie; she has roped in Agastya Nanda (Amitabh Bachchan's grandson), Khushi Kapoor (Sridevi's daughter) and Suhana Khan (King Khan's daughter) - among other youngsters.But the disappointment was not with their performance - since there was not much they had to do; they were playing typical teenagers - all dressed in the 60s costumes - and of course they typically looked like they were taking part in a period drama! The kids went about singing and dancing and then some more dancing and singing, in a fictional world - after all this is a musical, ain't it!? I kept hoping for the movie to take off, but it never reached take off speed - but seemed happy just pottering about.The problem lay with the luke warm story - even though Zoya herself was one of the authors. The story didn't have any real meat. The songs weren't really memorable either; none of the scenes really sticks to your memory too; you actually feel relieved to get up from your seat when the titles start rolling in.And I still can't believe that this is from the same director who had made movies like 'Zindagi Na Milegi Dubara', 'Gully Boy' or 'Dil Dhadakane Do'!In short 'The Archies' was a big let down. Anyway, that's my 2 bits about this movie - which I guess is more than enough. I rate it 5/10, an average movie.Released today on Netflix.",
    "109": "The movie feels so forced and Suhana just does not know how to talk. She fumbles a lot and can't act and same with Nanda. How was the casting done? By being deaf or blind? On top of forced acting, there is a sad storyline which just doesn't captivate the audience. English or Hindi or whichever language you watch, it just feels cringe and extremely boring. I am wondering what is the target audience for this. They have taken a brilliant comic and made a joke out of it with extremely bad acting. It reminds me of how Sonam Kapoor tried to do Emma and made a fool out of herself but I would still rate her a 100 times over than this . The story here is bad, the dialogues aren't delivered well. It just feels that Zoya lost her plot there and wanted to shove some gibberish to the audience. Everything in this movie is bad. If there was an option of negative ratings, I would have wanted to give that.Zoya, why did you make this? And I am wondering why did I even watch this. Well, I dint finish it because I just couldn't.",

Extremely choppy scene stiching to drag it out for 2hours and 20 mins. All the actors are extremely insipid and I can be accused of exaggerating for calling them \"actors\". Everyone has the same speech inflections and absolutely no variations in emotions.Zoya seems to have taken the brand name and cast names as the only foundation for expecting the film to do well.It fails at every level. One can never expect this to resonate with the Indian audiences, granted- but this does not even ring true and honest with Archie fans.I could go on but this wouldn't allow me more words.",
    "111": "The Archies: A Fumbled Debut\nThe highly anticipated Indian adaptation of the iconic comic strip, \"The Archies,\" sadly fell flat in its Netflix debut. While the premise held promise, the series ultimately delivered a disappointing experience, riddled with weak storytelling and unconvincing performances.A Story Lost in TranslationFrom the very beginning, the narrative lacked direction and purpose. The characters, despite their familiar names, felt shallow and underdeveloped. Their motivations were unclear, their relationships unconvincing, and their dialogue often cringe-inducing in its artificiality. The plot meandered aimlessly, failing to engage the audience or build any genuine tension.Acting Gone AwryThe casting choices, unfortunately, did little to elevate the material. None of the young actors managed to fully inhabit their roles, their performances coming across as awkward and amateurish. They struggled to deliver their lines with even a semblance of naturalism, leaving the characters feeling one-dimensional and uninteresting.A Symphony of DisappointmentWhile the production design offered a vibrant and colorful aesthetic, it failed to mask the fundamental flaws of the series. The musical numbers, a major selling point of the original comic, were poorly choreographed and lacked energy, failing to capture the spirit of the source material.Turning the Page on DisappointmentAfter enduring a mere half-hour of \"The Archies,\" I found myself yearning for the comfort of turning the page. This series represents a missed opportunity to bring a beloved comic to life for a new generation. Instead, it delivered a hollow and forgettable experience that ultimately tarnished the legacy of its source material.A Missed Opportunity\"The Archies\" had the potential to be a delightful and engaging series. However, its poor execution, coupled with weak storytelling and unconvincing acting, resulted in a disappointing experience that left me frustrated and unfulfilled. This is a series I would not recommend to anyone, unless they are curious to witness a classic comic strip being thoroughly butchered.",
    "112": "I don't know why did I even click on it. The acting is so bad. It's \"beta uncle ko acting kr k dikha\" type of acting. Suhana is doing so bad.1. Her looks don't suit the role she's portraying. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HER SKIN COLOUR. And It isn't about her looks in general. It is about her look IN RELATION to the character she plays. SLB rejected Kareena because she didn't have the landed artistocrat look required for Devdas. It's the same thing here.2. Her voice modulation is cringy. You're playing a character set in an Anglo-Indian town. Stop prolonging every word, and please speak clearly.3. Body language is v off. Sometimes it feels like she's just staring blankly at the person infront of her. Other times it looks like she already knows what the other person will say and is just waiting for her cues.Idk what the future holds, or how big of a star Suhana will become, but this is a very underwhelming start. She's had a year to prep.",
    "113": "I watched the movie without any expectations and yet was disappointed at the end.Seems like the director got Netflix to pay for the launch of Bollywood star kids. And since it's created direct for OTT release, there's no pressure for box office collections.It just became an annual day function for star kids. Not much effort needed when entitled kids express a desire to act. All they have to do is smile, blink their eyes and break into a song and dance at regular intervals. And speak in English accented Hindi. Expressions, emotions, voice modulation, acting - all take a back seat.We Westernize our adaptations so much that finally they no longer seem like an Indian adaptation. It's all about Indians trying to be as non-Indian as possible.The young faces are fresh. That's it. Suhana Khan, Khushi Kapoor, Agastya Nanda show promise. But they have a long way to go. Vedang Raina as Reggie makes an impactful debut. (But the Reggie Mantle character shows no mean streak.)The song Sunooh has a lovely feel and introduces the key characters through a racy track. Rest of the songs seem manufactured on an assembly line. The dialogues give the term bland a new definition. Just pretty settings and costumes aren't enough ingredients for making a film interesting.",
    "114": "\"The Archies\" Netflix movie, where do I begin? It's quite impressive how you managed to take a beloved comic series and turn it into an absolute flop. Your attempt at capturing the magic of the original characters was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.Let's start with the acting. It's remarkable how you were able to assemble a cast that made even the most wooden of performances look lively. The lack of chemistry and depth in their portrayals made it seem like they were reading lines off a teleprompter for the first time.And then there's the story. Or should I say, lack thereof? It's as if the entire plot was thrown together using leftover scraps from rejected teen dramas. It lacked originality, creativity, and any semblance of coherence. It was truly a masterclass in how not to build a compelling narrative.But perhaps the most disappointing aspect of \"The Archies\" Netflix movie was the music. How could you take a franchise known for its catchy tunes and deliver such lackluster and forgettable songs? It's like you drained all the energy and fun out of them.\"The Archies\" Netflix movie is a prime example of how not to adapt a beloved comic series. It lacked originality, and everything that made the original characters so special. It's a forgettable and uninspiring film that won't leave any lasting impression.",
    "115": "I have to say that \"Archies\" falls short in capturing the essence of the Anglo-Indian angle and lacks the authentic Indian feel, appearing more like a Western production. Even the central cafe in the movie resembles an American diner, which is quite disappointing. However, the movie shines in terms of its costume design, cinematography, and its portrayal of the 60s era culture. The background score adds a great touch to the overall experience.On the downside, the lead actors' performances are subpar, while the supporting cast delivers much better acting. Suhana Khan's portrayal of the character Veronica comes across as cringy and overly conscious of the camera. Furthermore, the Hindi-speaking capability of the characters is poor, which detracts from the authenticity of the film.Another questionable decision is the alteration of Dilton Doiley's character from straight to gay, deviating from the original comic and lacking a logical explanation.Overall, \"Archies\" has its positive aspects such as impressive visuals and nostalgic cultural elements, but it falls short in terms of acting, character portrayal, and maintaining the original essence of the story.",
    "116": "In the pursuit of portraying contemporary characters, actors often aim for a demeanor more modern than that of the 21st century. This inclination is observable not only in the realm of global cinema but particularly in Western cinema, where the art of perfecting accents and intricately detailing the nuances of 70s behavior, smiles, and style has been refined. However, a noticeable disparity emerges in the context described. Here, the performers seem to fall short in their attempt to resonate with the charm inherent in animated cartoons.The discrepancy may stem from a lack of synchronization with the whimsical and expressive nature that animated characters often embody. Animated cartoons, with their vibrant personalities and exaggerated expressions, present a unique challenge for live-action actors aiming to emulate a similar charisma. It's not merely a matter of mimicking historical aesthetics but rather capturing the essence of animated charm that transcends time.To bridge this gap successfully, actors may benefit from a more comprehensive study of animated character dynamics, understanding the subtleties of exaggerated emotions and larger-than-life personas. This approach could enable them to infuse their performances with the captivating allure that animated cartoons effortlessly convey, resulting in a more harmonious blend of modernity and timeless charm on the screen.",
    "117": "First, the positives. It's great to see the attention to detail given by Zoya and Kagti, whether it be the call-outs to the good old fashioned comic books (Pop Tate's looks amazing), the aesthetics, the cinematography and the choreography to the songs. It's vibrant, glossy and perfectly captures the mood of the ensemble.However, the negatives far outweigh the positives. Hard to believe it's made by the same folks who have given gems on Indian cinema in the form of the brilliant Luck by Chance, or the breezy coming of age ZNMD. Her last project, Made in Heaven 2 was extremely mediocre, but this one takes the cake.Archies felt empty, the plot is quite simple. The band of youngsters have to save Green Park in Riverdale. There are no palpable moments of tension, camaraderie, and the performances of the cast is extremely poor. Such a banal plot makes the audience disengage from the film and surely, that's something Zoya/Kagti should look into.",
    "118": "The moment this movie started, it was hard to sit through it. I had to mute at times to get through because all the songs are really bad. The plot is expected, the characters very one-tone, dialogues cliche and their delivery even worse. It was very obvious that the movie is focusing on introducing new actors to the audience and there isn't much else.Some Positives:1. The characters' hairstyles and accessories are fun to look at, the wardrobe and sets are nice.2. Females show true friendship instead of envy, which was refreshing.3. The music is not good but the dances and choreography are fantastic.",
    "119": "The movie is simple and soft. It has no fighting or melodrama which other nowadays movies have. This movie is quite interesting like all the Riverdale Episodes. Just a small portion of story taken from the Archies comics. But the names, places, people and all the other things are same to same from the Riverdale Series. Just in Indian style. The story is good. In the beginning 20 minutes, you will bore. But after it will catch the pace with cast. You will go into a beautiful musical journey with the people you have seen and loved in original Riverdale series. The cast has given there 100% in the movie. And there are more than 100 cast members who are outsiders, only 3-4 are star kids. So, don't judge the movie just by watching the cast and trailer.The movie is good with mixture of music and interesting characters which are same as the Riverdale series.If you have watched the Riverdale series. I think you will definitely enjoy this series as it will give you the same memories as you got from the seasons of the original Riverdale series. Because taking everything from the series and putting it into the movie is not a easy task. Hats off to the writers and dialogues who has given the same emotions and depth to the characters as it was in the Riverdale series.The cast is very vast and charming. You will see some faces which you have not seen from quite a long time and they have performed really well. The newcomers, Suhana Khan (Veronica Lodge), Agastya Nanda (Archie Andrews), Vedana Raina ( Reggie Mantle), Kushi Kapoor (Betty Copper), Mihir Ahuja (Jughead), Aditi Dot ( Ethel Mugs), Yuvraj Menda ( Dilton Doiley) has performed well as this is there first big movie.So, if you are watching the film!!So get ready to go into Pops and enjoy the burger and the famous pink milkshake with ice cream and cheery on the top!!",
    "120": "So, this attempt by Zoya Akthar at a Hollywood style musical set in India and in Hindi/English does not work at all. Right from the get-go the scene is set in a very confusing manner. Trying to shoehorn this explanation of the Anglo-Indian community living in the hills of India as a reason they all had Western names was quite frankly laughable.Plot:\nThe plot is quite boring centering around a played-out trope of a group of youngsters trying to save their local park. Along the way there are a number of side plots concerning the personal lives of the characters. Overall, quite predictable and was not captivating in the slightest. The story kept me clockwatching wondering when this would end.Acting:\nThe acting is quite frankly awful. Even cutting some slack for a group of performers making their debuts, they did not really manage to convince me that they embodied their characters. Across the board the delivery of lines was quite wooden, although to be fair the script was largely underwhelming. A rare bright spot in this department is Vedang Raina who gives a good showing as Reggie - the only character with any sort of character development.Songs:\nThere are a number of songs in this movie, each as forgettable and drab as the next. Musicals need great songs to survive, and this lacks completely in that department.Set/Costumes:\nThis is the best part of the film. The set design and costumes are brilliant and really captures the 1960's vibe that the director was going for. It adds a lot to the charm of the film.",

The beloved comic series, known for its fun, romantic, and flirty escapades, seems to have been left in the inkwell, as the film adaptation takes a nosedive into the doldrums of dullness.Watching \"The Archies\" was akin to observing paint dry on the walls of Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe - a task that even Jughead's insatiable appetite couldn't salvage. The film's pacing moved at the speed of molasses on a cold day, making one yearn for the sweet release of a commercial break or, dare I say, an intermission.The characters, once the epitome of teenage charm and wit, were as flat as the paper they originated from. The chemistry between them fizzled out faster than Reggie's latest scheme, leaving audiences wondering if they accidentally walked into a seminar on the history of watching grass grow.In conclusion, \"The Archies\" movie is a cinematic conundrum that begs the question: how can something so rooted in joy and jest turn out to be a masterclass in monotony? It's a film best enjoyed with a pillow, a blanket, and no expectations. Viewer discretion is advised - for the risk of falling asleep is all too real.Next up - Will still root for Suhana and Khushi for their next projects. Hope they pick good scripts, directors and producers.",
    "122": "The first 15 minutes of the movie itself were so cringeworthy that it spoiled the whole mood and left a bad taste over the entire film.Bollywood makes a thousand times better musical movies than Hollywood. Who in the world thought it would be a good idea to make a musical like Hollywood but in Hindi/Hinglish?!?The movie is set in 1960, and there are barely any old white people in the film, considering we are dealing with Anglo Indians, so where are their British grandfathers and grandmothers? Don't tell me all left! And there are so many white Indian kids, but barely any older British people around?English music is clearly from the 60s, but the Hindi music is straight from crappy autotune 2023 Tiktok generation!? The only good song comes at the end of the movie, which is by Arijit. They missed the perfect opportunity to have classical music, which was culture back in the day. The whole film should have been in English rather than in Hindi/ Hinglish. I don't know why, but it felt like it was not made for an Indian audience, and I live in Canada. I'm Canadian-Indian, even I couldn't relate.The amount of money it went to make this clearly shows how good the cinematography looks, especially because of Zoya; she's a fantastic Director with her excellent camera work, but the movie itself is cringe. I feel bad for Suhana because I was looking forward to seeing this; all the actors did an \"OK\" job. I cannot say everybody was amazing because the movie itself is below mediocre, and it's filled with bad writing(dialogues).Conclusion: don't fix something that's already perfect. This could have been a fantastic film if they had filmed this like a normal Bollywood movie, which is basically a musical. Hands down, Zoya's worst work.",
    "123": "The movie loses steam in the second half and could have been more engaging as the conflict escalates. Solutions are convenient, and the resolution is trifling. Overall, while the era, the look and feel have been created well, the movie ends up a tad underwhelming. What is delightful is watching a bunch of fresh new faces put their best food forward - whether for emoting on screen or doing some rock n roll the 60s tunes.Adapting a story is a daunting task, and while we commend Zoya and Reema for their effort, will 'The Archies' reach the global acclaim achieved by 'Squid Game' for South Korea? Only time will tell! Catch 'The Archies' on Netflix.The film could have also been a tad bit shorter. Some scenes like Betty finding out about Veronica and Archie could have been written tighter. By the time the film reaches the climax, you are already zoning out of it. The climax is also done in a bit of a hurry and is predictable. With The Archies, it is evident that Zoya had a lot in store for the young generation and wanted to balance out every character but the task of it took a toll on the overall story. Should you watch The Archies? Give it a shot for the cast, look, and feel of the movie.",
    "124": "The Archie's is not just a bad film, it's a cinematic abomination that actively defiles the cherished memories of generations of fans. This soulless cash grab takes beloved characters and subjects them to an agonizing torture chamber of bland acting, ear-splitting music, and a story that makes paint drying look like a thrilling roller coaster ride.Let's dissect this disaster piece by piece:1. Acting that Would Embarrass a Middle School Play:The actors in The Archie's deliver performances so wooden they could be used as firewood. Instead of capturing the vibrant personalities of the characters, they stumble through their lines with all the emotional depth of a cardboard box. The forced smiles and melodramatic deliveries are enough to make you question the very existence of acting as a profession.2. Music that Inflicts Auditory Pain:The soundtrack of The Archie's is a symphony of sonic torture. The songs are bland, uninspired, and forgettable before they even finish playing. They fail to capture the energy or spirit of the original music, instead sounding like rejected demos from a 1980s high school talent show. The choreography is equally atrocious, featuring awkward movements and formations that would make even the most uncoordinated person cringe.3. A Story that Insults the Intelligence of a Single-celled Organism:The plot of The Archie's is so predictable and tired that even a goldfish could predict its every twist and turn. It's a rehash of every cliché teen film trope you've ever seen, complete with the predictable love triangle, the \"save the day\" finale, and the characters learning some trite lesson about life. It's a complete waste of time that could be better spent watching paint dry or listening to nails on a chalkboard.4. A Betrayal of the Source Material:The Archies is a slap in the face to the original comics. It takes everything that made the characters and their world unique and lovable and throws it out the window. The film replaces the wit and charm of the comics with a bland, sanitized version that feels like it was created by a committee of accountants. It's devoid of originality and soul, leaving viewers feeling hollow and disappointed.5. A Film that Should Be Encased in Concrete and Buried at the Bottom of the Ocean:The Archies is a cinematic catastrophe of epic proportions. It's a film that should be studied in film schools as an example of everything that can go wrong in a movie. It's insulting to the intelligence of the audience, a waste of time and talent, and a stain on the legacy of the Archie Comics. If you ever come across this film, do yourself a favor and run the other way. Save your ears, your eyes, and your sanity.",
    "125": "I neither fancy musicals nor do I hold any interest in the 'Star' kids having their debut appearances. I just adore Zoya Akhtar as a filmmaker; I came for her, and I have to say, with a heavy heart that I'm disappointed.For a director who has previously given us works like Dil Dhadakne Do, Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara, and Gully Boy, expectations necessitated a better showing from her.However, I'm not implying \"The Archies\" is terrible all throughout; it did have a couple of notable moments, but not enough to be effective as a feature film overall.It tends to shine in its lighthearted junctures, all thanks to an impeccable art direction and a groovy, infectious music album, which will leave an impression if you are an admirer of the genre. Mind you, I'm not, but still, I liked the songs and the way they were visualized.The problems start to surface whenever and wherever there's a shift of undercurrent emotions. Zoya's writing, for some odd reason, couldn't capitalize on the drama, the so-called 'peak points' of the script falls miserably flat, fumbling its way out, extremely unlike of the Zoya I know and love.Speaking of the cast, I've got mixed feelings about it; some did decent, some hugely underperformed.Now I don't want to be overly critical, because most of them have just begun their journeys and are expressing themselves in front of a film camera for the very first time, but I have to say they all need to improve in so many areas.Regardless, if I were to pick one, it would be Vedang Raina as Reggie; this kid showed some promise, not gonna lie.",
    "126": "Anwar Says: Don't expect wonders from this Zoya Akhtar's Netflix release, just enjoy the nostalgia and childhood vibes sweep through every sequence. Don't expect star kids to do something extraordinary , just enjoy their innocuity and singing about everything . May not have the brilliance of Zoya's earlier films but the audience born in'60s and '70s would correlate and remember the railways book stall, where Archie's comics were available.Mention of Cliff,Elvis and Beatles, bottles of Goldspot, ad of Cinthol soap on radio and icecream Sundays with Jughead, Betty, Veronica, Reggie, Dilton and Ethel around at Riverdale , what else you need to remember your adolescence. Coming to the performance , Khushi Kapoor as Betty and Vedang Rainna as Reggie looked matured. You can figure out Suhana Khan , as daughter of Shahrukh Khan , when she speaks. Aagastya Nanda as Archie has acting in his genes from his Nana and Nani.Nobody has been shown as real villain, even Reggie doesn't envy Archie, both Betty and Ronnie love Archie but not at the cost of their bonding. Enjoy the lyrics of Javed Saheb with brilliance of Shankar- Ehsaan-Loy revisited music of ,60s.

    "127": "I had so much expectations from the movie and had been waiting eagerly since all the lead actors belong to such rich acting backgrounds. Despite of having a beautiful cinematography the soul of movie was missing.Everything looked unconnected.. their lifestyle, their accent ,their acting, weak story !! And songs?? I literally fast forwarded each and every song since couldn't feel connected with any!Agastya was ok. Weaker in acting I felt was Suhana Khan..unclear speech, blank expressions,incorrect body language. Kudos to Khushi Kapoor though. She did a better job than other 2 leads.But at some places I had to rewind back and even check subtitles to check what they are speaking. No clarity of speech!Zoya Akhtar has set benchmarks with her movies in the past but this one is a complete failure.Just felt it had to be made .. they just made somehow and delivered..\nI wish team had worked more harder.",
    "128": "The hate the new comers are getting is uncalled for. It's just their first movie. They obviously have to keep working very hard.And the movie literally based in an Anglo-Indian community, the language used is just fine.(Appropriate enough for the Indianess...but also for the generation it is set in)The movie on the other hand tried their best to make it this generation appropriate but failed in all except the fashion and maybe the musical side.The storyline is tried too many times at this point, even schools perform this for their plays.The direction was good as expected out of the star director.Overall a great movie to watch to pass the time or a movie to watch during meals.",
    "129": "The anticipation surrounding a new cast in a film or show is often met with eagerness, as audiences hope for fresh talent and compelling performances. However, the disappointment can be palpable when these expectations are not met. In the realm of entertainment, the craft of acting serves as the bedrock for delivering a narrative effectively. It is disheartening to witness instances where this crucial aspect appears to falter.Equally concerning is the apparent misfit between certain actors and their assigned roles. The success of a portrayal hinges not only on the actor's skill but also on how seamlessly they can embody the essence of the character. Unfortunately, there are instances where the chosen actors seem out of sync with the roles they are meant to bring to life. This discord disrupts the suspension of disbelief that is vital for immersion in the storyline.In the realm of entertainment, where storytelling and character portrayal intertwine, the importance of strong acting cannot be overstated. It is the conduit through which audiences connect with the narrative on a visceral level. The disappointment stemming from lackluster performances and mismatched casting underscores the vital role that acting plays in the overall success of a production. As viewers, we yearn for the magic that unfolds when a talented cast breathes life into a story, and when that alchemy falls short, the impact is keenly felt.",
    "130": "The movie is set up in a hypothetical Anglo Indian town called Riverdale . The resemblance to the comics ends there . The rest is what continued to be a horrendous adaption of the Archie's comics with an Indian twist. The cast are terrible , very poor acting skills , zero screen presence and more over poorly written character arcs . The only stand out is the one that played Archie and Betty to an extent , they try to hold your interests in part but again nothing really notable .Director tried her best but was let down by poor rookie cast . Production designs and costs could be seen on the screen with lavish set pieces reminding the 1950s but all this is let down by poor story and terrible acting. Music is good, choreography for the songs was alrightVerdict: what could end up as Another Student of the Year ends up as a Golden Kela Movie of the year - 1/10 stars.",
    "131": "The Archive movie falls disappointingly short of expectations, leaving viewers with a sense of wasted potential. From the outset, the plot appears promising, centering around a mysterious archive with the potential to unlock secrets of the past. However, the execution lacks coherence, and the narrative quickly devolves into a convoluted mess.One of the glaring issues is the pacing, which oscillates between sluggish and frenetic without finding a comfortable middle ground. Critical plot points are either rushed through or dragged out, leaving audiences bewildered and detached from the characters' struggles. It's a missed opportunity to create a suspenseful atmosphere, as the inconsistent pacing undermines any chance of building tension.Character development is another weak point. The protagonists feel one-dimensional, with shallow motivations and poorly explored backstories. Viewers are left with little reason to invest emotionally in their fates, resulting in a lackluster connection to the film's central figures. Even the talented cast can't salvage the wooden dialogue and underdeveloped relationships that hinder the overall viewing experience.The Archive movie's visual effects are surprisingly lackluster, failing to bring the fantastical elements of the plot to life. Rather than enhancing the narrative, the CGI feels forced and artificial, detracting from the immersive quality one would expect from a film of this genre. The production team missed an opportunity to elevate the story through captivating visuals, and the end result is a lackluster spectacle.Adding to the disappointment is the predictable and formulaic nature of the storyline. The Archive movie relies on tired tropes and fails to inject any originality into its narrative. It becomes evident early on that the plot follows a well-worn path, robbing the film of the intrigue and excitement that comes with fresh, innovative storytelling.In conclusion, The Archive movie is a regrettable misfire, failing to capitalize on its intriguing premise. Poor pacing, lackluster character development, uninspiring visual effects, and a formulaic plot contribute to an overall cinematic letdown. This film falls far short of the mark, leaving audiences longing for the engaging, original experience they were promised.",
    "132": "Overall sense of mediocrity and missed opportunities. The film's storyline is predictable and lacks any real depth or originality. It follows the tired formula of a privileged group trying to understand the struggles of the less fortunate, a trope that has been done to death in countless other films.The direction by Zoya Akhtar is lackluster, failing to bring any excitement or creativity to the screen. The pacing is slow, making the already uninteresting storyline feel even more tedious. It seems that Akhtar's attempts to emulate other successful films fall flat, resulting in a derivative and uninspired work.The performances by the cast are uniformly disappointing. Suhana Khan, in particular, is singled out as a boring and bad actor. Her lack of talent is evident, and it seems that being in LA to study acting has not improved her skills. The other actors fare slightly better but still fall victim to the overall poor quality of the film. The accents and lack of chemistry among the cast further detract from the viewing experience.In conclusion, \"The Archies\" is a wooden, boring, and worst of all, an underwhelming film by Zoya Akhtar. It fails to deliver an engaging storyline, memorable performances, or any real entertainment value. It's a cringe-worthy experience that is best avoided.",
    "133": "Coming from the generation that read Archies, was intrigued what is that they are going to portray with the same characters and eventually i built the courage to watch it.1st Impression: Good Attempt to Indianise the foreign characters\nBut that's the end of the goodness here.While i totally understand the 1st attempt for most of the starkids, but a real disappointment with the experienced backend experts who conducted boot camps and what not to build up the movie or protect the reality which cannot be hidden.. on screen acting.Loads of PR but a perfect & successful attempt to create a disaster. Which they did!!! Bingo!Had to take multiple intermissions / breaks in between the movie as it was not watchable continuously. In short a Brake-Filled Movie... the movie editing staff can actually add some intermission intervals even though it on OTT.2 Stars = 1 Star for the courage of the newbies + 1 Star for Attempting to Indianise the characters.",
    "134": "Bad acting by main cast, bad make up, filled with bad songs and bad dance every few mins .. bad attempt at making a musical! Had to skip all the songs, as the dancing was not tolerable. Supporting cast did a better job.Ruined the good memories from the actual comic book! The characters acting did not really match the actual comic personalities.Have always loved all of Zoya's movies, but this one totally missed the mark. Still wondering why she chose to make it?This movie is more fit for Karan Johar types of launch movies, definitely not a Zoya type movie.1 star for the location set up, design and costume.",
    "135": "Now I get that this film isn't for everyone. For eg. A KGF 2 stan or an Animal movie enjoyer obviously won't like this film. Cause they are not the target audience in the first place. But they will still watch it and give their comments on the film, mean, harsh or downright disrespectful. But they won't sit down to discuss the technical aspects, etc.This film is technically superior to other films, ones that Have even released in theatres. Director Zoya is a master at her craft and you will see perfection in all the shots, angles, frames, camerawork in general, etc. The film is shot beautifully and masterfully. The setting is just on point and makes you feel like you're transported to a different world.This film has heart. The emotional connect bw the characters has been beautifully established by the director. The story though simple, just connects with you. The musical numbers are nice and fantastically choreographed. The new bunch of actors shine in these musical scenes. They all have such good screen presence. Agastya I think he's a sure shot future star. He possesses charm and is smooth and just breezes through his role. Suhana seems to have gone into a character which may resonate with some and less with others. That's fine though cuz I believe she has potential. She was nice though and def shone in some scenes. Khushi is just beautiful and has good screen presence. Her smile and expressions and body movements are just on point and she has character. It's a good sign since she obv wants to establish her career in the industry. Rest everyone, Dot., Mihir, Vedang and Dilton were also quite good. Vedang however, man he's like a young Ranveer Singh. I can totally see him becoming a big star in the future with his looks and charismatic.Overall, this movie is something I was highly anticipating the release of since long and it did not disappoint. It gave me exactly what I signed up for and more. Good job Netflix and Zoya, no one could have done it better than you. What a launch you've given these new actors. Peace!",
    "136": "As I settled into my seat to watch \"The Archies\" in 2023, I couldn't help but feel a rush of nostalgia. Back in my teenage years, Archie Comics were a beloved pastime, and now, here they were, reimagined on the big screen as a live-action musical comedy set in 1960s India. Directed by the talented Zoya Akhtar and produced by Tiger Baby Films and Graphic India, this film took me on a delightful trip down memory lane.The story revolves around the fictional music band associated with Archie Comics, bringing to life the iconic characters that have charmed readers for decades. The ensemble cast, featuring Agastya Nanda, Khushi Kapoor, Suhana Khan, Vedang Raina, Mihir Ahuja, Aditi \"Dot\" Saigal, and Yuvraj Menda, breathes fresh life into these beloved personas.From the very beginning, the film struck a chord with me, transporting me back to a time when Archie, Betty, Veronica, and Jughead were an integral part of my world. While this Indian adaptation may not resonate as strongly with the current generation, it masterfully captures the essence of the original comic books.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to make the comic book universe come alive on the screen. The sets, costumes, and overall production design evoke a sense of nostalgia while adding an Indian flavor to the mix.As for the performances, I was pleasantly surprised by the newcomers. Suhana Khan, Agastya Nanda, and Khushi Kapoor have faced their fair share of criticism, with some labeling their acting as \"raw\" or lacking. However, I couldn't help but appreciate their efforts. Acting is a craft that evolves with time and experience, and these young actors showed promise. It's important to remember that they are still in their early twenties, and expecting them to deliver seasoned performances is unfair.Overall, \"The Archies\" provided me with a heartwarming and entertaining experience. It successfully marries the timeless charm of Archie Comics with an Indian twist, making it a delightful watch for both fans of the original series and those looking to relive a piece of their own past. In a world where being critical seems to be the easiest job.I choose to celebrate this film as a tribute to the nostalgia of my youth and the enduring appeal of Archie and his gang.",
    "137": "The Archies\" (2023) on Netflix is a cinematic catastroph. From its incoherent plot to unrecognizable characters, this film fails on every level. The misguided attempt at humor and a haphazard narrative make for a painful viewing experience.What's truly cringe-worthy is the introduction of a new star cast, primarily consisting of star kids. Their performances are a masterclass in mediocrity, with wooden expressions and lackluster delivery that make you long for the days when acting was an art. The chemistry among the ensemble, if one could generously call it that, is non-existent, resulting in awkward and forced interactions that feel like a painful school play.Cinematographically, the film is a jumbled mess, attempting to blend various styles without any cohesive vision. It's a visual assault that leaves you questioning the director's sanity. The iconic Archies characters are reduced to lifeless caricatures, and the once-charming dynamics among Archie, Betty, Veronica, and Jughead are lost in the sea of incompetence.The soundtrack, featuring The Archies' music, is a feeble attempt to salvage the wreckage. Unfortunately, even the catchy tunes can't distract from the fact that this film is a prime example of how not to adapt beloved characters to the screen.In conclusion, \"The Archies\" (2023) is a cringe-inducing disaster with a cast that epitomizes the worst in new-age star kids. Their performances, coupled with a chaotic plot and abysmal cinematography, make this film a regrettable addition to Netflix's library. Save yourself the agony, and bypass this zero-star debacle.",
    "138": "The Archies is a special film undoubtedly. Rarely do we come across a movie from the Hindi film industry that is this warm, energetic and youthful. Zoya Akhtar takes us in an unique journey to a fictional world that most of us have imagined during our childhood.Like the comics the film is a bright heaven of ideas where the young can breath, live and dream a life that they want. It's imperfect and far from truth but that's what Archies is. Akhtar goes all in without giving away an ounce of that in return for more grounded story. For which I am grateful.Stylistically this film is a work of art. Every frame is beautifully justified of that dreamt land. It is in a lot of sense a true musical. All the song set pieces are uniquely extravagant.This whole film is an evidence of Akhtar's mastery behind cameras.One of the few aspects that bogged down the film was the performance by the leading cast. The \"gang\" barring few members lacked chemistry.Nanda's performance as Archie is strangely unidimensional. He feels emotionally distant from his character. Khusi Kapoor's performance is good but alas she doesn't get time to shine. Surprisingly though the rest of the gang had performed really well. Suhana Khan's Veronica is impactful. Whereas Dot played the part exceptionally well.This is a really good movie for all those Archies fans who want to visit the world through a unique lens of Hindi cinema. You don't get opportunities like this too many times.",
    "139": "The film's musical tag is a misnomer; the music feels disjointed and fails to cohesively bind the narrative together. Instead of enriching the experience, it shatters the film into disparate pieces. The mix lacks the crucial essence of a musical, failing to create an illusion of live performance by the actors. It appears as though the sound emanates from a flat stereo file, depriving the scenes of authenticity and depth. The film attempts a musical, but the execution is painfully lacking.Moreover, the dubbing in the film, tarnishes the viewing experience. The audio sounds artificially produced, betraying any semblance of natural delivery. Indian cinema's persistent mishandling of microphone techniques during dubbing sessions and dialogue mix further magnifies this issue, detracting from the film's potential.Before venturing into complex genres like musicals, perhaps it's time to address fundamental technical aspects for a more immersive cinematic experience.",
    "140": "Wow, the Archies was a breath of fresh unpolluted air. After the wafer thin monstrosity, Animal it was great to see 2 back to back movies from woman directors - Meghna Gulzar with Sam Bahadur and Zoya with the Archies. The Archies had peaked my interest since it was announced; what would the setting be, what story would it have, how anyone can pull it off. An extremely difficult film to make - first take a comic book from the 60s and then bring it in to 2023 and make it relevant. To pull this off Zoya and team have done an amazing job! Can't believe how they pulled this off. This is so fresh, innocent fun and transports you to the 60s right away; you just get sucked in to the Archies world. Everything about this movie - the casting, the acting, the music, the songs, the cinematography, the choreography, the costumes, the locations, the dialogues are just wonderful. I can go on and on but do not want to give too many plot points; the messages conveyed through this movie are beautiful, so relevant today. All the leads have acted great, they are all so confident and I won't be surprised if they all go big! The supporting cast was great too!The only con is Netflix - why not the sweeping aspect ratio, Netflix? This is a film about outdoors and outdoors need CinemaScope and not your default aspect ratio. Sincerely hope Netflix corrects this or at least offers multiple aspect ratios so one can choose.Overall, a fantastic movie, not to be missed; I have already seen twice and would see more times - it was infectious and delicious. Take a bow, Zoya!",
    "141": "The musical film 'The Archies' delivers a captivating soundtrack that enhances the movie's overall experience. The songs, expertly composed and showcased on screen, contribute to the film's musical brilliance. The collaboration of talented music directors shines throughout.With stunning visuals and exceptional production design, the movie gains an extra layer of appeal. Setting the story in an Anglo-Indian town, inspired by the fictional American music band Archies, proves to be a clever choice.Debut performances by star kids Suhana Khan, Agastya Nanda, and Khushi Kapoor are commendable. Agastya Nanda particularly stands out, leaving a lasting impression despite limited screen time. Vedang Raina's brief appearance leaves a solid impact, while the ensemble cast, including Mihir Ahuja, Aditi Saigal, Yuvraj Menda, and others, delivers fine performances.In its second hour, 'The Archies' tackles a well-worn theme that could have been presented more engagingly, given its overuse in numerous nature-saving films. While the film features some bland scenes, the infusion of melodic songs and stunning visuals enhances the overall viewing experience. Unfortunately, predictability sets in, and the film's direction becomes evident.The emotional aspect deserves more attention, as the ending falls into the realm of the ordinary and clichéd. For musical films like 'The Archies,' a crisper execution is essential. The editing, regrettably, falls short, with an opportunity to trim approximately 10-15 minutes for a more streamlined experience.The retro vibes in 'The Archies' are skillfully crafted by music directors Shankar-Eshaan-Loy, Ankur Tewari, The Islanders, Aditi Saigal, and Jim Satya. Cinematographer Nikos Andritsakis captures aesthetically pleasing locales, complemented by superb production values. However, the editing falls short.While Zoya Akhtar impresses in a few scenes, her magical touch seems somewhat absent in 'The Archies.' Despite a promising premise, the execution lacks depth, resulting in a plain narrative. Fans of Akhtar's previous works may find 'The Archies' somewhat underwhelming.Overall, 'The Archies' is a passable musical with decent performances from star kids Suhana Khan, Agastya Nanda, and Khushi Kapoor. The film's strengths lie in superb songs and stunning visuals, yet the story and narration fall short. While there are some good moments, expectations for a better outing from Zoya Akhtar make the film just an okay watch.",

'The Archies' is a delightful exception-a breath of fresh air featuring genuine young actors, not seasoned veterans masquerading as (3) college kids. The film's plot mirrors reality, capturing authentic love stories without resorting to exaggerated theatrics.This cinematic venture stands out for its realism, devoid of the common pitfalls of today's films targeting urban teens. There's a palpable absence of abuses, vulgarity, profanity, and the pretentious personas often associated with such narratives. 'The Archies' chooses to embrace the sweetness of innocence, and if it had a middle name, it would undoubtedly be Betty.While the film is not without its flaws, they are easily forgiven in light of its daring attempt to provide something enjoyable for our teens. In a world where they grapple with various challenges, 'The Archies' emerges as a commendable effort, offering a positive narrative without compromising on relatability. It's a cinematic journey that resonates with the unspoken voice of today's youth.",
    "143": "The film \"Archis\" fails to deliver on multiple fronts, leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment and frustration. The storyline lacks coherence, meandering without a clear direction, and the characters are poorly developed, making it challenging for the audience to connect or empathize with them.The screenplay seems to prioritize style over substance, resulting in a visual spectacle that ultimately feels like empty aesthetics. The dialogue is often forced and clichéd, failing to engage the audience or add any depth to the narrative. The pacing is inconsistent, with moments of tedious stagnation followed by rushed and confusing sequences.Furthermore, the performances of the cast, including the lead, come across as uninspired and fail to breathe life into the characters. The film's attempt to convey a meaningful message or theme falls flat, as it lacks a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of its subject matter.In essence, \"Archis\" can be summarized as a disappointing cinematic experience, characterized by a lackluster plot, underdeveloped characters, and an overall absence of the storytelling prowess needed to make a lasting impact on the audience.",
    "144": "I have been reading Archie comics since I was a child so I am a little biased.The movie is fairly good. It does not have the spark that I thought it would have. I feel the newcomers were very self conscious and that affected their performances. When one thinks of Dimple Kapadia at the age of 14 in her first film Bobby or Jaya Bhaduri in her first film Guddi, these performances were very subdued.The cinematography was good and the music reasonably so.I felt Reggie played by Vedang Raina was the best of the lot.The parents were inconspicuous. There was nothing in their performances that singled them out. Maybe Mr Lodge was most noticeable.Pop Tate, such an important character was terribly underplayed.I wonder where it went wrong for the makers. This could have been such a spirited, lively film.Anyway, I am an Archie fan. I still read his comics. So I am rating it at 7/10.",

I'm a Goan and can relate to Anglo Indian community and the culture. This movie took me back in times. The reflection the backdrop this movie is set at 'soon after independence times' was refreshing.I also liked the simplicity.. it was nice to see a clean movie no cuss words etc, a family movie after a long time.. difficult to find that in current times.The set and location amazing.Disclaimer: everyone may not like this genre of movies. This definitely not the single screen types.",

The pacing was impeccable, allowing the story to unfold organically and keeping me on the edge of my seat.For anyone with a passion for the arts, this movie is a treasure trove.

    "147": "I started watching this movie without much hope, and just for Zoya Akhtar who happens to be one of my favourite directors after she delivered a stellar, surreal movie called Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara which I've watched over 15 times.With Netflix set to 1.5X speed, I started watching this movie, but quickly reset it to the normal speed due to the incredible soundtrack and set design-production quality.The music work along with the overall locale takes you back to a very warm feeling where you feel that this movie should be watched with a few family and friends on a cold winter weekend night, tucked in blankets and pillows. The song towards the end of the movie \"Yeh Saari Aawazein\" is the pinnacle of music composition - just gorgeous! This besides all other super talented music composers and musicians made the overall movie a good watch.A few minor negatives for me would be a bit of lackluster performance by a few (who have tried their best though), reduced character establishment - especially the love triangle between Archie, Betty and Veronica - without a definitive closure on their relationship, along with a superbly predictable storyline.That being said, it is definitely a refreshing watch that is different from the usual repetitive mainstream Bollywood movies which are all about a hero destroying the bad people with a heroine for garnish.I may or may not watch this movie again, but for sure will save the soundtrack on my Spotify library.",
    "148": "Just watched \"The Archies\" on Netflix.Things I loved:\n1. Fashion. The clothes were beautiful and really looked good on the characters. It was nostalgic!2. Whoever cast the actors did a good job! Everyone suited their roles, I felt.3. Loved loved loved Suhana! Veronica is so empowered and the way she's the heroin in her own world, I simply loved it for her!4. It was something different. Not your typical Bollywood movie. Zoya tried something different and I really appreciated it.Now the negatives:\n1. Started slow and if you haven't read the comics then you might not enjoy it as much.2. The music wasn't catchy, this film had a musical theatre vibe to it which means... The songs should be amazing. It was so-so.3. Since my bias lies in Psychological thriller films, I couldn't enjoy them as much.However, it is definitely a one-time watch! Kudos to the Zoya for trying something new!",
    "149": "\"The Archies\" unfolds with the charm of a small town, reminiscent of the innocence we often associate with classic tales. The ensemble of star kids, making their debut together, sparks initial curiosity, creating a vibe similar to the debut of another star-studded cast in SOTY. Yet, the true star of the show is Zoya Akhtar's vision, weaving a world that is sweet, uncomplicated, and refreshingly inviting. If given the chance, one might want to live in this idyllic town, cycling through its streets, lounging in the park, and simply being part of its wholesome atmosphere.The characters in Riverdale are endearing, with an innocence that shields them from being taken for granted. The surroundings, too, refrain from exploiting them, creating a narrative filled with sweetness, milkshakes adorned with ice cream scoops, and hearty hamburgers.While the cast, including the dazzling Suhana Khan, Agastya Nanda, and Khushi Kapoor, exudes real-life polish, their on-screen performances fall short at times. The dialogue delivery appears emotionless and uneven, with a tendency to trail off at the end of sentences, indicating a need for more training.Despite this, some characters shine brightly in their roles. Vedang Raina as Reggie Mantle, Ethel Muggs portrayed by Aditi Sehgal, and Yuvraj Menda as Dilton Doiley exhibit better polish and leave a lasting impact. Yuvraj, in particular, with his charming \"Thank you,\" adds a delightful touch to the narrative.The plot introduces a common conflict that lacks the depth to evoke genuine empathy. It feels like a safe choice, perhaps dictated by resource constraints, leaving the audience with a predictable resolution and a lack of emotional investment.Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music stands out as a highlight, delivering a refreshing blend of no-mix-match, unadulterated melodies. The trio's return is a treat, offering pure, fresh songs that enhance the overall viewing experience.In conclusion, \"The Archies\" is a one-time watch, conveniently available on Netflix. The film's strengths lie in its music, occasional cool moments, and Zoya Akhtar's ability to craft a pleasing narrative with minimal resources. While the cast may need more refinement, the movie succeeds in providing a feel-good experience for those seeking a simple and enjoyable escape."
