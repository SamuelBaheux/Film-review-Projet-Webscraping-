    "0": "GODZILLA MINUS ONE (2023) **** Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Sakura Ando, Yuki Yamada, Kuranosuke Sasake, Hidetaka Yaoshioka, Yuya Endo, Saki Nakatani. Director Takashi Yamazaki's Herculean efforts of reviving the Kaiju franchise is effortlessly awesome and absolutely top-tier filmmaking with the origin story of the gigantic monster showing up off the shores of post WWII Japan as it engages a full-tilt invasion of Tokyo and its environs with atypical destruction and death. Key to the film's strength is the plot involving ex-kamikaze pilot Kamiki (suffering arguably cinema's most poignant PTSD) and love interest Hamabe as a make-shift family attempting to survive with the thread of a palpable redemption narrative laced with surprisingly heartfelt emotion. The clean visual f/x propel the radioactive creature is jaw-droppingly astounding with some neat extras (his spiny back igniting as it re-charges its nuclear energies is eye-poppingly epic). One of the year's best films.",
    "1": "I would not call myself a huge Godzilla fan by any means and I mainly went to see this one at the urging of a friend. Holy heaven, I was so surprised by GODZILLA MINUS ONE. In a year where both of my most anticipated movies turned out to be crummy disappointments (BARBIE and NAPOLEON), this movie-- a film I had no initial plans of seeing and had little enthusiasm for going into it-- blew me away.Godzilla is actually terrifying in this. The post-WWII setting was well-realized, with the characters exhausted after years of violence, destruction, and struggle. The characters were all relatable and interesting-- unlike other Godzilla movies I've seen, I cared intensely about their fates and was emotionally invested in the little found family they formed. And thank God for the lack of ironic jokes undercutting emotional scenes-- after so many trash Hollywood movies, I didn't even know it was possible for a blockbuster to be sincere like this anymore.Most of all, I love how life-affirming this film is. The cautious but persistent optimism is such a breath of fresh air. About my only criticism is that the ending twist is a little hokey... but to be honest, I can forgive that. The movie is too good for me to complain about a happy ending.",
    "2": "From the opening to the ending, I was enthralled by the whole movie. It kept everything that I loved about Godzilla, and was able to make an extremely interesting backstory with the human characters. There was a lot of things that was addressed in this movie that I had never seen before.there was so many things that people will pick apart, but that's upon reflection. I had no criticisms or a reason to dislike this movie the whole time I watched it. So, in that respect, I will give it a perfect score. And I don't go slinging those out just every review. As a Godzilla fan, this was perfection to me.",
    "3": "Godzilla Minus One is an amazing spectacle on a retelling of a classic Kaiju movie from the prospective of a post-war Japanese veteran who leaves one horror for the next while making an arrangement of \"friends and family\" along the way. The story was so compelling that it didn't feel like two hours past and I was craving for more. The classic Godzilla sounds design, masterful cinematography, along with the original score from Akira Ifukube made this movie an absolute masterpiece on storytelling! The visuals of the Godzilla update made him more memorable and menacing for the citizens of a distraught Tokyo. Highly recommended!",
    "4": "Godzilla Minus One is one of the best Godzilla films in recent time. It gave me everything i wanted for the first time ever I was actually invested in the human characters and their story normally you are just waiting for Godzilla to show up but not here Godzilla shows up alot and when he does he is BRUTAL. This Godzilla makes things personal by actively attacking the humans. The movie had great pacing where it doesn't feel like it's going on for too long and it was nice to have a darker story set after WW2. It really goes back to the franchise's roots. There's so much to say but it would give a lot away JUST SEE THE MOVIE ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE 9/10.",
    "5": "After the brain cell killing abomination known as Godzilla vs. Kong, the monsterverse was ruined for me. I also found the movie Shin Godzilla to be kind of boring. I have yet to watch that movie and not fall asleep through it. So when I seen Godzilla Minus One, it blew me away. It is easily one of the best Godzilla movies out there. At least in the top 5. I'd honestly recommend this movie even if you're not a Godzilla fan. It is seriously that good. The humans were great in this movie. You really felt for them and can see how they got to their mindset. The effects were really good. It really looks like a guy is in a rubber suit, just like the good old days, but it is entirely CGI and with it being done on just a budget of 15 million dollars. There is no excuse for a 250 million dollar movie to look terrible when this movie made everything work with 15 times less of a budget. I am in no way interested in seeing Godzilla x Kong 2, but I would gladly see what Toho has in store for THEIR upcoming monster movie projects.",
    "6": "Finally a Godzilla movie with interesting and developed characters, for this point it's certainly the best of the franchise.(Spoiler part) I also thought the death of one particular character was really surprising... Well, until she suddenly turns out to be alive at the end, in order to allow a happy ending. Kind of ruined the meaning of the death for the main character and emotion part (as the title \"Minus One\" can have a meaning for Japan overall AND specificaly the main hero).The idea to set the story in the 40's Japan is also interesting, as a foreigner i really discovered this post-war period of the country that i didn't really know about (i only saw Kurosawa's \"Subarashiki nichiyobi\" prior to this movie).The actions sequences are also very cool. You definitively won't be disapointed with them. I loved the treatment of the King of the Monsters, who have an interesting design and new ability (both are kind of linked).I saw it in a casual cinema, but i guess the IMAX version is worth it, so go for it if you got the chance.",
    "7": "\"Godzilla is the son of the atomic bomb... ...He is a nightmare created out of the darkness of the human soul. He is the sacred beast of the apocalypse. As long as the arrogance of Man exists, Godzilla will survive...\" - David Kalat, author, \"A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series\"\"Godzilla Minus One\" is living proof that in the words of one viewer over on YouTube, you can re-tell the exact same story a dozen different ways and you can still produce an excellent end-product. Japan saw fit to reboot its long-running \"Godzilla\" series with \"Shin Gojira\" back in 2016, and has re-booted the franchise, yet again, with \"Godzilla Minus One,\" which was released in Japanese theaters on November 3rd, 2023, to mark the 69th anniversary of the film that started it all, Ishiro Honda's grim black & white \"Gojira\" (1954); \"Godzilla Minus One\" saw an American theatrical release today on December 1st, 2023, making it the first Japanese-produced \"Godzilla\" film to be released theatrically in the United States since \"Shin Gojira,\" which itself was the first Japanese-produced \"Godzilla\" film to be released domestically since \"Godzilla 2000\" (1999) (which as a tearful aside, was the last film I ever saw at the Cineplex Odeon at my local shopping mall before it closed down later that summer in 2000).As most readers here know, I am a life-long Godzilla fan; \"Gojira\" is my all-time favorite giant monster movie (and 1989's \"Godzilla vs. Biollante\" is my favorite giant monster \"versus\" movie and is a unique gem amongst giant monster movies and \"Godzilla\" movies, more specifically - I love it). When I had first heard that Toho was planning on releasing yet another kaiju-eiga (\"Japanese monster movie\") featuring the mighty \"King of the Monsters,\" I began to get really excited. (It's really hard for me to get excited about most new movies these days for a litany of reasons. More on this in a bit.) Of course, Toho was keen to keep the very specific details of the movie under wraps, which only made the anticipation greater. (I had experienced that same sensation of immense excitement when \"Shin Gojira\" received a one-week distribution stateside back in 2016, and I had to drive all the way to Washington, D. C., from my home in Northern Virginia, which is where the nearest theater playing the film was located.)As written and directed by visual effects specialist Takashi Yamazaki, \"Godzilla Minus One\" takes a huge creative leap with firmly established Godzilla lore by going back to the beginning. Well, not just going back to the beginning, but going back even FURTHER than when things first began with \"Gojira\" in 1954. Yamazaki's film opens during the closing days of World War II in Japan, and ends two years later in 1947 - seven years before Honda's original. We all know the story of how a fictional dinosaur species called a \"Godzillasaurus,\" which was living on a deserted island in the South Pacific Ocean after the Second World War, was then exposed to radioactive fallout from American nuclear weapons testing in the region, and how it later mutated into a gargantuan, seemingly indestructible fire-breathing beast that later attacked Japan - Gojira (\"Godzilla,\" in English).But right there, by setting \"Godzilla Minus One\" immediately after Japan's defeat in World War II and having Godzilla appear much sooner than he did in Ishiro Honda's original, Yamazaki's film stands apart from \"Gojira\" and it gives Yamazaki some new creative and dramatic territory to explore - in this case, how Japan, already at its lowest point after having surrendered to the Allies following the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945, must now contend with another looming disaster of unprecedented scale: an attack by a gigantic, radioactive, fire-breathing monster (or daikaiju, \"giant strange beast\").The story here focuses on Imperial Japanese Navy kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), who in the final days of WWII in 1945, lands on Odo Island after feigning that his plane is experiencing technical issues. He meets with the lead mechanic there, Sokaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), and during the night their camp is attacked by a giant dinosaur that comes ashore from the ocean and slaughters everyone except Shikishima and Tachibana, who comes to blame Shikishima for his hesitation at a critical moment which resulted in the deaths of all their comrades.Later that year after Japan's surrender, Shikishima, wracked with survivor's guilt, returns to Tokyo, which has been ravaged by Allied fire-bombing raids - raids that claimed the lives of both his parents. (As an aside, these scenes of a devastated post-war Tokyo have to be a visual reference to the eye-witness accounts given by Ishiro Honda himself after he'd been discharged from service overseas in the Imperial Japanese Army, and then toured Hiroshima on his way home following the city's atomic bombing, and he later used these experiences to form his vision of the character of Godzilla. And as a matter of fact, Yamazaki, as a visual effects artist, has a nice taste for shocking and unsettling imagery - the first sighting of the un-mutated Godzillasaurus, the actual first appearance of Godzilla at sea or the so-called \"black rain\" following the giant monster's later rampage on Tokyo, are some prime examples - which makes his film one of the more visually interesting \"Godzilla\" features ever produced.) While salvaging what little he has left, he meets Noriko (Minami Hamabe), another war orphan who carries in her tow, an infant girl named Akiko (Sae Nagatani), whose mother perished in the fire-bombing raids and had charged Noriko with the child's care. He allows the two of them to move in with him and a loose family of sorts is born.Pretty soon, however, Japan, which is only in the early stages of reconstruction (just at it was in \"Gojira\"), is threatened by the terror of Godzilla, who rises from the Pacific Ocean to unleash his wrath on a country that has already suffered heavy devastation brought on by nuclear bombers, and must now face a threat that could destroy the country completely. Since Japan cannot rely on its military (the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces were disbanded in 1945 following the surrender, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces - JSDF - weren't founded until July of 1954) or the United States (Japan would not begin to enter into a series of mutual security and cooperation legislative agreements with the U. S., and thus become our closest Asian ally, until the early 1950s) for aid - due to rising tensions with the Soviet Union - it is up to Shikishima and a few other dedicated private citizens to defeat Godzilla and protect what little country of theirs that is left to protect.\"Godzilla Minus One\" is a thrilling cinematic event the likes of which I have not experienced since, well, \"Shin Gojira.\" I should now state here that I rarely go to the movies anymore, as there just isn't much out there these days that truly interests me. Since superhero movies no longer carry the geeky thrill that they once did for this viewer, I found \"Godzilla Minus One\" to be a much-welcomed shot in the arm, and something very, very different from much of what I've seen lately. That it was a subtitled foreign-language feature that had received a wide distribution stateside (\"Godzilla 2000\" had a wide theatrical release back in 2000, while, as stated earlier, \"Shin Gojira\" only had a one-week engagement back in 2016), \"Godzilla Minus One\" lives up to its high expectations and by going in a different direction from the anti-bureaucratic satire of \"Shin Gojira\" and by extension the dark apocalyptic tone of \"Gojira,\" this makes it stand out from much of the fare that I've seen in recent years, and even other \"Godzilla\" films.What also makes \"Godzilla Minus One\" stand out is that it's a feature that is not steeped in nostalgia or purposeful throwbacks to the \"Godzilla\" films of yesteryear (most domestic so-called \"legacy\" features love doing that for eagle-eyed, dog-eared fans of the originals to compensate for a lack of originality). Yes, \"Godzilla Minus One\" does include some obligatory references to films past, including some familiar musical themes by the late Akira Ifukube, who also created Godzilla's signature roar in the original 1954 \"Gojira\" and who remained Japan's most esteemed composer until his death in 2006. But this film is not about an avid fan-boy geeking out and showing off his hero-worship of the material. No, \"Godzilla Minus One\" is simply a tale of a country trying to pick itself up again following the end of a devastating conflict - a conflict that nearly destroyed the nation - and having to face a force of nature more dangerous and destructive than any war. That is perhaps where Takashi Yamazaki succeeds the most, and his film is also not steeped in the usual anti-American resentment and finger-pointing and anti-nuclear allegory, and - and! - the assertive pro-Japanese nationalist sentiment of most recent \"Godzilla\" movies (a more recent phenomenon that has been pervasive in many \"Godzilla\" features since the early 1990s, after Japan had fully rebuilt its economy and was looking to re-assert itself on the global market).\"Godzilla Minus One\" is a \"Godzilla\" film that was well worth the seven-year wait.\"Godzilla Minus One\" rates a solid \"10.\"10/10.",
    "8": "LIKES:The Story:\n-You might not care if there is a plot for a monster movie, but in this film the plot actually holds more soul than the ones from most monster-verse flicks.-Centered on a good character with lots of struggles, Yamazaki has blended cultural traditions with an engaging character and given me a human I like.-Godzilla may be the namesake, but Shikishima is a great character whose story mirrors the further revelation of the beast. And I really enjoyed this gradual evolution of plot and character development.-The evolution of handling Godzilla felt like Jaws almost, gradually pushing to an epic finale that feels climactic and in character with the film.The Writing:\n-It's not the most unique or amazing writing, but again, it's real, raw, and fitting for the tone of the movie.-Minus One has lines that really match the expectations of post-war Japan, moving alongside the main character's part in life and gradually matching it to feel approachable and believable.-There was natural comedy built in to liven things up, mixed well with more dramatic writing that matches the dramas on Netflix and other streaming platforms.-And to even give that science fiction feeling as well, but never getting lost into what feels like a theoretical physics book, aces in my books for making things moving well.The Pacing:\n-There are slow parts to this film, but they are fewer than I anticipated, only getting lost in the sullen times to help with building up the next act.-Instead, the movie surprisingly works in how it again builds up the characters around the big monster, pitting man vs. Beast in another battle for survival.-Despite being heavily centered on human, Minus One is a plus on just how well it keeps things moving, with most of the 125 minute run time flying by for me well.-Moving fast enough to balance characters and monster time to give enough of both, and yet not so fast that all this attempts at character development have been a waste.The Acting:\n-It's good in regards to the feel of the movie for me, somehow delivering strong lines despite me not understanding a lick of Japanese.-Kamiki's acting is solid, feeling one part real-life anime meets epic monster performance. He's got his emotions under control for the most part, though the crying is a little forced and fake sounding. Still, facial expressions and character acting are solid, good details to help show the burden on his mind and make me resonate with his struggles.-Ando is fine for the time she is on screen. Her opening acts are stellar for delivering those key line moments, but she doesn't get enough screen time to really maximize the full motion I think she could have brought.-Hamabe on the other hand has plenty of time, and she was probably the best of the bunch in terms of elegant balance, beautiful delivery with poetic phrasing, and just a touch of emotional explosion when needed. Such a great dynamic she established with just about every character.Godzilla:\n-The beast is a design to pay tribute to the original beast that got this all started. His movement, frame, and face are all sculpted to the classic rubber suit and a fan like me loved it.-The modern day graphics help add better texture, fluid movement, and some added features to help give him that deadlier edge we've grown accustomed to.-His movement has organic anatomy to it, but on land that classic gait of being sort of bloated and hindered worked amazingly for me and again a nice little nod to the fanbase.-And when action emerges, it's got that feeling of classic monster movie moments, but again having that edge of modern cinema to bring you into the movement. The way Godzilla reels to damage, the way he moves to maximize damage, and even the water moments are epic in that Jaws like manner.-throw in some other tricks that CGI makes easier to achieve, and the Godzilla really does have a few more tricks that this \"realistic\" approach did well.The Action:\n-Is it the best action moments I've seen? No, I won't lie that there is more that could have been done.-Yet, the movie accomplishes again that classic monster fight, where humanity fights this gargantuan monster and has to find the secret to beating it.-I loved the gradual approach to tackling Godzilla's wrath, the battlefields chosen, the planning, the adaptation, and again graphic work to help things come together.-Add the story investments, the stakes, and again this multiangle approach to bring everyone into the fray was stellar and it accomplished an action scene I was more invested in than many modern action movies.The Cinematography:\n-By far, the movie has the presentation to help add all that extra flair to the movie, helping it stand alone from what the American cinema does.-The filters on the camera alone just add so much, one part old time feel to the decade, but yet still has that sheen to keep the realism high.-Under strong direction, the crew uses great editing to help add great texture, emotion, with sad shadows of darkness during the heavier moments, and that gorgeous blue yellow and golden light during the moments of revering.-And then to pick a bunch of unique angles to give you the full effect of the chaotic moments. You'll get epic destruction from various points of views, wide shots of Godzilla seeming to choose his next target, and fast paced movement that keeps you more engaged than the static images do.-It all matches together in this artistic twist to the rather unartistic movie, and perhaps makes this movie stand out more than anything from most of the other predecessors.DISLIKES:Subtitles:\n-More a warning than a dislike, if you don't want to read your movie, then learn Japanese or avoid the film.-Those who don't want to keep up with faster reading, or might fall asleep, are going to struggle a bit with this movie, and you might find the acting a tad diluted because of it.More Time With Characters:\n-So many promising characters and only so much time to get them, Godzilla Minus One accomplishes much, but just doesn't use all the characters to the same light.-Several secondary characters that have promise and use are sort of dropped and forgotten, only randomly appearing at random times.-These side stories and character arcs hold so much potential, and then again hastily get wrapped up, and are the weaker aspects of the story.-And when it comes to one member of the family, I can't say that it was the best use, or need of a little kid compared to what they were trying to accomplish with her.-A shame given the potential, but it's bearable given the characters we do get are done so well.More Action:\n-No surprise here, the movie needed to hike the action up a tad more and give me one sequence or more to the final sequence to show that desperate fight.-More coordination with the military? Or maybe more time with the characters we are knowing to face the rampage could have gone a bit farther for me.-I wanted to have that epic build up and some failure, and really push it so the characters might not make it, which the final battle is building to it, but there is just more that could have been done for me.-Perhaps even having Godzilla's intelligence show a bit more like they were doing could have been added as well, to really give that intense war chess I like in movies.-Though fortunately, we still have more time and involvement with Godzilla than we did for a lot of the first movie.The VERDICT:Godzilla Minus One proves you can blend artistic style and popular movies together and freshen things up. The presentation is solid, great camera work being the lead to pull this movie together and accomplish much in this new start. Solid sound editing and great visual effects only further take this monster movie to larger heights, and brought the attitude that they needed. The Japanese cast brings a top notch performance, helping liven up fantastic dialogue and make this story feel deeper and more personable than others, putting the American stories to shame. And to bring all this together with just good character development and meshing action and story between human and beast... well it really impressed me more than I thought it would. Sure the pacing is a bit off at times, some characters get the shaft and there is more that can be done, but Minus One is a solid entry int eh Godzilla empire that I look forward to watching it again or seeing if it takes off. Most of those wanting monster mashing and monster vs. Monster, need to wait for the next entry in that universe, but for those wanting a good Jaws like movie, catch this one in theater for the best experience in my opinion.My Scores are:Action/Adventure/Drama: 8.0-8.5\nMovie Overall: 7.5-8.0.",
    "9": "PROS:\n-Godzilla is TERRIFYING!!!-Human characters you actually care about.-The boat chase sequence!!!-The soundtrack is God-Tier.-Godzilla's Atomic Breath!!!-Strong Anti-War message.-Godzilla's Ginza Attack sequence!!!-All the actors give strong performances.-The Entire 3rd Act!!!CONS:\n-It had to end.This is how Godzilla is done!!! This is the closest Toho has come to matching the original film. Director Takashi Yamazaki just made a new class of Godzilla film. Themes of forgiveness, survivors' guilt, PTSD, family and learning that life is a gift are all touched on here. The story of Shikishima and Noriko is full of heart, and you genuinely care about the family unit they form, which ultimately guts your heart when the King of the Monsters arrives. I teared up more than once. Godzilla is a true villain here. He's a devastating force that's here to claim Japan as his own and this film shows his power like never before. Every foot fall is felt, his tail swipe crushes buildings, his atomic breath levels everything in its path. I've never been more terrified of Godzilla than I was here. The soundtrack by Naoki Sato is perfect and the use of the Ifukube theme was amazing. The special effects are great, and the cinematography is glorious. If you've ever been a Godzilla fan or are curious why people like these movies, watch this film!!! This is a perfect example of what a Godzilla film should be!!! 10/10.",
    "10": "Everything that involves a classic, Japanese Godzilla movie, tied together with square enix effects and.modern day writing. The story takes you back to the roots of Godzilla, and even gives you glimpses into how he develops into the Godzilla you see later.For those that know the history of Japan's development of Godzilla, there's a lot of subtle jabs at world war 2, government cover up, and American impact on their society at the end of the war. Just a nice amusing side note for those interested.Absolutely loved this movie. I haven't been this excited to watch it again immediately after since Godzilla 2000. Just amazing! I can't wait to see what they do next in developing the real Godzilla story!",
    "11": "Wow, the emotional depth in this Godzilla movie is unparalleled! It delves into the lives of characters deeply affected by post-World War II circumstances in Japan. The narrative revolves around a kamikaze pilot, a woman coping with loss, and a foundling. Godzilla's looming threat adds a gripping layer, making you root for the characters' survival. The studio crafts a remarkable atmosphere, skillfully balancing storytelling and showcasing efforts to halt Godzilla's devastation. What's truly impressive is the film's emotional impact, avoiding clichés and delivering a serious, impactful narrative. The actors' performances are powerhouse, elevating the movie to an awesometacular level!",
    "12": "Without spoiling anything, this movie hit different from any other. It felt much more serious and quite a bit darker at times. The movie was amazing, the effects were great. I never thought I'd see a Godzilla movie where people were crying in the theater. It was quite the experience. Godzilla was truly an unstoppable force in this movie, whenever Godzilla would show up it was hard to feel anything but futility. Even in the rare event that Godzilla was injured he was only slowed down. This version of Godzilla might be more evil than Shin Godzilla though his motives are hard to understand where shin Godzilla it became apparent.",
    "13": "Look I'm gonna be honest here, when it comes to monster movies they are a guilty pleasure. However in the recent years they really haven't been all that good. In particular Godzilla movies specifically the American ones. Now don't get me wrong they have great cgi and some cool fight scenes but, the boring plot of pointless human characters annoyed me so much that I just turned off the movies halfway through. I walked into this movie with some expectations that I was sure were not gonna be met.... Boy oh boy was I wrong . This film not only is a good movie BUT is also one the best \"monster\" movies I've seen. It's a return to form for the franchise with surprisingly great results. It also did something that I did not think it could do,It took the human characters and made you care about them. The setting is perfect , the pacing is good, the movie respects your time and knows what you wanna see. Godzilla's design and presence is down right intimidating just as much as it is terrifying. Whatever team did the sound design also should be giving props because ....damn it's good. I can't tell you how much fun and enjoyment I had watching this. I leave you with this if your a Godzilla fan it's a must watch , if your a monster movie fan(like me) it's a must watch. Or if your new to the franchise and want to see why this is such a iconic character well strap in, buckle up, cause you are in for one hell of a ride.",
    "14": "Godzilla is back and is better than ever! This film is one of the best to date and is a personal favorite of mine. If you are a fan or new to Godzilla, I recommend this movie 100% and the visuals and CGI looked amazing. The CGI in this film is the best for any TOHO Godzilla film and even looks as good as the Hollywood Godzilla films for only a fraction of the budget! Overall, this is a perfect Godzilla movie to me and really takes him back to his roots to being a frightening force of nature/result of atomic weapons and is really a step up for the franchise in a long time. Long live the king!!!",
    "15": "After watching this Godzilla it has become clear to me that he is meant to represent the trauma and destruction of the atomic bomb. He is essentially an atomic bomb incarnate.The full scale destruction, fear, fire, and radiation are all exactly the same you would expect from an atomic bomb. He shows up to totally destroy cities killing as many as possible then leaves it uninhabitable after. Japan was the only country to experience the atomic bombs and made Godzilla as a way to show this experience in a form people could connect with.All I could think of when we saw what Godzilla was capable of is \"wow this must be what an atomic bomb must be like.\" Very moving and something no one could ever forget. Thank you Japan for creating such a masterpiece.",
    "16": "Set at the end of World War 2 and Japan is defeated and in ruins. Our protagonist is Koichi, a pilot who returns to his devastated hometown in Tokyo. He is unwelcome and guilt ridden for sneaking out of a kamikaze raid in the pacific. Japan is at its lowest point and then Godzilla arrives.This is a brilliant setup for this period story that sees a country without the military might, technology and morale to face this new enemy. The film also leans into the drama and emotion that made the first film so iconic and sets it apart from the family fun films of the 70s and 80s as well as the recent American blockbuster treatments. My Japanese is not good enough to understand all of the film so there will be lots that I didn't get. However it manages to be a strong, emotional story with a scary and ferocious Godzilla. In my mind it is far superior to Shin Godzilla which I found dull and goofy. This is the best Godzilla film in many years and perhaps the best since the 1954 original.",
    "17": "This is the best Godzilla movie ever made. Sure the action sequences were great, but the story of the characters made you really care about them, so even without Godzilla on screen, you stay interested. And while a book could be written about this, the movie takes place in a defeated and ruined Japan right after World War II, and watching the remnants of the Japanese Imperial Navy on a mission for good (as opposed to their mission during the war) will allow Japanese viewers to enjoy the bravery shown by its WW2 era Navy. Something they probably have not been able to do for historical reasons. (Complicating this thought is the lead character suffering from PTSD due to the war.)The cinematography was excellent. While it's always enjoyable to watch The Big G stomping around, there are scenes that recall its earlier movies, music from the 1954 original, and excellent flying scenes around Godzilla in the penultimate battle. But again, it's the characters and their relationships that give meaning to this film.",
    "18": "This is something else. Not just a story of humongous monster that feels at home in the sea and on land. This is a human story, friendship, failure bend into succes. From me it succeeded in drawing tears, for the human aspect, feelings of loss and failing to accomplish anything. But also the resolve in the greatest danger, finding your place. A great example of how to move reluctant men to do what must be done, without pressure, but from morality, the right thing to do. Values we see too few in films nowadays. Here duty is mixed with friendship, acknowledging men's real mastery of crafts or science. Clearly presented: we need thinkers and doers. And maybe even a hero, the individual that makes the difference. I really loved this version, so much even that I'm going to see it again.",
    "19": "2014's Godzilla looked very impressive, with great sound and impressive visuals, etc., but it was missing a crucial element: interesting HUMAN characters. I found myself not caring anything about the people in it. This movie rectifies that. Sure, it has plenty of Godzilla monster action, showing him stomping on Tokyo, chomping on people, destroying ships, and using his atomic breath, but this time, it's not just empty spectacle. He's threatening and interacting with people we care about. It's a very personal story. The original was a powerful anti war film, portraying Godzilla as a metaphor for atomic weapons. I see this movie more as a metaphor for Japan coming to terms with WWII. The final line of dialogue emphasizes this.",
    "20": "Thsi is an amazing film.Godzilla is a terrifying monster in this one, the human drama is palpable, and setting the film in 1945-47 postwar Japan is a stroke of genius. Even better than SHIN GODZILLA -- the time it really feels real. Sound effects are incredible. Even better: the marshall music hearkens back to Toho monster movies of old.Wharever you do see this in a real theater with good projection and good sound; it's going to be hard to duplicate this in a home theater. Also, we don't often see human drama reflect the domestic human drama based on Japanese war experience.This one is going to be hard to beat.",
    "21": "Godzilla Minus One is the best Godzilla movie ever made. It's so well made, it deserves to sweep the Oscar's. It's so good, that you will rediscover lost filmmaking in this. They may not make films like that anymore in America, but leave it to the Asians to rediscover that magic.The film focuses on a kamikaze pilot who freaked out seeing Godzilla and his crew ends up killed. He ends up finding love and a baby and Godzilla returns. It's just an emotional journey with an incredible pay off.Currently, the film has been extended its theatrical run and I encourage the world to go see it. This will be my last film of the year and what a film to go out on. Best film in years!",
    "22": "This movie is like Hollywood's rendition of Godzilla, but 10 times better. Godzilla may be ten times smaller in this movie, but also ten times more imposing, the movie immediately shows us what this creature is capable of. The first half of this film is used to show what will happen if Godzilla isn't stopped. And how hard it will be to do that. Godzilla is often showed from below, so despite his smaller size, Godzilla is a gigantic threat. His atomic breath is more destructive and really makes it feel like an atomic bomb goes off every time he uses it.The characters in this movie are amazing, every character gets as much time and development as they deserve, the minor characters don't get a lot of attention, but enough to make you care about them and to explain why they're doing what they're doing. None of the characters act inhumane and everyone does what you would expect from them. This is truly the best rendition of Godzilla I have ever seen.",
    "23": "Godzilla: Minus One (2023)(10/10): I managed to get myself to the theatre this weekend to see the newest entry in the Godzilla Canon that is celebrating Godzilla's 70th anniversary, and happy birthday Godzilla, you sure know how to celebrate.Made by Toho the company that created Godzilla, the film is more true to the monsters roots than any of the American films but it marks a major shift for Godzilla as it is the first period piece Godzilla film and not only that but the film is a huge leap in terms of its storytelling as they were more giant monster mashes that had a story but it wasn't why one would be watching.FROM HERE ON I'M DIVING INTO SPOILER TERRITORY SO YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.Godzilla: Minus One takes place back in the World War Two era where we find our main character, Koichi, who is a Kamikaze fighter pilot that went rogue and landed on an island in hopes of surviving the upcoming battle that night Koichi notices fish that have died and rose to the surface and floated ashore and then the small base begins to feel a large quake and then when the spotlight turns on a large dinosaur like creature is revealed.They believe it to be the long rumoured beast Godzilla, a monster who comes from the sea that causes fish to die and rise to the surface and then leaves nothing but destruction in its wake.Being as the base is only small and not meant for battle, Koichi is ordered to sneak over to his place and fire his guns, but he freezes and eventually the monster is angered and kills everyone at the base, with the only two living being Koichi and the man who had ordered him to shoot.Eventually Koichi returns home now stricken with the guilt of many deaths he could've possibly prevented, but he then finds himself then suffering from more guilt as the city is destroyed by the war with thousands of lives lost, even his parents.He is one day at the market built from the rubble of the city when a mysterious woman being pursued by authorities gives him a baby, he decides to take it home as he couldn't just leave her alone and then is greeted by the woman who handed him the baby as she explains that she was orphaned and her parents told her to watch over her.Koichi decides to let them stay with him and then they raise the child themselves, however Koichi is still not able to accept that he is now the child's father with the memories that haunt him and make him refuse to let anyone in.He gets a job on a small ship that is designed for the destruction of mines and is eventually forced into the battle against his inner demon when he is confronted with the reality that Godzilla is far from gone and both US and Soviet forces have already decided that they are not aiding in this fight.His crew are sent out into the waters where they soon realize that they are acting as a diversion to distract Godzilla while larger ships are on their way as Godzilla is heading towards Tokyo when they see a huge naval ship that had been destroyed something that no weapon or large sea animal could do.They also realize that the enemy has most likely gotten much larger since the attack on the island two years ago when a much larger amount of fish rise to the surface.They are then confronted by a massive behemoth of a monster and they're only armed with a mounted machine gun and two mines, they manage to detonate the first one to no avail and as they detonate the second in Godzilla's mouth they are then faced with the threat that he has the ability to regenerate from wounds.Luckily they are saved by the arrival of the naval forces, or so they think as Godzilla quickly makes mincemeat of the heavy artillery and blows them off the face of the earth with his newly acquired atomic breath.Waking in a hospital Koichi is then immediately determined to have the government inform the public of the oncoming threat yet they refuse and he heads home and is eventually put in the position where he has to tell his companion of all the things that torment him and he is even restored of his hope for a normal life again.A couple days later the city is thrown into chaos as Godzilla ensues destruction upon the city and Koichi is then forced to run into the fray to save his companion yet once Godzilla annihilates the entire city with his atomic breath she sacrifices herself for Koichi and pushes him out of the way of all the shrapnel.Koichi now devastated is furious and fueled by vengeance, his colleagues come to him with a plan for killing Godzilla once and for all, and they are wondering if he was interested in attending the meeting to pitch the idea to the remaining civilians as the armed forces have since stated they are no longer planning to retaliate against the beast.They are now aware that Godzilla cannot be killed by conventional means so they will instead be using the remaining naval ships to deploy canisters that will cause the water to bubble and then make Godzilla sink, they intend to execute it in the deepest part of the ocean in their territory and distract Godzilla long enough to loop the canister around him and then once tied up activate the canisters and force Godzilla down as far as possible as fast as possible so that he suffers from the effects of intense pressure and as a backup have floatation devices attached to then make him rise fast enough to succumb to more pressure, but Koichi has something he feels is necessary, he needs a plane so he can serve as bait just in case Godzilla doesn't pass through those waters.He contacts the man from the island and manages to convince him to get an old fighter plane up and running, and even equipping it with a bomb on the inside as a last resort for him to kamikaze into Godzilla's mouth with an active bomb.Koichi leaves his daughter behind in the care of a trusted friend and is ready to make his sacrifice and be able to put his demons to rest, but will they succeed? What will happen to Koichi?Well that was a mouthful, but it is something that a Godzilla has been lacking up until now, a full character arc and an engaging human story.First off I must say that Godzilla looks phenomenal, I love everything about his new design and biology as well as the effects which were fantastic, hands down best digital effects and CGI I have seen in the longest time, and it was all in the approach to it.Godzilla looks more like his original design where it was a man in a suit, but they took that look and touched it up with modern technology that then made him have more fluid movement.Also Godzilla looks so good that he puts CGI in modern Hollywood to shame as he actually looks real, like legitimately terrifying at some points, I especially found the scenes in the water where Godzilla was chasing the small boat and we get a good look at his face for the first time, but all scenes were pulled off very well and made Godzilla frightening as well as awesome.I did find myself conflicted with rooting for Godzilla or the people, because it feels so satisfying to see the destruction unfold yet the characters are incredibly strong and compelling that you feel their pain, especially Koichi, who made me cry more than once.The new Godzilla design, I forgot that, so like I said it was primarily if not all CGI and it looks phenomenal, and the look of Godzilla is reminiscent of the original design but with more detail and some added biological elements that make Godzilla feel even more powerful than before.First is the regeneration which I had mentioned before but there's more to it than just regeneration, he is more susceptible to damage from the inside than the outside as much of the damage sustained from the outside is brushed off quickly. The Atomic Breath also gets a bit of an upgrade as Godzilla begins to glow blue starting from the end of his tail making it's way up to the back of his neck as each of his plates protrude a bit more as they glow as well but what really is the newest aspect is that the beam is thin and is almost like firing a sniper rifle except for the fact that the damage is the literal equivalent of an atomic bomb, Mushroom Cloud, fallout and completely irradiating the ground zero for the target, however his regeneration plays into his Atomic Breath as it's so powerful Godzilla even suffers damage from it and has to rest and regenerate.I also like the approach of going back to where it all started, as an allegory for the Atomic Bomb dropped during World War Two, even making it set in the forties makes the threat that much stronger, especially with the newly added abilities.I would say that it could use more Godzilla but that would only be true if the human story was not engaging, so I am actually satisfied with the amount of screen time that Godzilla has.Now I hope you're watching Hollywood, and you best take notes as Japan knows how to make a monster movie, because they have been doing it for seventy years.Godzilla: Minus One is a contender for not only best Godzilla film, but could very well be a contender for best monster movie.Seventy Years Later and you still haven't lost your touch, Happy Birthday Godzilla!",
    "24": "Having come from the theater just 15 minutes ago, Minus one isn't just a good Godzilla movie, but a good movie movie. Unlike in the Hollywood movies the story is filled with drama, emotions and makes you care for the protagonists. It talks about PTSD and japanese recovery from WW2 which humanizes the Japanese as not just the \"bad guys\". Instead of having some random dude in the military named John who's plopped into action and merely serves as a bag of flesh, minus one builds characters and makes you care. And all that on a 15 million budget, Its easily my 2nd favorite movie this year, maybe my favorite.",
    "25": "Just watched the early release in IMAX. This movie is a masterpiece. It is one of the rare movies where I felt a true emotional connection to the human characters. Often in a Godzilla film you want more Godzilla and less of the \"plot humans\", but this movie hit the perfect balance. This is a movie about family, about the value of life, and returns Godzilla back to its serious origins. The effects are also a spectacle, never have I seen such a clear view at Godzilla and have him move in such an organic way. A monstrous Godzilla paired with a somber and beautiful plot. There has never been a better Godzilla film in theater.",
    "26": "Just saw this at a theater in Missouri. Great movie! Was not expecting the human drama to be so good. You actually care about the characters and root for them as they tackle their own personal issues...and the setting being in 1945-47 was a very good idea too. Some nice surprises toward the end of the movie with these people and things becomes very emotional. Yup, it's a new kind of monster movie. When Godzilla finally appears in Toyko...watch out...it's terrifying. Awesome special effects and menacing sounds. Your put right in the middle of the \"battlefield\" as he rips this city to shreds. Could have used some more of that...that's why I give it a 9 instead of a 10.",
    "27": "There are very few films out there that culminate in a conclusion that delivers in a strong emotional way from a simple line, and that film is Godzilla Minus One.I'm not gonna lie. I am very surprised by this one, and I'm especially surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did. For starters, if you know me, then you know I do not care for foreign films. But after hearing about this one, I was intrigued, I like Godzilla, and this movie is getting nothing but positive scores and reviews. I must say that after watching it, those scores and reviews are absolutely justified!So Legendary Pictures, Warner Brothers, get your notepad out and take notes because this is how you do a good monster movie!To begin this review, I will say Godzilla is much more than a good monster movie. It's just a great film in general. It has a great story with a lot of emotion and depth that I would never have anticipated from a Godzilla film. It has tremendous character driven moments that I again would never have anticipated. Great writing, phenomenal visuals, and great acting. To give an example of how great these characters were and how well written they were I was genuinely so invested that I would at times forget about Godzilla and when he did show up to destroy everything I was crushed! I had genuine concern and emotion for these characters.Then, to drive this all home, I'm a huge World War II history nerd, so to see the Japanese post-war perspective was truly an eye-opening experience. Now, I have a craving for a WWII film set in the Pacific theater of the war from the Japanese point of view.Finally, I must mention the fantastic production value of this film. With a small budget of $15 million, I was blown away, especially with the visual design of Godzilla. It's just more proof that big budgets don't make for great cinema but actually caring about your work.So if you are maybe like me in having skepticism about the massive acclaim this film is receiving, well set them aside because without a doubt, Godzilla Minus One is one of the best films of the year.IMDb: 9/10\nLetterboxd: 4/5Watched in Theaters.",
    "28": "... you will love this movie! Felt like an anime live action. Great story at the heart of this entry into the Godzilla canon. Added plus that you don't waste half the movie waiting to see the monster. If you can, see it in a theater, IMAX even better! You won't be sorry. It has everything you want in a classic \"monster movie\" from thrills to love to revenge, plus great effects. I can't decide if I liked the scenes on land more than I like the scenes set at sea, but this movie has something for everyone. The only reason I'm not giving it a 10 is it probably ran about 15 minutes longer than it needed to be, but now I'm nitpicking. Catch it before it's too late.One more thing: Tragedy if this doesn't get a nom for Best Sound/Sound Editing.",
    "29": "I have never been a fan of the Godzilla movies. I have seen only one other: Godzilla King of the Monsters. From my observation, the modern Godzilla movies don't tend to be very good, but I honestly can say exactly since I haven't seen most of them. This one, however, is pretty effective. Not only does it have effective Godzilla action scenes, but the characterization is handled pretty well, which (I think) makes it stand out above all the other Godzilla films. I also like how this movie was tied to the aftermath of World War 2 and I definitely see some symbolism with the monster representing nuclear warfare. I also think it's appropriate that the movie takes place in Japan, the location of the original film. This movie isn't perfect - some character moments felt cheesy and contrived at times, especially towards the end. But this was still a good time.",
    "30": "I saw Godzilla Minus One, starring Ryunosuke Kamiki-Ghost Book, Last Letter; Minami Hamabe-Shin Kamen Rider, Murder at Shijinso and Munetaka Aoki-Independence of Japan, True Mothers.This is a prequel Godzilla movie to the 1954 original-It takes place right after WW2. Ryunosuke is a Kamikaze pilot that doesn't want to die, so he lands on a refueling island, claiming mechanical problems. Munetaka is the head mechanic on the island. Godzilla emerges from the ocean-looking like a baby Godzilla-and destroys the base killing everyone except Ryunosuke and Munetaka. There is a little bad blood between the 2 survivors, since Munetaka is an engineer, he knows there was nothing wrong with the plane and deduces Ryunosuke is a coward. Once Ryunosuke is back in Tokyo, he meets Minami, a homeless woman with a child, and takes them into his home to take care of them. Godzilla attacks again but he is bigger and badder-his dorsal fins light up and he develops his fire breath-so Ryunosuke wants to make up for his previous cowardice and destroy the monster. They went with CGI here and it looks pretty good. The only qualm I have is the screen time for Godzilla is not enough. I always like to read the end credits for music and other things like scenes but there isn't any scene at the end of this one. You do get to hear Godzilla's foot steps and hear his roar but it's totally in the dark.It's rated PG-13 for violence and action and has a running time of 2 hours & 5 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",
    "31": "One of the best if not the best movie this year. Finally a movie that was actually entertaining and fun to watch and rewatch a few times. Despite Hollywood's best efforts to destroy the entertainment industry and strangulate fun at the movies by spending billions of dollars on movies nobody wants and consequently watches, this low budget movie is a masterpiece that deserves every award out there. In comparison to Marvel and the rest of the Disney ilk, this movie is absolutely world class. Even if you are not into Godzilla, this movie is great because of the actors who play real people you care for instead of idiot hires.",
    "32": "Yes, a Godzilla movie really is a candidate for the best film of the year. Godzilla Minus One is the best Godzilla movie of all time and even surpasses the original. This is more than a Godzilla movie, it is an examination of the human condition and humanity's effect on the natural world and the natural world's response as was the case with the original 1954 classic. In many Godzilla movies, the creature is cartoonish at best. Not this Godzilla. The monster is the best and most fearsome Godzilla of all-time. Although it does cover the post-war period in Japanese history as the original did, Godzilla Minus One takes a different approach to the story. This film should be nominated, if not win, the Oscar for Best Picture. If it is not nominated at least, the Academy should be rightfully criticized and criticized harshly for their choice.",
    "33": "This is definitely a highlight of the year, being a welcome return for one of the biggest and most popular blockbuster franchises, and, in many ways, a return to form and its roots.Say what you will about the Hollywood versions of Godzilla, but there's a special charm to the original Japanese franchise, whether its the more relatable struggle about nuclear disaster, or a bit of campiness and coziness. This film definitely delivers in every regard without going overboard in one direction.The effects are great, incredible cinematography, cutting and editing - stellar CGI and practical effects, for sure - and some breathtaking action set pieces.The characters are very good, memorable, and well acted, very fitting in the narrative -and invoking some of the feeling from the original Godzilla, being more slow paced and character driven.Overall, definitely a great tribute and revitilization, in the vein of Top Gun Maverick or The Force Awakens. Great celebration for Godzilla fans, and film fans!",
    "34": "Every single Hollywood filmmaker take note. This is what a blockbuster film looks like. No goofy comedy. They treated the topic seriously because the plot was serious.

The Godzilla film we all deserved and will love. The ending was so dramatic you felt it would have gone differently. Side note: the subtitles were clear and did not blend or get washed into the background. Best Godzilla movie I've ever watched. Better than Shin Godzilla and that film was stupendous. A+!",
    "35": "First, a little disclaimer-the Americans and their version of Godzilla (I'm American) should be embarrassed. This movie is a perfect mesh of Kaiju and human drama. From beginning to end, it is a great movie. The Godzilla represented is the fiercest, most menacing since Godzilla's turn in Godzilla vs King Ghidorah back in 1990. The story which begins with a pilot who abandons his Kamikaze mission only to begin a downward spiral that carries his character through the rest of the film. The introduction and later mutation of Godzilla are handled brilliantly. This Godzilla is terribly scarred and has a secret which is amazing and I won't give away. He's also, for all his later bulk, fast. I could say more but I don't want to spoil it in any way. Just a great movie.",
    "36": "Not just a Godzilla flick this is an excellent story with superb acting and engaging emotion. Skillfully utilizing the 15 million dollar budget to present a spectacle easily rivaling American blockbusters costing many times more. For once the human story sucks us in and hold us emotionally throughout the mayhem that is terrifying and scary. Godzilla is a monster completely evil, fierce and unstoppable. A Godzilla not seen since tha 1954 original. This period piece ( immediately post WW2 ) presents as a shattered nation. It at once gives the viewer a sense of realism and perhaps the first \"what if\" story we can easily enter because it is Japan as it was with real circumstances and real people. It is one of the best pictures of the year easily in the top five. See it on the big screen as it was meant for a transformative experience.",
    "37": "Set in post World War II Japan, this movie delivers an outstanding balance between the death and destruction that the viewer expects from Godzilla himself, but giving us a drama filled story and fully realized character arcs of love, sacrifice, servitude and redemption.The outstanding special effects add to a great story, the camera angles put you right in the middle of the action, the characters are real and the scenes are well acted. I loved the soundtrack, especially the climactic battle score and want to hear the music again. This movie is light years better than any of the garbage that Hollywood is cranking out and might be the best Godzilla entry ever.",
    "38": "As a lifelong fan of Kaiju movies I figured I would enjoy this film, but I didn't expect that it was going to be so AWESOME!!Ok, some SPOILERS AHEAD:Post war Japan was in a very low point but the people are resilient to regain their society and a sense of self as does the young soldier returning emotionally scarred from war and dealing with his trauma of guilt.Many of our characters are severely touched by the effects of war. There are some rousing moments of National military pride but, like the original Gojira, I feel this is more an anti war film and about the human desire to live.There is a deep and emotional human interest story here and I found it engaging and moving, in fact I had tears running down.Of course there are some truly amazing vfx that support the story without taking away from what's really going on, but I felt the real strength was in the music and the performances.There's a really good film here, definitely among the best of the year so far.",
    "39": "This is one of the best Godzilla movies. Shows very well the Japanese Internal conflict of the war: the shame, lost of hope, the change for the best and the human triumph.The symbols are very well represented: the titanic forces of destruction that can be overcome when the human spirit gets awakened from the dark of insecurity, weakness and suffering, or in other words what don't kill make stronger.Beautiful directed, wonderful music, emotion and also, what can I say, my beloved monster on the scene: fearsome and powerful like no other movies.Hope to see a continuation of this saga with more monsters and more drama.",

This information left me thinking how American movies are made with astronomical budgets just to give us mediocre movies.I saw many themes about life, but what I liked the most was \"hope\" and \"love of life\" which was something well executed in a Godzilla movie that usually wasn't focused on characters suffering and there psychological struggles.Finally, I recommend everyone to watch it to experience something different than usual.",
    "51": "I'm a huge fan of Godzilla and this is a amazing movie in the franchise. I really like the new reboot of the movie with Godzilla new origins and his designs looks amazing. The story is done really well with the main character in guilt over what he done in the opening of the movie and determines to stop Godzilla. It really shows how much someone wants to take down something that haunted them for years. The destruction scenes are done really well on how horrifying it is when Godzilla cause so much damage to the city and how dangers to be in the same place as that giant monster. The characters are done really well with their development and supportive to each others throughout the movie. Also, the movie contains a lot of great effects to be found in this movie and looks so real. And the movie gets both suspenseful and intense in the scenes with Godzilla and shows how much panic to be in the same situations as the characters. Overall, its an amazing movie in the franchise.",
    "52": "The directing, the editing, the writing, the acting and the music are all AMAZING! I have never been more involved and invested in a monster/action movie before! I dare to say, this incredible film is more of a family drama reminding us of the importance of life and the choice to live are life's to the fullest! I am simply blown away by the adventure and drama. I found myself tearing up at several spots during the movie. Hollywood needs these types of movies! The human experience is shared and felt through the powerful acting performances! I definitely want to watch Godzilla Minus One again and again. I have no complaints. My second favorite movie of the year behind Oppenheimer!",
    "53": "I won't make a super long review here because I think I can sum this up in a few sentences. Godzilla Minus One is the best Godzilla to date, it holds its own against Hollywood's version visually, its got the best story with touching moments and wonderful actors, the best version of Godzilla and gives you a very satisfying ending IMO. Go see this immediately and support Goji in Japan and in America, I believe both are amazing and I can't wait to see what the sequel might be. Godzilla Minus One is second to no one. 9/10 final score and the best movie I've seen all year!I have to meet the character limit, sorry 😅",
    "54": "I just want to say that holywood need to see this masterpiece and relise how movies need to be made, this is THE best Godzilla movie so far, story, special effects, cinematography, everything is superb, acting,\ncharacters, this is movie about agressive devaststing godzila, you feel the power and real threat when he is in the scene, i did not felt boring during whole movie, this is really one of the best thrilling and engaging stories with complex characters in Godzilla film yet, i cannot recomend this movie enough, and all of that on 15 million budget, hello The Marvels enyone. Thank god for this movie, because after trash like The Marvels, Napoleon, Silent night...etc, this is superb movie and must watch.",
    "55": "Perhaps I went in with too grand of expectations given how my small bubble of critics I respect were praising this film. It did not impress me nearly as much as it did some others, but is still an enjoyable watch. The story of our protagonist is excellent and stands in stark contrast to how human characters are handeled in the American adaptations. The pacing is great with some lagging in act 2. The main reason this film is worth seeing is because it shines such a damning light on the neglegence, greed, and waste that must occur in these big hollywood blockbusters that have 20-30x the budget without producing nearly enough to show it.",
    "56": "After so many Japanese attempts to making a good Godzilla film, not only did they make a good one. They made the best one. With a real story with characters that have substance, along with the meanest Godzilla ever to hit the big screen, this movie hit a grand slam. The story was really good and Godzilla? He was no longer the Japanese man in the rubber suit stomping model cars. You don't find yourself rooting for the dinosaur in this one. He's just a big, nasty monster and he's frightening. You almost wish the movie could have been longer because it was that good. You got to like the main characters. I hope there is a sequel. This one deserves it.",
    "57": "Subtitled Japanese version of Godzilla doesn't fail to please. This movie is for the fans of the original movies who don't mind sketchy effects and predictable dialogue. It follows the story of a young kamikaze pilot who survives the end of WWll by going awol to avoid death. He struggles throughout the movie with his guilt while encountering Godzilla various times. The movie moves at a pace similar to the original Raymond Burr starring film. It would have been interesting to have seen this movie in black and white. At times the movie drags but later on it picks up and has plenty of action to its predictable ending. All in all, if you are a fan of the old school Godzilla, you'll like this offering.",
    "58": "This movie reminds me of the joker with Joaquin Phoenix! It's so naturally believable without all the CGI. Great storyline that fits natural human behavior. No BS! Go check it out for sure. Overall you will enjoy such a naturally written script that you don't mind reading the subtitles and man do I hate reading subtitles but took a chance and boy did I make a right decision.If you're into the whole CGI and exaggeration of a funny and action movie then this is not it for you. But if you enjoy a movie that's exceptional deliverable then this is it. Take a friend, family, heck, or even yourself like I did. You won't regret it!",
    "59": "Some monsters are within ourselves. This film full of soulful story shows battles within the human spirit as well as a cataclysmic giant monster. Acting is spot on, with riveting emotion, and heartfelt joys as well as sorrows. Directing was incredible, I got a full sense of height and size unseen in any previous movie in recent memory.\"The Good Stuff\" that made Godzilla a hit before is all here: wild effects, teamwork, problem-solving, a rousing musical score, and absurdities of daily life with a touch of humour. All boxes are checked for me. A number of twists did indeed surprise me, all with excellent outcomes. This is an advanced direction for Godzilla, I'm excited to see which direction Toho Studios takes us from here.",
    "60": "I've been watching Godzilla cartoons and movies since I was a kid and my son asked to go see this one. I had not heard of it, but of course I went. This is a heavy film. There's a legit plot and I'd guess Godzilla is a metaphor for the \"war after the war\" for a lot of soldiers. It took me a minute to get into the movie because it's so different than any Godzilla movie before it. Great acting, great story, and of course some great scenes of destruction from the world's favorite radioactive reptile. It's in Japanese so you have to pay a little closer attention to the subtitles if you don't speak, but that did not deter from the movie at all. I love it when I am pleasantly surprised by a movie.",
    "61": "My family left the theater in awe. And I think Godzilla's atomic bomb breath blew all the speakers out of the theater. What an amazing achievement this director and the actors have done by creating this Post world war II movie. We were awe struck by the set pieces in this film. The character development is phenomenal and seeing everybody in the theater crying during a Godzilla movie was incredible. Who ever thought that in a Godzilla movie they would be sweetness and subtleness... A movie about shame, redemption, courage, sacrifice, emotional distress, and camaraderie all wrapped in one. A pure masterpiece.",
    "62": "Ifi could I would give this movie a 20.This was by far one of the best Godzilla movies I have seen in a long time.Timelines were perfect. Language captions was a perfect thing to do. Originally in the original language with caption subtitles.The human stars of this movie were believable and won my appreciation for how they played their parts. Even Akikio the baby, was adorable and acted her little but off.Now the star of the show. Man. I liked this Godzilla. He started out huge, and mean. But what he turns into after being feed all of the war explosions, man, was spectacular. When he first appeared after growing up, the whole theater was cheering and clapping. And when he first used his atomic breath. Oh man the cheers, claps and noise from the theater was epic.GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!THE ENDING WAS THE BEST. I will not give it away here.See it for yourself this Christmas. You won't be disappointed. I guarantee it.",
    "63": "I'm hesitant about monster movies, or any blockbuster \"spectacle\" type movie. They do have a stereotype for being mindless for a reason. But this one avoided the pitfalls of the genre. They wisely went with a metaphorical route for Godzilla, and the story's runtime was anchored not in action, but in human drama that felt authentic.That being said, it was a little slower than I anticipated. And I was not a fan of the \"set up a sequel\" ending in the final couple minutes. But all in all, it was well written, well acted, and creatively directed. And there are a few well-placed comedic moments as well. It's another data point in my head, filed under the name \"why can't more blockbusters be like this\"",
    "64": "I'm a huge fan of Godzilla, I think the original from 1954 is a genuine classic and a great film (not just a great \"monster\" movie). The Heisei era is my overall favorite, and I thought Shin Godzilla was weird in all the right ways. It was one of my favorite movies from that year.This one might be even better. You actually care about the characters. It deals with some very serious topics, such as survivors guilt and the aftermath of war violence on civilians and conflicting emotions around national pride and feeling betrayed by your government. Yet the film is also exciting and optimistic and has some of the best Godzilla sequences ever put to screen. My favorite depiction of Godzilla is as a force of nature, representing the power of the atomic bomb or the fury of war itself. That's the Godzilla you get here. I think this film can very favorably be compared to American classics like Jaws and Jurassic Park, too.I don't want to say too much, it's best to just experience the movie for yourself. The only part that felt a little false to me was the very end, but I understand why the director wanted to do it that way. The special effects look great for the most part, but there are a couple of shots here and there that aren't perfect when compared to some Hollywood movies. However, it hardly matters. This is an incredible film.9/10 easily, probably closer to 9.5My current Godzilla rankings:1) Gojira (1954)\n2) Godzilla Minus One (2023)\n3) Godzilla vs. Destoroyah (1995)\n4) Shin Godzilla (2016)\n5) Return of Godzilla (1984)Special mentions to GMK, Godzilla vs. Biollante, Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla (1974) and Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964)",
    "65": "This is an exciting film. The pace, story, imagination, production are all done expertly. Dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles. I wish I could comment on writing but just be assured that despite my remedial Japanese (and a range of inconsequential translation departures the I detected), the cast's ability to convey agony, loss, hope, love, fear, and anger was appreciated, even with its 'just-right' dose of melodrama. Special effects are superior and well presented.The film sucks you into a vortex of history, monsters, and surprisingly restores your faith in humanity. It makes you fall in love with the characters.Then with perfect timing, reflects the singular and exquisite quality of the Japanese people; their acute sense of the cost of war and their abiding commitment to the future.Because of that, there is nothing in this film that I can criticize.",
    "66": "I just saw the advanced screening of Godzilla minus one and I have to say I was very pleased with the final product. If I had any complaints about this movie it is just that the CGI Godzilla often looked weird similar to a video game. However when Godzilla looked good, it was very impressive especially in the water scenes.Unlike every other Godzilla movie I have ever seen this is the first Godzilla movie where I actually liked on the characters and the storyline actually made sense and touched the human heart. It showed what people were dealing with at that time which was directly after world war II and how people were suffering not only with the after effects of the war but also the trauma from being exposed to a huge monster destroying cities.Godzilla may be a fictional character but loss and tragedy are real, and people are dealing with it everyday.Overall I really like this movie and it is obviously a prequel to the original Godzilla movie that came out over 70 years ago. Once you see this movie at some point you will understand why.What I would really like to see since it is clear that there have been multiple Godzilla's at some point in time is some type of legitimate crossover between toho and the American studios who are producing Godzilla monster verse in America. Last thing I or any fans want to see is a competition on who could spit out different and unique Godzilla's in two different countries.Since this is a Toho and Japanese produced movie, it would have been nice to have some of the theater edition Godzilla toys for sale like they do in Japan on every release.",
    "67": "I could see the obvious progress of quality from \"Shin-Godzilla\" and other Legendary's Godzilla series. It's no doubt thanks to all new creators' mindset to try to outperform the previous works, based on and standing at the established brand \"Godzilla\". All the successors can benchmark the prior ones and analyze their successful points and failures. Yamazaki learned a lot from Anno's work and made some improvements and corrections particularly on the point that it couldn't catch on overseas. One of them is the music. He succeeded in taking on Naoki Sato, who is the graduate of Tokyo university of the arts, paying respect to the alumni and predecessor Ifukube and understanding his music deeply. In this film, vision and music are fantastically synchronized. And of course, the main character is Godzilla, but Yamazaki has done well in letting him act simply as a fearful object. Therefore, we can empathize fully with characters competing with Godzilla. Yamazaki who has suffered a streak of bummers in making films looks to be recovering his confidence, and is expected to deliver another sequel of Godzilla film, in which we can see a \"real\" duel with monsters like Ghidra or Mothra.",
    "68": "\"This Movie, Painted In Despair, Will Strike You With Fear\" - Director Takashi YamasakiOH MY GODZILLA!!!!I'm utterly speechless, this movie was amazing in every possible way imaginable for an audience wanting to be entertained. The Human characters were very well written, the acting was outstanding, the emotions were strong with loss, pride and hope. The main cast were perfect together as a group, even the minor characters were amazing. The music, Oh My God the Music was conducted to fit every scene it was in and the OG theme was incredible to hear in a Dolby theater for the first time. Akira Ifukube would be proud, May he Rest In Peace. Lastly it was very educating in a way to see what Japan was like immediately after the War following the Atomic Bombs. The hardships they went through just to rebuild was very emotional to watch, but the way they climbed out of that pit of hopelessness would inspire any viewer to the franchise both Long Time along with Newer FansNow to the matter at Hand, the Star Himself, GODZILLA.The King of the Monsters is more terrifying in this movie than any other in the 69 year history of the Longest running franchise in the World! Every time he appears on screen he strikes fear into your very soul and leaves you in Awe at the same time. His destruction was unrelenting, the action out of this world, his Power Godly, his portrayal Very Real. At times you almost feel sorry for him because what's happened to him wasn't his fault. I haven't seen a monster movie this well done since Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) and Cloverfield (2008).My solid review of this movie is a 10/10, and I recommend save notifications of any kind for when this movie hits the Home Media market because I sure will.Honestly I don't think I've ever watched a movie this perfect beforeLast note, The Whole Theater shook everytime Godzilla took a Step and my very bones were vibrating from his Roar\n#godzilla #godzilla1954 #godzillaminusone #monster #japan.",
    "69": "This film was very well done an excellent story that was touching exciting and scary. Godzilla was angry menacing and unpredictable. But the real heart of the film was a story of post war Japan and what the survivors had to endure. The stories of the survivors is inner woven with Godziilas arrival. And how they have deal with this new terror. There is a seen in this film where Godzilla is chasing a small boat that you will not soon forget it is terrifing.Other than the 1st Godziila film this is the best Godziila film but it is more than a Godziila film . It is a great overall film with emotion compassion and yet very scary.The visualized Godzilla is very well done with many close up shots were you can appreciate his anger and intelligence. A very well done story line and solid acting. I saw this film in an IMAX which was quite an experience. After the film they were handing out IMAX Godzilla posters . And basically every one took a poster . The movie lobby was filled with people staying to discussing the film they had just seen. I also liked their use of the original sound track brought back many memories. See this movie in the biggest screen you can find you will not regret it. All those involved with the production of this film deserved credit. Thank you.",
    "70": "The story is set amidst the physical and emotional wreckage of Japan at the end of WW2 and just after. This realism is blended very well with a fictitious monster. For Japan, the war was not over.The unforgettable production utilizes some of the original Godzilla music. It is in Japanese with English subtitles.The story is pro-human. Seeing how people cared for each other in the midst of disaster is what moved me to tears. No snarky or edgy dialog or lame jokes that ruin so many Hollywood scripts in my opinion. Come to think of it, I can't remember a single humorous moment in the movie, though there were moments of joy and comraderie.It is a story about grass roots self-reliance and cooperation. Although some military men assist them, the Japanese realize that their government won't save them. Scientists and former military men come together, borrow some military equipment form a plan to defeat Godzilla.It is also a story about cowardice, the crippling shame that comes with it, and how cowardice can actually buy time for one to build one's courage. Remember what they say about backing away from a fight and staying alive so you can live to fight another day.I am not going to spoil it for you. Go see it.",
    "71": "Watched for the first time on December 2nd 2023\nFormat: IMAX\nMy rating is 8.5/10Synopsis: Post war Japan is at its lowest point when a new crisis emerges in the form of a giant monster, baptized in the horrific power of the atomic bomb. (Source: IMDb)When was the last time that we witnessed a 'monster film' that didn't have a cheap script with a target of just making lots of money?Minus one proves that it's not entirely a film about a monster, rather it's a film about humanity, Inner self, grief, and family. The film was able to create a story about Godzilla but from a different perspective by combining both drama and action together. Brining a character that struggles with himself, his past, his grief, and his PTSD. As well as adding side characters that will bring a more dramatic experience to his life and to audience members.Moreover, the film really surprised me by using Japan's tragedy after the WWII, and building the film's plot around it. Bringing room to some great political topics that connects and affects the film's story and events.The film unfortunately lacks during a few scenes with bad CGI that looks bad and cheap and results in an ugly still frame. Moreover, I low-key found Godzilla's look to be...childish. It doesn't seem like he is a 'monster', rather a kids action figure.Overall, an experience that must be watched on the biggest screen possible, especially that GREAT 'MONSTER FILMS' WITH A GOAL TO PLEASE THE AUDIENCE are very very RARE.",
    "72": "I'm a huge godzilla toho fan and i own all 30+ godzilla versions made by toho from the original 1954 film to the latest 2016 shin godzilla film but while shin was a disappointment as it was boring and more of a bla bla this new 2023 version is a serious godzilla movie with great atmosphere plot and scenes the most serious godzilla film since the 1964 film godzilla vs mothra.Most of the toho G films are for little kids as they are campy and silly with the 1973 film godzilla vs megalon to hit the bottom of the barel but this new take on godzilla is for adults and take the monster seriously.I will not spoil the film so u have to go see it and believe me u will lone 4 more.The only thing that i can find as a negative is that we don't see in this film other kaiju monsters like ghidora and mothra with rodan to name a few but i hope we get to see them in real fights in the hopefully announced soon sequel.Also the film was kind of slow pace in first half an hour and at that time the monster had little screening time but after first 30 minutes this was fixed.If u are a die hard godzilla fan pre-order the dvd/blu ray and go quickly to see this film in a theater near you.It's what u were waiting for.Finally after three average and boring films (tokyo sos, final wars, shin) toho finally delivers a great godzilla flick.Grade // A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++",
    "73": "\"Hello, boys! I'm Back!\" was the Independence Day movie quote I thought about during this movie and it really fit for more ways than Minus One.It would be hard to rank this amongst other Godzilla movies considering I've probably only seen one-fourth of the Thirty-Eight (38!!) films, but I can safely say this would be in the top three. Maybe top two? I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE. Possibly only the first one from 1954 could top it as it was original, deep and far ahead of its time.Weird...there's this recent trend of making Reboot/Remake/Sequel/Prequels of classics - all rolled into one. Only some kinda work. This MORE than works. Its setting was perfect and I truly can't believe this never occurred to them before. This was kinda like the Rogue (Minus) One of Godzilla flicks.Immediately at the end of WWII and through the recovery process, Japan is hit once again, but this time by a VICIOUS, ANGRY God...zilla. They hadn't even begun to put the pieces of their lives back together and the big guy isn't going to let them off the hook for WWII. In fact, you actually feel very sorry for our old enemy (at the time) because of the giant green's wrath halting their healing.But, that's just the Godzilla portion of the movie. The REAL plot has incredible heart. I even teared up several times.The real story is of a \"coward\" who dodged Kamikazeing himself at the end of WWII and the repercussions of that. While he's trying to heal/cope, in comes both the title character and a new family to help care for. You follow him, his new friends and partner of sorts with a baby girl while he's dealing with both PTSD and the big baddie who's really into destruction.I know a ton of Godzilla/Kaiju films focus on the humans more than the monsters for various reasons: cheaper to shoot humans than large battles/annihilation scenes, probably can only show a giant monster stomping around for so long and we're supposed to root for the central characters, for examples. But, of ALL the Godzilla movies, including the Monsterverse (2014's Godzilla, 2019's Godzilla: King of the Monsters and 2021's Godzilla vs. Kong) that I really love a lot, not a single Godzilla movie made me care this much about the characters. I really felt something for the main characters A TON.Overall, I really loved the settings, cinematography, CGI, ALL of the characters here, the depth and scope of the stakes at hand, the POV of the Japanese after WWII and what their country did to their own citizens and how they improved the Godzilla look. He looked FANTASTIC. Plus, the new way they handled his atomic breath...absolutely amazing.I cannot recommend this movie enough. I truly hope this opens the door to much more mature, thought-out and well-made Godzilla films made by all-around great talents.***Final Thoughts: While it wasn't the very last one, I'm SUPER GLAD this was 1000x better than the last Japanese-made Godzilla film I saw: 2016's Shin Godzilla. I took a chance with Minus One after being INCREDIBLY let down by Shin Godzilla. That was a two-hour movie where Godzilla clocked in for about 5-minutes of screentime MOST of which was him evolving from a Laugh-Out-Loud, bugged-eyed CGI-abomination. The rest of the movie were board members in a boring room trying to decide what to do about the creature. Minus One was the POLAR opposite of Shin, thank God...zilla.",
    "74": "Set in post World War II Japan, Kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) returns to the ruins of Tokyo racked with survivor's guilt over running from his duty as a kamikaze and being the survivor of an attack by a creature known only as Godzilla. With Koichi's parents both dead, he soon finds renewed purpose when he meets fellow survivor Noriko (Minami Hamabe) who is caring for orphaned infant Akkiko (Sae Nagatani). As the three build an unconventional family over the next two years with Koichi finding work as a minesweeper ridding the waters of leftover U. S. and Japanese sea mines, Godzilla returns to wreak havoc upon Japan carrying with it deadly nuclear power.Godzilla Minus One is the latest Japanese produced Godzilla film from Toho following their last effort from 2016 with Shin Godzilla. Due to the nature of the deal with Legendary Picture's own Monsterverse, Toho had to abstain from producing their own Godzilla productions (save for some anime projects) and the company's return to the Godzilla franchise was further put off by other factors such as Covid. Takashi Yamazaki incorporated the feelings of anxiety felt in recent years into his approach for the film and decided to set the film in the immediate aftermath of Japan's defeat in World War II to add to the feeling of bleakness in his approach for Godzilla as an embodiment of fear. Now graced with a wide U. S. release that hasn't been seen for a Japanese Godzilla film since Godzilla 2000, I'm pleased to say Godzilla Minus One might well be not just a contender for the best Godzilla film, but also one of the year's best films.What really stands out with Godzilla Minus One is the film's amazingly fleshed out characters and environment. With very rare exceptions many Godzilla movies often feel like the human characters are there more out of obligation than any other reason and with the exception of maybe Dr. Serizawa from the original 1954 film (and maybe Raymond Burr's Steven Martin from the U. S. re-edit) many would be hard pressed to tell you anything all that memorable about the human characters. With Godzilla Minus One Takashi Yamazaki's characters were so good and so fleshed out that I became invested to the point I often forgot this was a Godzilla movie. The characters of Koichi, Noriko, and Akiko make for an engaging family who we really grow to care about especially since they're three broken people who've inadvertently come together almost without realizing it to form themselves into a whole. Ryunosuke Kamiki gives a great performance as Koichi and his heartbreakingly raw performance of a man struggling with PTSD and survivor's guilt is beautifully realized and gives a solid arc that pays off in a satisfying way. The movie also features a great supporting cast including Koichi's shipmates who are all memorable and engaging in their own right often adding a level of humor and humanity that keeps the film from becoming overwrought.But just because the movie features a lot of character and emotion it doesn't forget it's also a kaiju movie and Yamazaki certainly delivers on that front giving us the most gritty, intense, and often times scary version of this material one can recall of recent memory. Yamazaki films Godzilla Minus One very much like a war movie with the action rarely leaving the level of the human characters which helps to drive home how imposing and powerful of a force Godzilla is in the movie. In many ways the filmmaking reminded me of recent benchmarks in the war genre such as 1917 and Dunkirk in how tense and thrilling the action scenes are. Godzilla himself just looks fantastic and is absolutely terrifying in some scenes with a great introductory scene dwarfed by a later scene where he chases a wooden minesweeper. The fact the movie's only made for $15-20 million (estimated) and looks better than some films that cost 10 times that much only makes it all the more impressive.Godzilla Minus One was a real pleasant surprise. Being a lifelong Godzilla fan I expected to like Godzilla Minus One, but I never expected to be as impressed as I was with the characters and story as I was with the technical aspects. I'm not joking when I say I feel this movie could be a contender for Best Foreign Language Film at next year's Academy Awards.",
    "75": "Godzilla Minus One, a new Godzilla film by Japanese production company Toho, has been given a high Rotten Tomatoes score of 97%, making it the second-highest rated Godzilla film of all time. The film, set in post-WW2 Japan, follows the Kaiju monster, fueled by the atomic bomb, as it causes a crisis and wreaks havoc on the country. The film is a Japanese rendition of the classic Godzilla story, existing outside the Americanized Monsterverse, which includes Godzilla, King Kong, and other monsters. The score positions it well above recent Monsterverse films like Godzilla vs. Kong (76% Tomatometer), 2019's Godzilla: King of the Monsters (42%), and 2017's Kong: Skull Island (75%). Godzilla Minus One is set to release on December 1. Godzilla Minus One is a darker, more brutal take on the monster, set in Japan after World War II and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The film features a brutal force decimating skyscrapers with only a step of its foot. Unlike modern Toho-produced Godzilla films, which have a 86% Tomatometer, Godzilla Minus One has a remarkable human element, as the human characters show resilience after being destroyed by war, bombings, and the monster itself. Critics call it one of the best Kaiju monster films of all time. Godzilla Minus One is a spectacular kaiju film that explores the soul of postwar Japan. The film, directed by writer/director Yamazaki, is better known for family-friendly releases like his two Doraemon movies. Yamazaki has dealt with historical drama before, such as The Eternal Zero and The Great War of Archimedes. In Godzilla Minus One, the questioning aspect of his earlier dramas is front and center. The film features a human-like character, Koichi (Kamiki), a kamikaze pilot who fled rather than suffer honorable death in flames. Koichi's neighbors, Sumiko (Ando), and Noriko (Hamabe), are surrounded by grief, ghosts, and guilt. Koichi builds a proxy family with Sumiko, Noriko, and Akiko, while working to clear tens of thousands of mines left in Japan by both the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Allies. The film provides an enthralling historical drama about Japan's postwar reconstruction, and Yamazaki embraces the story and characters with tenderness and thoughtfulness. The monstrous carnage doesn't crush the human drama, but only adds to it. The film's kaiju period piece is a testament to Yamazaki's ability to create a captivating and thought-provoking film. Minus One is a film that embodies the hallmarks of Spielberg's work, with its romantic, rosy period aesthetic, sadness, and sweeping sense of what used to be. The action sequences are built on tension and choreography, with Godzilla being a prominent character. The film takes lessons from Jaws and uses more effective scope, with a scene where Godzilla chases survivors on an animatronic tugboat. Yamazaki acknowledges the influence of Spielberg and Jaws, as well as his favorite 2001 film, Godzilla. While Jaws imbued Godzilla with Pacific soldiers' souls to punish Japan for wartime crimes, Minus One uses the subtext of PTSD and survivor's guilt to haunt the protagonist's dreams. He believes Godzilla is the physical manifestation of the souls he failed to save, creating an allegory for the protagonist's dereliction of duty.",

Pure perfection from start to finish, I just can't believe how good this film was. I got tears by the end of the film.Absolutely outstanding.I do not want to spoil anything but I have to fill the character requirements here. The cinematography is the BEST of any monster film. It's on par with great War films like Dunkirk. The writing, acting, music is just phenomenal. Everything just works in harmony. Godzilla is terrifying, a real menace to humanity. The atomic breath is literally an atomic blast as it should be.A must watch.",
    "77": "Almost 70 years after the first GODZILLA film by Ishiro HONDA, the Japanese film studio TOHO has dared to reorient the globally successful Kaiju film franchise. And this venture has succeeded spectacularly. But one after anonther!On October 27, 1954, the very first GODZILLA film (the monster's actual name is Gojima in Japanese) premiered in Tokyo. One of the main actors was the actor Akira TAKARADA (1934-2022), who died just a year ago. The aftermath of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the devastating defeat in the Second World War and the psychological devastation of Japanese society were congenially woven into a monster story that could be understood worldwide and led to a long-lasting film success with countless follow-up films.GODZILLA MINUS ONE follows on from this, with director Takashi YAMAZAKI (born 1964) telling the history and origins of GOJIMA.The focus is on the deserting kamikaze pilot Koichi (Ryunosuke KAMIKI), who encounters the monster for the first time in the very last days of the war. Back in Tokyo, Koichi is confronted with the destruction of Japan and the distress of the survivors. He soon finds a companion (Minami HAMABE) and joins a ship that takes care of removing the explosive weapons. The still badly shaken Koichi and the ship's crew soon meet Gojima again. When the monster sets course for Tokyo, events come to a head...This film has become an outstanding monster film that impresses with spectacular scenes that you should definitely see on the big screen. At the same time, it is also an illuminating depiction of the disillusioned post-war society in Japan.The Japanese film studio TOHO has achieved a great success here, which will almost certainly be a worldwide success. A sequel is sure to follow, which is something to look forward to now!",

Takashi Yamazaki wrote and directed a film true to form. Something that resembled a modernized version of its predecessors.I get it. You have the most recent reboot that came with spinoffs. Theirs the AppleTV+ series and a sequel to the \"Godzilla Vs Kong\" film that comes out in April of next year. It's a lot and this is separate from all of those.There were so many kids in the theater. Which made for an unenjoyable experience. I guess the parents didn't know. All these kids under the age of ten watching a Japanese film with subtitles. I'm shocked more kids weren't checked out. I mean I probably would've enjoyed it at that age though. But that's because I've always loved going to the cinema and watching films with my mom. I'm a film junky what can you say, blame my mom for that one. The parents enjoyed it at least, like my mom probably would've.This film brought the franchise to its roots. I loved it. Certain parts I could make some complaints about but realistically it's nothing worth writing.If you're a fan of the older Japanese staple \"Godzilla\" films or just into destruction with an actual plot check this out. I give it five mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin\n#CosmoMovieBlog\n#CosmoLanier\n#GodzillaMinusOne.",
    "79": "I've been going to the movies to see Godzilla films since I was a kid growing up in the 70s. I'm a huge fan of the Original 1954 film, Godzilla vs The Thing 1964, Destroy all Monsters 1968, Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla 1993, GMK 2001, Final Wars 2004, Shin Godzilla 2016 and Godzilla vs Kong 2021. I've been following the big G forever. I collect the Bandai figures, the Ifukube scores and I attend the G-Fest Conventions.With all that said, I just went to see Godzilla Minus One at an IMAX showing on opening day. Without giving spoilers, I'll just say that this film is what the original 1954 film attempted to be but was hampered by the limitations of 1950s technology affordable to Japan in that era. The nuclear themes are here in force. The human story is moving, well acted and engaging. Godzilla has surpassed all previous versions of malevolence. This is probably the first time since the original where you see people getting messed up. GMK had its moments but this film relishes in it. It's in my opinion, the perfect Godzilla movie. And the military battles were epic.",
    "80": "'Godzilla Minus One' is a story about survival, struggle, relationships, trauma, PTSD, the effects of war, shame, guilt and redemption. Never have I seen a movie about Godzilla that was so much not about Godzilla.While the special effects were worthwhile with some frightening sequences from the monster himself, I left the theater in tears with so much on my mind about this story, the people, the monster that is war itself and the personal wars we still live through after the fight is over.The actors themselves give the type of performance I haven't seen in a long time in monster movies. Typically, this tends to be an issue with those types of movies where the human characters actually get in the way of the story developing either by regressing it or deviating from it. I'm glad it stayed on course for this film.Bravo, Toho. Bravo!",
    "81": "The King of Monsters has returned in the greatest G-Movie since Shin Godzilla.Yet, I feel a little bad about it. Minus One is without a doubt a period piece set in the Aftermath of World War Two about a Hero's journey of a man who gets over death and war stress by finding friends and family that give him a reason to live. It's the type of movie that goes around the award circuits like the Golden Globes or the Oscars, if not for the fact that this movie is wrapped firmly in a big Godzilla SandwichAnd what a bite! It's been a minute since I saw Godzilla play the true menace. Classic in design with an upgraded layer of modern technology he showed us who the true antagonist is in Minus One. I was scared frightened, horrified, and disturbed, just the overall package.Brilliant!",
    "82": "I will admit upfront that Godzilla films have not been something I ever raved about or was eager for. The American films are good for what they are (for the most part) and the original from Japan in 1954 is a very solid film for its time. Well, after 70 years and about 40 films in total (most of which are not connected at all), we have arrived at Godzilla Minus One. Again, I will preface this review by stating I haven't seen the majority of them. With that said though, of the films I have seen, this is easily my favourite. Let's dive into why I loved Godzilla Minus One.The film begins at the end of World War II, when a glimpse of Godzilla is had by a few people. Only a couple of these people survive to tell the tale. The film then flashes forward a few years and catches up with one of those survivors, Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), who becomes the main character. Building a very unlikely family with Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe) and a young child they must take care of, a few years pass by, only to have the re-emergence of this creature. Unlike many of the modern iterations of Godzilla, this version is just angry and wants to terrorize anything in its path. The human drama (which is terrific), mixed with the looming threat that everyone could die in a second from this creature, made for a fantastic, tension-filled experience.I've heard that the budget for this film roughly translates to 15 million U. S. dollars, but I've also heard writer/director Takashi Yamazaki speak on that matter, saying he was given less to make it. Regardless, this film was made on a very small budget, and for the most part, it visually looks like a Hollywood production. Bravo to everyone involved on the technical side of this film because that blew me away. The design of Godzilla felt modern and classic all at the same time. On top of that, the score may have been the most commendable aspect here. Again meshing modern with classic, this is a fresh score composed by Naoki Satô, while also paying a lot of homage to the original Godzilla theme from the 50s. On a technical level and an emotional character level, this film fires on all cylinders.Godzilla Minus One is a film I had no intention of seeing because I wasn't even sure if it was its own thing or connected to others. I don't keep up with this franchise in that way, but thankfully this film stands entirely on its own. If they were to ever revisit this story and bring these characters back, I would gladly watch another one. I loved every bit of this film. Do I think the Godzilla brand has been overdone? Yes, I do, and even though a lot of the action in this film has been done before in other Blockbusters, I don't have too much to complain about here. Do I think it's perfect? No, but for what it sets out to accomplish, I'm not sure a better film could've been made, and for that, I'm giving this film a full five out of five. See it now in theatres.",
    "83": "I'm writing this review for those people that are hesitant to see a foreign language film with subtitles. This is a great movie. After a while, I didn't even notice that I was reading subtitles.The story gripping and interesting. The action is exciting, and it's not pouring down rain every time that Godzilla appears, like in the CGI flicks. This could be the best Godzilla film ever.I recommend seeing it on the big screen. Godzilla is big and loud and Minus One should be watched big and loud.I rarely take the time to write reviews, but I felt that this film deserves it. I'm afraid that many will miss out on this great movie because of the subtitles.Don't let that stop you. Go see it.",
    "84": "Imagine a Roland Emmerich disaster flick (only good XD), with a script that's had some actual care put into it, and you'll be halfway to understanding what a huge achievement has been realized here. All for a meager $15 million budget no less! Godzilla Minus One is far and away the best Gojira film I've seen, bar none, and sets an impressive new standard for the Kaiju/Disaster sub-genres (while in many ways transcending them).The monster-verse producers certainly have their work cut out for them if they hope to remain even remotely competitive going forward (not that I can really see that happening). Indeed, if I learned one thing from G-1 it's that Godzilla is inherently, and should always remain, a purely Japanese tale at its core. With the roots/themes so intrinsically tied to that country's history and cultural sentiments, the artists there clearly know better than anyone how to capture the essence of the idea, as well as explore its various metaphorical undertones in both compelling and poignant ways. All in all, this makes for one hell of a monster movie that genuinely has something to say.Judging by the financial success of the film so far, I'd be shocked if a followup wasn't green-lit before the year is out, and I am genuinely excited to see what further surprises the creators have in store for us. In the meantime, I'll be sure to check out more of the classic Japanese entries now that my Gojira fandom has been rekindled (for the first time since I was 12).\"The mass extinction we feared has already begun!\"Rating: 8/10.",
    "85": "Much better than I expected. A terrific film on every level. I'm so glad I went to a real theater to see it. 100% NON-Woke. I've seen most of the Godzilla movies. Let's ignore the silly ones made in the 1970s. Each Godzilla movie takes a different approach at telling the story. For example, Godzilla 2014 dealt with the inefficiencies of government bureaucracies in dealing with the Godzilla threat. Godzilla 2000, (one of my favorites) centers around a small, and independent research team.In Godzilla Minus One, we see an accurate portrayal of the difficult life in Japan just after the end of World War II, and how the appearance of Godzilla personally affects individuals. There's plenty of Godzilla squishing things, and being a major nuisance but what I enjoyed was the excellent acting on how a creature like that affects people individually and personally. Each Godzilla movie attempts to improve upon Godzilla's atomic breath. Godzilla Minus One does not disappoint.I would prefer to watch the movie dubbed in English. I think it makes it just a little easier. The subtitles were well done and not overwhelming. In fact, only about 25% has any subtitles to read it all. Typically, Toho will release the movie in Japanese with English subtitles and then when they release the movie on Blu-ray, they will provide an English dubbed version at that point. When available, I normally see both the Japanese and English versions of the better Godzilla movies. Even the hard to get (it's out there) Godzilla 1985 with brief appearances by Raymond Burr.One minor disappointment is I missed the first 10 minutes of the film. Generally the wife and I arrive at a theater 10 minutes \"late\" so we can skip most of the trailers. I forgot this is a Japanese film, and they insist upon it starting precisely at the advertised time. I will go again in a few days and make sure I get there when I should. Whether you're a Godzilla fan or not, you WILL like this movie.",
    "86": "WOW, Godzilla/Gojira has truly reached Stratospheric Cinematic heights (both aesthetically and creatively) in this spectacular new film 'Godzilla Minus One' proving that original Japanese Studio TOHO best understands how to immerse a 'Gojira' film in deep historical relevance & profound insight, injecting a full-measure of 'gravitas' to the process!In this new film, Godzilla once again embodies the terrifying manifestation of unrelenting nuclear-charged havoc & destruction.... eerily reminiscent of Real World historical events that actually enshrouded Japan at the tail end of WWII.... e.g. Dual Atomic bomb conflagration plus intensive fire bombings that completely levelled Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki (taking many hundreds of thousands of civilian Lives, as a 1945 reality).From a Cinematic standpoint, 'Minus One' creates emotionally-resonant drama by way of extremely gifted actors Ryunosuke Kamiki and Minami Hamabe who are both amazingly adept at transmitting the intense (nearly unbearable) depth of sorrow, regret, and bereavement, feelings that were commonplace among surviving Japanese citizens in aftermath of devastating war..... requiring extraordinary effort & inner-strength to simply survive one single Day to the next. Writer-Director Takashi Yamazaki deserves much credit for the courage to re-visit such a profoundly painful time in Japanese (and World) history.But now on to the one and only King-Kaiju Godzilla! The 'Minus One' Gojira is aesthetically majestic, cinematically spectacular and utterly terrifying, fully-manifested as Vengeful 'Oni' demon-god (replete with fearsome visage similar to the furious masks worn by ancient Samurai warriors entering death-duels thru Eternity).... of course Gojira's 'resonant Roar' never fails to communicate tremendous pain, authentic pathos (plus unadulterated rage) demonstrating an indomitable Will & relentless Spirit.... engendering undeniable feeling that Godzilla is an intelligent ancient Apex behemoth who inhabited the Earth millions of years before the emergence of mankind.... a mighty but forlorn prehistoric creature horribly-mutated and severly-injured by Man's reckless atomic testing endlessly honing weapons of mass-destruction.It is astonishing that a Dai-Kaiju 'giant-monster' fantasy/horror film could also be so serious, thought provoking and profoundly artistic (but of course Ishiro Honda's original 1954 Gojira film did originally establish this amazingly high-standard & superlative precedent).In totality, Takashi Yamazaki's beyond brilliant 'Godzilla Minus One' is a modern masterpiece full of genuine emotional resonance, fantastically thrilling visuals, plus unexpected (but appreciated) dose of significant historical relevance. It is even more astounding that production costs were less than 10% (at around $15 million, a mere fraction) of standard Hollywood Big budget Fantasy/Science fiction films.......making 'Minus One' a small cinematic miracle generating Huge artistry and creative vision + Apex behemoth-sized entertainment value!Note: the showcasing of genius 1954 original Music composer Akira Ifukube's 'Godzilla March' at key points made Gojira's appearances all the more breathtaking & spectacular!",
    "87": "Godzilla Minus One is a reboot/remake of the original Godzilla movie set in post WW2 Japan. Our hero is a disgraced Kamikaze Pilot who survived the war, but will he survive Godzilla? What follows is the best special effects of any Godzilla movie I've ever seen, the best city rampage choreography I've ever seen, and the best Godzilla underwater action I've ever seen.Godzilla is a true destroyer of worlds in this film. A monster who was once a strange Dinosaur type creature that lived near a small island who was mutated by nuclear power and is now angry as hell about it - and out to trash whatever gets in his way.Everything about this new Godzilla movie rules! Where the US Version gets silly and watered down, this is a little silly but mostly gritty reboot. Would love to see an entire series of films based in the Minus One universe.I only give is 9 out of 10 because I'd like see another one that tops this one.",
    "88": "Godzilla Minus One was one of my most anticipated films of the year, and it mostly lived up to the hype for me. It's got an intriguing premise, taking place even earlier than the 1954 original film, with the events of the film playing out in the first couple of years after the end of World War II. The emergence of Godzilla at such a time makes him even more of a danger, given Japan is recovering from the war, and it gives a reason for the then-decimated Japanese military to not be around much to deal with the threat (US forces are also said to be too busy dealing with the new Cold War to help much, which feels about right).There is less action than one might expect from a Godzilla movie, but the big moments do deliver. I loved the opening (surprisingly reminiscent of the campy time-travel-themed Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah from 1991), and then the way each appearance of Godzilla felt bigger, more dramatic, and longer than the last. As for the human side of things, the side characters aren't too complicated, but they are interesting and endearing. The protagonist is given easily the most to reckon with, as he's haunted by guilt from his involvement in the war, and becomes something of a reluctant here with very personal reasons for wanting to take down Godzilla.The plan to deal with the monster is clever, and makes for a good climax. Godzilla himself is also pretty scary in this one - maybe not as visually horrifying as the monster in Shin Godzilla, but that Godzilla was more an oddly tragic and kind of mindless force of nature - more natural disaster than enemy. Minus One's Godzilla is mean, and it makes every appearance he has feel truly weighty.There are elements of the ending I didn't find particularly satisfying - not so much the third act climax, but certain things after that ensured Minus One ended on a tiny bit of a whimper for me. Some might not be crazy about the fact Godzilla disappears for large amounts of time, but the story and the characters involved within it were generally interesting to me; much more so than your average Godzilla movie.As far as Godzilla vs. Humanity movies go (I do have more of a soft spot for Godzilla vs. Other monster entries), Minus One is one of the better ones; up there with the 1954 original and 2016's Shin Godzilla.",
    "89": "I have been watching Godzilla movies for about 50 years. The franchise is 70 years old at this point. In those 70 years, Even with the big budget effects driven films of recent, NOTHING compares to how I felt watching this movie.Godzilla is a metaphor for the world, and life. Having lived through some things, I can identify with the feeling of being utterly powerless. The monstrosity of life, the horrors that it can throw at you, and living despite all the tough things that it throws at you, is all that matters, and that message is driven home by the human elements of this movie. This is not a movie where you sit in the theater and cackle about the effects, the guy in the rubber suit, or the amount of models or styrofoam they used to build all the sets. This is a movie that in the first 5 minutes has your undivided attention. The human story is the setup for the creature scenes, and honestly, I don't think I have ever watched a Godzilla movie, gotten choked up, or been inspired the way this movie made me feel.When I was a kid I loved the old rubber suit films, but this movie really awed me from the standpoint that not only were the effects jaw dropping, but there was a multilayered story that drove home the only salient point that matters. Life is not to be treated cheaply, and unlived.I am absolutely awestruck by this film and the message that it conveyed, because it carries with it a lot of optimism too.Just see the movie. It is better than anything else that has come out this year.",
    "90": "I can't say that I am a huge Godzilla fan but I used to watch these films as a kid and liked the a lot. In the last couple of decades, Hollywood has tried to make Godzilla into huge budgeted blockbusters but with extravagant visual effects but characters that were si bland and boring that the films were pretty forgettable. Godzilla Minus One was made with 10% of the budget of the last 3 or 4 Hollywood versions of Godzilla and is better than any of them.This new film is made by Toho Studios. The Japanese studio that has made most of the Godzilla films. This is not a remake of the 1954 original. Technically it's a prequel. The best thing about this film is that not only does it give what everyone wants in a Godzilla film, great action scenes with awesome Godzilla destruction. It has characters that we as an audience care for. Even though this film is not a remake of the 1854 classic in many ways it uses the monster to comment on how Japan suffered after the atomic bombs were detonated in WW2 and the effect it had on the Japanese people. This film dues a great job at creating characters that we care for. That makes what happens even more compelling. Also This Godzillas look is great. It obviously is based on the look we are used to but this version of the creature is more mebacing than in other films. This isn't the good Godzilla that helps, he is just is definitely the threat and the human characters are bent on defending themselves.The visual effects of this film are on par a times with what has been done in the Hollywood $200 million blockbuster films. The action scenes are fun and even very intense. But they are made even better by a story and characters that we are invested in.Best Godzilla film since the 1954 original!!!Grade: A.",
    "91": "Japanese and Korean movies always surprises me with a beautiful experience , what a movie!!👏👏👏💪💪This is an emotional and dark movie , i really felt this is not fiction story and this is really happening there 😄😄\nWell directing and brilliant story telling with powerful acting as always in Japanese or Korean movies 🎥This is a really good proof that you don't need a big budget for a good blockbuster movieWell done Japanese movies and I really hope Hollywood learn something from these Korean movies. Not only is this the best Godzilla movie ever, it is one of the best movies of the year.Finally the music it's one of the most rousing and nerve-wracking original scores in a recent Godzilla movie.",
    "92": "This should be Japan's Academy Award Contender This is probably the best Godzilla movie I've seen and it even rivals the original 1954 Godzilla as the best movie in the franchise, the story is second to none and the acting is just superb and majority of fans will be pleased to know that this movie mostly takes place in 1947 so it is going back to its WW2, Hiroshima and Nagasaki storyline but that is about all I can say without spoiling anythingPersonally its rivalling as my favourite Godzilla Film of all time, My favourite film of 2023 and my favourite Japanese film of all time and if Japan would submit any movie to win best international film at the Academy Awards next March it would have to be this.I'm sorry but this movie is nothing less then sensational it's sad, it has agonisingly painful moments, it will make you cry and the most important thing that I don't think many Godzilla films have been able to do correctly is that you want the protagonist survive.So ladies and Gentlemen that's it for me highly Recommended and if your thinking watching this film be warned that it is in Japanese with English Subtitles so the ultimate Decision is yours weather you want to see it but if you want to see a good foreign film now make it Godzilla Minus One.",
    "93": "For those who have trouble with subtitles, watching this ad a non-Japanese speaker may be a bit challenging. Between that and the occasional confusing transitions, I could find nothing to dislike about it,The overall film was beautifully crafted as a period piece in the early days following WW2. From the Japanese perspective, this movie was fascinating and could have stood on its own merits simply as a Japanese culture and history movie. Add in Godzilla, as he was originally created to be, and you have perhaps the best Godzilla movie ever made. The sets were fantastic, the acting superb, and Godzilla himself the most terrifying monster ever created. As someone who has not enjoyed most Godzilla movies in the past, this movie captured my heart. What Hollywood misses in the Godzilla saga, this movie mastered. It has that special X factor.Perhaps the best part about the movie in my opinion is that it feels gritty. The filming looked and felt analogue, which made Godzilla himself more believable as the CGI was subdued and perfectly balanced into the set. The soundtrack was both eery when it needs to be and sweet when it needs to be. Pacing was good and everything just worked. The story arc, without spoiling the plot, left the audience feeling satisfied. Definitely worth a watch, and one monster movie I'll enjoy again.Last note, if it's available in your area, see this in 4DX.",
    "94": "Godzilla Minus One blew all my expectations away - what an incredible film! It. Freaking. Rules! It isn't just an amazing Godzilla film, but one of the best films of the year! This truly puts Hollywood's versions of Godzilla to shame. I'm by no means a Godzilla expert, but this was easily the best Godzilla movie I've ever seen! I haven't seen an audience this excited and visibly satisfied by a movie in quite some time! This film showcases how to make the perfect Godzilla picture with a compelling human ensemble and breathtaking action that's savoured from start to finish. Plus, it truly takes Godzilla back to being a truly horrifying monster! (And has the coolest use of the Atomic Breath I've ever seen!)The action is incredible and brutal, and the VFX work is insanely good. I also really loved the cinematography and the killer sound design. Plus, the score is excellent and uses Akira Ifukube's iconic Godzilla theme to great effect.But the reason this film stands out is because of its combination of great storytelling mixed with great technical achievements. There's reason to care about the characters and a deeply emotional side to this film that makes the monster even more haunting. This is a monster film where the human conflict is just as compelling, if not more so, than the tremendous action sequences. I loved the exploration of the traumas of war and cultural destruction in Japan following WWII, and the ways the characters connected to these themes made for such a strong emotional core. This film has the perfect blend of massive monster mayhem and compelling human drama that really worked. It's so good that you could remove Godzilla from the film and still have a great film. This is a moving, thoughtful Japanese character drama set in post-war Japan that also happens to have a giant horrific monster in it. People are gonna talk about Godzilla Minus One's amazing production and filmmaking, but what surprised me the most was the script. Every character has an arc and serves a purpose, and there are no wasted beats. There are so many great dilemmas and dramatic questions. Also a perfect example of using the monster as a greater metaphor. The result is a thrilling epic that feels grounded and meaningful, and so, so good.Godzilla Minus One is a nigh-masterpiece. Not only is Godzilla terrifying again, but the film itself is a powerful drama with some daunting imagery, plenty of emotional moments, sound design to rock the theatre, and a moving character study on post-war guilt and PTSD. It's a genuinely exciting, riveting, emotional disaster flick, delivering drama you care about and thunderous action spectacle. See Minus One on the loudest, biggest screen you can possibly find and enjoy the ride - it's incredible!(I gotta add... it's like Act One is Jurassic Park, Act Two is Jaws, and Act Three is Dunkirk. Just such an awesome movie!)",
    "95": "My wife and I caught Godzilla Minus One (2023) in theaters last night. The plot unfolds as small Japanese islands are devastated by the sea monster Godzilla. A survivor attempts to rebuild his life in different Japanese communities, but Godzilla seems to follow him everywhere. Faced with the constant threat, and some internal guilt, the survivor joins a task force in a final attempt to destroy Godzilla.Directed by Takashi Yamazaki (Returner), the film stars Ryunosuke Kamiki (Studio Ghibli's Spirited Away), Sakura Ando (Monster), Minami Hamabe (Let Me Eat Your Pancreas), and Munetaka Aoki (Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai).This film offers one of the most impressive depictions of Godzilla to date. The attention to detail and CGI are outstanding, making every scene with Godzilla tremendous. The action sequences, destruction, and Godzilla's heat ray are noteworthy. The opening sequence, both at sea and in the city, is absolutely awesome. Surprisingly deep, the storyline features solid subplots and a hero, though annoying, who's worthwhile. The ending scene with the plane is magnificent, and the flash to the title during the conclusion serves as a rewarding reminder of the series' direction.In conclusion, Godzilla Minus One stands as another elite installment into the monster universe from Toho. I would score this 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.",
    "96": "This is a powerful and dramatic retelling of the classic monster film that created an entire genre'. I've heard some people calling it best film of the year. Well, I don't agree with that. But it is definitely a great film and the best Godzilla film since the original. It makes Godzilla a monster again; a majestically horrifying and unrelenting force hellbent on destroying humanity. Just like the original. Over the decades the iconic beast has become a sort of anti-hero; showing up to fight other monsters and perhaps take out a few cities in the process. Gone was the sheer terror of its arrival. But GMO fixed that. And this Godzilla has weight... I mean when it moves and smashes buildings, you feel the impact of those moments. But perhaps the greatest thing about this film is the humans. These are not vapid peripheral characters put there just to take up screen time until the monster arrives. These characters have weight too... emotional weight. And they have arcs. No point in me going on about it, it's already getting critical praise. But a last note; I had to sit through 25 minutes of trailers before the film began. And not a one of them generated any interest ot caused a reaction in the theater. I'm not a Hollywood brasher because I know how difficult it is to get a production off the ground... but they better start upping their game. Japan just whupped their collective butts on a fraction of the cost of a typical US blockbuster production.",
    "97": "It's interesting how in the summer of 2023, people ironically watched \"Barbieheimer\". The pairing that actually makes the most sense for 2023 is a double feature of Oppenheimer followed by Godzilla Minus One. Both are epic stories about man versus nature, set on opposite sides of the atomic age, the second world war, and the line between history and historical fiction.This Godzilla has a unique style and tone. The movie's theme is about the horror and aftermath of war, comparing the conflict between US-Japan against the conflict between Japan-Godzilla.Most striking is the movie's understated style. As a Japanese film, the CGI is naturally more muted than what they produce in Hollywood. The movie is set in the late 1940s and they made the movie look like it was filmed in the 1950s. The score is riveting, combining the classic Godzilla themes with modern epic themes. The characters act like real people, not like caricatures typical of most superhero films.I'm very pleased to have watched the movie at a theater. I only wish I had seen it earlier when it was shown in the larger auditoriums.",
    "98": "*Welcome the King, the great one, Godzilla. Born from the ashes of atomic war, Godzilla Minus One is THE BEST Godzilla movie ever made, yes it is the best movie in the series, the best Kaiju Movie, and one of the best movies of 2023.*This movie truly blew me away, from the opening shot to the final epic battle, there are so many amazing action set pieces in this movie. The last 3 American Godzilla films pales in comparison to this movie. This is THE ONLY GODZILLA film you need to see, if you are only interested in one of them.*The acting is great for the most part, but there are some overdramatic moments, nothing new to Japanese entertainment. The action if AMAZING, all of the action is amazing.*You HAVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.*- The only downside is that there is a twist at the end that I kinda rolled my eyes at, and the movie could had cut maybe 10-15 minutes off and it would had been a lot smoother.9/10.",
    "99": "This is the real deal. Kamikaze pilot who chickened out at the end of WWII has repeated confrontations with: 1) his feelings of failure for not sacrificing himself in the Big One; and 2) one hell of a monster in Godzilla, who only enhances himself after a close call with the Bikini A Bomb test. Along the way our hero returns to a war torn Tokyo, and adopts a woman who has herself adopted a child among the ruins.The immediate post-war Tokyo is excellently portrayed, as is the platonic relationship between our hero and his charges. Our hero gets a job exploding live mines in the waters off Tokyo when the Big Guy returns much more buff then his first appearance and trashes the whole city. After another trashing of Tokyo things finally come to a head.As with any really good foreign movie, you forgot you were reading dialogue rather than hearing it about two minutes in. The cast is uniformly excellent. The story of our hero, the woman and the child is an interesting side story, along with the crew of the ship our hero works on.Watching a foreign movie was a breath of fresh air compared to the PC/woke-infested drivel spewed out by current US filmakers.",
    "100": "I guess you could call me a G-fan. And if you too are a G-fan, then you too must watch this movie.Of the 38 Godzilla films out there (Japanese + US), I've seen 36, but I own them all and have for a while now. Most G-fans know Shin Godzilla (2016) was a high point for the TOHO Godzilla films. We really wanted to see a sequel come off of that reboot for the franchise. Well TOHO had other ideas and decided to make Minus One instead.This film plus Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire sort of makes up the 70th anniversary of the Godzilla franchise. Along with the Apple TV+ MonsterVerse series.This movie had a significantly smaller budget than you're used to, not only for a Godzilla movie, but for movies in general. $15 million is difficult to fathom in modern times. And for the most part, the movie looks very competent. Shin Godzilla (2016) had set the standard for Japanese Godzilla film effects, but Minus One bests it.This film also has a much smaller scope than you're used to for a Godzilla film, but for me was a good point. Arguably when of the best human stories ever for a G-entry. This also go well with a miniscule budget, and this time you actually care for the protagonists.At 2 hours 10 minutes, this exceeds the typical kaiju sweet spot of 90 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes. There were some quiet/dialog scenes that dragged a little for me and for the first 2 thirds most events were fairly predictable. What I was NOT expecting were developments that came in the third act, which I will not spoil.The score utilizing the iconic OG Godzilla theme is off the chain. Most of the movie is not booming loud, but scenes featuring the original theme blew me away sonically and then some.As a nice chaser, if you are also a G-fan of the Legendary Pictures MonsterVerse movie, I would also recommend the Apple TV+ Monarch: Legacy of Monsters series.My quickie review on this movie and more can be found on our movie review podcast: Prognosis Negative, wherever you listen to podcasts.",
    "101": "Taking place in Post WWII Japan, Godzilla emerges and attacks Odo Island, killing everyone in the area except for kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima and plane mechanic Sosaku Tachibana. Two years later, Shikishima begins a to takes in Noriko Oishi and her adoptive daughter Akiko. He starts to build a relationship with Noriko as he continues to deal with survivor's guilt, but he soon comes face to face with his demons when Godzilla returns.Godzilla Minus One is epic. It has so much tension from both Godzilla and the human characters that it never gets old. This is by far my favorite version of Godzilla. This monster is frightening to the core and he is out for blood. He shows no mercy to civilians and destroys as much land as possible. He looks amazing and his atomic breath is jaw dropping. I was not ready for that atomic breath scene.The human characters are just as memorable. The main character, Shikishima is a war survivor who feels guilty about deserting his station. He is flawed and sympathetic with how he feels trapped with his experience of Godzilla's attack. He's flawed enough to feel human and just likable enough to root for. The supporting cast is just as good. Shikishima's friends are all very likable and contribute to the battle against Godzilla. Noriko, Shikishima's partner, is the most surprising for me. She seemed like she would be an annoying comic relief at first, but she is probably the most likable person. She acts as the heart of the film and gives hope for Shikishima's desperate situation. The story is consistently engaging and properly paced. It never feels like the pacing drags or goes too fast. It also has some great themes about life after war and nuclear destruction. I will say, this is not really a cheesy or comedic Godzilla film. There is hardly any humor at all. The story is played straight and that made me more engaged in the story. It worked for this film because of the themes and the characters.The visuals are awesome. Godzilla looks top-notch with his design, but it's his atomic breath that blew me away. The beam was to describe it best, calamitous. The action scenes are stunning as well. They are beautifully shot so we can enjoy them and follow them. They also remind us of how devastating Godzilla is, especially in this movie. The explosions are insane, with one in particular rivaling Oppenheimer this year. This movie has only a $15 Million budget yet it looks way better than any big budget Hollywood production this year. The soundtrack is awesome too. We have remix of the classic Godzilla theme and hearing it on the big screen felt so good.Godzilla Minus One gave me what I wanted from a Godzilla film. While I appreciate what the Monsterverse has brought us so far, this movie gives us the kind of Godzilla I want to see. It gave me what I felt was missing from the Godzilla films that I saw and more. This movie rocks. See it as soon as you can, especially if you are a Godzilla fan.",
    "102": "Godzilla Minus One is a classic case of film that is so much better than it has any right to be. I've yet to really have a film in this franchise really resonate with me but with how fantastic this movie turned out I think I finally understand the hype. The film goes out of its way to put character first and as someone who gets bored by these big CGI monster battles very easily I really appreciated that.Minus One takes a leaf out of the Jaws playbook and uses its central monster very sparingly. We get a really well done scene early on with Godzilla wrecking it's havoc in a way that sets it apart from other monster movies I've seen but the film then slows down to explore this central character. The character arcs and dynamics might be ones we've seen before but I really think it's the time period that makes it feel fresh. I haven't seen post war Japan explored much in cinema which is a shame because this film presented it in such an interesting way and I never would've expected this much historical depth from a Godzilla film. The script spends just as much time on developing the time period as it does the characters and it added a whole new level of stakes to these battle sequences where I usually would've just expected empty CGI noise.It's also supremely well shot with a great sense of scale and so many well executed, tension filled sequences. I would be amazed if the filmmakers weren't inspired by Dunkirk because it uses so many similar sequences to great effect. My favourite being an open sea chase with a mine sweeper trying to escape the titular monster. A lot has been made of the surprisingly low budget of this film and it is amazing to me the quality of the visual effects given that budget. Maybe Godzilla was featured sparingly because of the limited money but if so it honestly works so much better as a result. There was the occasional wonky effect but I'd rather have some iffy CGI in a film full of great characters than the inverse.I do think the film is a bit clunky in some regards. Every time the filmmakers cut away to news footage building up this threat, my attention started to wain because I just preferred seeing everything from the perspective of these characters. There's also a good 15-20 minute sequence before the climax that grinds the whole thing to a halt because it just feels like a prolonged exposition dump. There's a reveal made right towards the end of the film that I think some people will see as a bit of a cop out but I thought was executed wonderfully and could've fallen flat in a lesser film.I never would've expected a new Godzilla film in 2023 to be as fantastic as Minus One but this is honestly one of the biggest surprises I've had in a cinema all year. There were real tangible stakes, something that's been missing too often from movies like this, with a really interesting historical back drop that I'd love to see more of in mainstream cinema. If anything Minus One makes me like the Universal universes even less because I can't seem them ever competing with the quality Minus One presents.",
    "103": "A kamikaze pilot lands on Odo island in the final days of WWII, the bomb strapped to the bottom of his plane barely staying above the rocks peppered across the runway. Something is wrong with his vehicle, which is why he has diverted from his destination and hasn't been able to \"die honourably\"... or so he says. The mechanics can't find any faults with the aircraft, and the pilot's shaking hands do little to assuage their suspicions that he may have just been too \"cowardly\" to do his duty. Lost in his own thoughts, perched by the sea which laps at the ground near his feet, the pilot is approached by a young worker who tells him Japan needs more people like him. Before he can contemplate believing the man, he notices several deep sea fish floating belly up to the surface. How strange. As night falls, he returns to the nearby barracks. But there's a strange noise nearby, and nobody is prepared for what's making it. A watchtower turns it's light to the beach, where a hulking prehistoric monster is revealed in its light. Godzilla is here, and he isn't happy.So begins 'Godzilla Minus One (2023)', the latest in a long line of monster movies starring cinema's foremost Kaiju. The picture acts as a prequel to the previous Japanese 'Godzilla' films, although it's unclear if it also acts as something of a reboot, and - as you can tell from my description of the unconventional first scene - it also instantly takes things back to basics to much more closely emulate the original picture than its bevy of sequels or American remakes (including the on-going Monsterverse series). This Godzilla isn't a hero, he's a monster - or, perhaps, malevolent god - through and through. He isn't misunderstood, he doesn't go toe to toe with any other gigantic creatures, he isn't the unsung saviour of humanity, he's just big and mean and entirely uninterested in altering his path simply to avoid the destruction of entire cities and the deaths of thousands of people. What's more, he isn't the main character, and I can't stress enough how big of a deal that is. He isn't actually in the narrative all that much, and the human drama that drives the experience exists independently of him (although it obviously involves him in a significant way). The protagonist spends the piece wrestling with his self-perceived cowardice, his inability to do what was needed and therefore save lives. He isn't so much working to overcome a giant monster as he is working to overcome his own demons - primarily guilt - and allowing himself to live, to fully live, once more. It's a compelling arc that seamlessly weaves into the picture's rudimentary yet effective examination of the political landscape of post-war Japan. Much like the original 'Godzilla (1954)', the film is a reaction to the palpable terror felt at due to the threat of nuclear holocaust that would hang over the country - and the entire world - for decades to come. It also looks at how poorly Japan treated its soldiers and workers during the war and, while it never actually shows any US forces, it also looks at the struggles that the country endured during its American occupation. When push comes to shove, the only people who can save Japan from Godzilla's wrath are a band of scientists, engineers and mine-clearing sailors. America will not intervene for fear of provoking the Soviet Union with a military manoeuvre, whereas the Japanese government will not intervene because it refuses to take responsibility for the situation. The workers have to take things into their own hands, and - although it has a definite sense of national pride to it - the flick shows no love for neither the government (pre nor post war) nor the military. The feature's subtext and fairly nuanced character arcs are fairly unexpected considering that the few 'Godzilla' movies I've actually seen (the modern American ones) are mostly just mindless smash-'em-ups with weak human plots that come secondary to the weirdly weightless MUTO mayhem. Here, the human drama is what keeps you watching, not the promise of creature-feature devastation, and it's really compelling. It's perhaps the main reason why the disastrous set-pieces work as well as they do.That's not to imply that those sequences aren't everything you'd hope them to be. When the deep-sea destroyer returns after his post-prologue hiatus, he's much larger, much more powerful and much more ferocious. Powered-up by the USA's use of nuclear weaponry in and around Japan, he sets out on a collision course for Tokyo and doesn't stop until he's wreaked havoc on land. Backed by Akira Ifukube's monumental original score (arranged by Naoki Sato in various progressions used in some of the early sequels), the big bad lumbers around with a permanent scowl and an evil glaze over his unblinking eyes. Designed so that his movements resemble the suitmation used in the first film, his presence is tactile and utterly believable (the CGI is fantastic). Purposefully limiting his motion to resemble a man in a suit doesn't dampen his power, it just compounds the fact that he moves like that. His footsteps shake the earth (literally crush it in some cases), his tail whips through the landscape, his jaws crush whatever comes between them and his iconic roar tears through the sky. Don't even get me started on his atomic breath, which powers up with an ominous drone as the sharp spines on his back extend one by one, then shoots out in a short, sharp burst of bright blue fury and detonates a literal nuclear explosion that eviscerates anything in its radius and still triggers devastating shockwaves and skin-burning acid rain. It's horrific, legitimately scary stuff. Godzilla is as mean as he's ever been, and his violence truly is harrowing. You don't cheer for him, you fear him. That's what really stands out about this version, at least to me. I often found myself with my mouth hanging open, my palms beginning to sweat as a pit formed in my stomach. People die. A body count is explicitly mentioned in the aftermath of Godzilla's mid-movie attack, and we spend time with the collective grief such death causes. As the exciting finale approaches, the heroes' determination that no-one else is going to die seems like it must be in vain. How can mere morals defeat this force of nature?But there is hope. There's always hope. If the people of Japan can rebuild their country in the wake of war, they can surely rebuild it in the wake of this. After all, they have to. That is to say that the feature always retains an underlying optimism, something that perhaps gives you a hint towards its eventual predictability. No matter how conventional it eventually becomes, it always remains utterly compelling and entirely satisfying because it has laid the foundations to get you fully invested in its story. It does everything so very well that you're happy to overlook its few flaws, including its slightly baggy pacing and its occasionally heavy-handed flag-waving. It's a really enjoyable experience that inspires a whole bevy of emotions. It's the best monster movie I've seen in a long time.",
    "104": "Set immediately after the end of World War 2, Godzilla Minus One follows an ex soldier struggling with the horrors of loss while dealing with the threat of a monster unleashed onto Japan.The previous film in the franchise, Shin Godzilla, was a critique of the Japanese government's ineptitude during times of crisis. It was a more modern take with diverse cell phone footage of the creature, multiple office meetings between government officials to figure out how to deal with it, and it's actual size dwarfing any previous incarnation.Minus One scales everything back, simplifies it, and brings it down to earth. This is a very heartfelt film about the importance of human lives and how they're devalued en masse during periods of war.It looks at the scale of post war Japan from the perspective of the general public. Godzilla is less a metaphor for nuclear weapons this time around (though there are certainly still visuals that represent the atom bomb), but instead war's devastating effects on the common man.Speaking of Godzilla, the creature is possibly the smallest it's been in the history of the franchise, but that honestly works in favor of the horror. Human beings are not near invisible to the creature. Its focused on people and attacks them specifically. The actions of the characters have an actual tangible effect on Godzilla, and it hunts them down in return.Godzilla Minus One is easily among the best films in the franchise. Perhaps THE best since the original movie, for similar reasons; The creature is actually horrifying. Its metaphorical function is woven perfectly into the plot and themes. And the drama is so human, relatable, and effective that you're gripped from beginning to end.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. In theaters or on the biggest screen you possibly can to get the full scope. You won't regret it.",
    "105": "To put Godzilla in perspective in my house.We have two different Godzilla posters, one in my wife and I's bedroom. I have no idea how many toys we have. I am getting a tattoo of the poster for Godzilla vs King Ghidorah in a couple of weeks. So, you could call us experts on all things big lizard.I want to start by saying I have enjoyed the Legendary American Godzillas. They have done a wonderful job of answering the age-old question, \"What would a Godzilla film look like with a real budget?\" And make no mistake, Legendary is full of fans that know the formula, and follow it to a T. The results have been nothing but i enjoyable and fun.The problem here is, Toho has decided to create a new and better formula. This, is not a great Kaiju film, it's a great film. It deals with all kinds of heavy emotional territory, survivor's guilt, loss, PTSD, personal redemption, duty.... The film is a HARD tear-jerker. You heard me right, a Godzilla film that will wring tears out of anyone short of corpse status. Godzilla itself is returned to the roots, a force of nature, an analogy for the atomic bomb, it cares not about good or evil, it kills both with as much thought, none.There have been hints from Toho over the decades that they were and could be smarter than their reputation, the Cold War paranoia of Matango, the original Godzilla, the environmental message of Godzilla vs the Smog Monster, but this.... This is as smart and as heartfelt a film as you're watching all year, saying it's a kaiju film almost diminishes the film's stature.Unbelievable bit of filmmaking here.Hail to the King.",
    "106": "This film isn't just a great kaiju film, it's a great film...period. Takashi Yamazaki's script and direction are simply flawless. The characters are all so well developed and hopefully you'll find yourself emotionally attached to them as I did. I'm 51 years old, and while expecting a simple monster movie, I was floored but what Yamazaki delivered. I've never shed a tear in a movie theater ever, and I admit, I did tonight.The look and feel of a war torn Japan was spot on. It lends to the character's development and forms an intriguing basis for what each of their internal struggles really are.Believe it or not, the CGI is actually, while very good, the weakness of this film. This speaks to the overall excellence of the film.I know being a lifelong Godzilla fan, I just might be a bit biased, but Legendary could really use this type of template for their CGI-heavy films.I'll be seeing this again.",
    "107": "I have been a massive fan of the Godzilla franchise since my early childhood for more than two and a half decades by now. Some instalments have been above expectations, most have been fairly average and others have been somewhat disappointing. Godzilla Minus One however deserves its universal acclaim by fans and critics alike and is the franchise's greatest entry since at least The Return of Godzilla released thirty-nine years earlier. No matter if you are a fan of the franchise or not, this movie is highly recommended to anyone caring about well-crafted cinema in general as this film qualifies for one of the greatest movies of the year.There are several elements that make this particular entry stand out positively. First and foremost, the settings are authentic, captivating and dramatic. They manage to capture the bleak final days of the Second World War as well as the upcoming years of struggle in Japan. Viewers get to explore isolated islands in the Pacific Ocean, simplistic military facilities, gigantic warships and technically innovative planes, the poor suburbs of downtown Tokyo and its slowly growing modern suburbs. Despite its historical context, the movie never loses itself in inappropriate patriotism and instead decently criticizes some military decisions made back in those difficult times.Up next, the characters of this film are easy to identify with. The protagonist is a fearsome failed kamikaze pilot who feels guilt for his betrayal and shame for his existence. The female lead actress portrays a woman adopting the child of a dying mother just to save its life and offering it a better future. These two characters meet by pure coincidence in the devastated downtown sector of the capital and start developing feelings of responsibility, then friendship and ultimately love in the most tender manners. The movie features numerous intriguing supporting characters such as the slowly growing adopted daughter, a courageous, innovative and progressive captain and a bitter military technician with outstanding abilities. Every single character is fleshed out so profoundly that viewers will care about their fates and might even be longing to meet them again in future instalments.The special effects revolving around the titular monster are obviously what fans of the franchise have been anticipating most. Godzilla appears early in the movie and its nightmarish appearance will send shivers down the spine as the monster leaves a path of bleak destruction behind. The monster develops smoothly throughout the film as the viewers will learn more biological details about it step by step as the monster makes several short but intense appearances. The film's finale features Godzilla in all its gigantic monstrosity and comes around with a few captivating twists and turns. There is no doubt that Godzilla is the true star of this movie and this is exactly the way it should be.Many franchises have been repeating themselves to death and have been boring even the most adamant supporters time and again. The Godzilla franchise however is celebrating its seventh decade of existence and is still going strong as Japanese cinema manages to reinvent the most magnificent monster to have been put onto the big screen time and again without denying its historical roots and splendid details that make it so memorable. Teenagers will dig this movie as much as elderly people as this film offers historical fiction and science-fiction at its very best. Enjoy this movie for the whole family and make sure to support high-quality cinema by watching it in a comfortable movie theatre nearby.",
    "108": "For the 70th Anniversary of the series, Toho has gone back to the egg with GODZILLA MINUS ONE to create a movie that is much a remake of the orginal as it is a reboot.Taking place in the similar WWII time frame as the 1954 classic GOJIRA, Writer-Director Takashi Yamazaki melds many of the same themes with a more modern perspective. Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) is a fighter pilot who, in the waning days of the war, finds himself on an island with his troops -- and Godzilla. Returning to the devasted Japanese mainland, he forms an unlikely family unit with a young woman, Noriko Oishi (Minami Hamabe), and an orphaned baby, Akiko (Sae Nagatani). Godzilla eventually makes his way to Tokyo, seemingly growing stronger and more powerful as it moves along the way.Yamazaki's screenplay owes a lot to Takeo Murata and Inoshiro Honda's storyline from GOJIRA (Honda, of course, also directed), but he goes his own way in making the main characters more important than the fearsome beast (still he should have given a shared screen credit). The two films share the theme of self-sacrifice made even more crucial here because Shkishima was a kamikazee during the war. There is more overt criticism of the Japanese government than was likely possible back in the early 1950s.Yamizaki smartly seems to have used the perspective of almost eight decades of hindsight (not to mention the previous 30+ entries in the series) to make MINUS ONE feel freshly observed. One senses the notion that Japan will not only survive Godzilla - but, flourish with a hopeful future including that of becoming and economic and technological superpower themselves. It's a lot to pin on a 'monster picture', but it's largely earned. Some of the melodramatics lay it on a bit, but there's a genuine heart to the proceedings with the cast pulling off the human element convincingly.In another nod to 1954's GOJIRA, Yamizaki uses the famed Godzilla roar here if in a souped up form. Throughout MINUS ONE, Composer Naoki Sato weaves in music from original composer Akira Ifukube's masterful score to great effect. Ifukube's famed 'Godzilla Theme' has been used often in the intervening decades in the series. With MINUS ONE there's finally a film truly worthy of using it in full. Yamizaki has made a movie that can stand with GOJIRA.",
    "109": "Wow. Just wow.Cons first. Only complaint I can think of is that there were a few spots in the first and third quarters that were a tad slow.The rest was absolutely outstanding. Story, visuals, sound, acting, all excellent. The CGI was incredibly well done, and this rendition of Godzilla is friggen scary.Seeing it in IMAX made it all the better. I felt the roar and explosions in my molars, and the effects held up on the biggest screen I could find. I'm so blown away that this film's effects are as good and realistic as they are with a fraction of the budget Hollywood blockbusters have.If you want an excellent monster disaster film with effects that put basically everything Marvel has made in the past decade to shame, do not miss out on this one.",
    "110": "\"Godzilla Minus One\" is the 37th film in the Godzilla franchise and Toho's 33rd film overall. Written and directed Takashi Yamazaki and starring Ryunosuke Kamiki in the lead role, it pulls off the near impossible task of balancing harrowing human drama with that signature Godzilla mass destruction.In 1946 in Japan, kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) returns home to a ruined Tokyo after failing to stop the giant lizard-like monster Godzilla from killing the inhabitants of Odo Island. Still overcome with guilt, Koichi takes up a job as a minesweeper to support himself, as well as a homeless woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and the orphaned baby Akiko she rescued. Meanwhile, Godzilla has become more mutated and powerful as a result of America's nuclear tests in Bikini Atoll, and is now heading directly towards Japan. One year later, Koichi and his crew are given the task of preventing Godzilla from reaching the Japanese mainland, and despite some initial success, Godzilla quickly breaks through their blockade. Upon making landfall, Godzilla unleashes a fury of destruction on the city of Ginza, killing tens of thousands of people in the process. Shocked by the carnage left in its wake, Koichi vows revenge against Godzilla and soon find himself working on a plan to take out the gargantuan monster once and for all.If there were ever a more iconic giant movie monster that didn't come from Hollywood, it would have to be Godzilla of course. For almost seven decades, this colossal reptilian has stomped its way through cities around the world and battled other large monsters (\"Kaijus\") of similar size using its physical strength and atomic breath. But what many may not know is the real reason why Godzilla was created at all, and that was for it to serve as an allegory for the misuse of nuclear weapons post-World War II. This metaphor is at the forefront of the 2023 film \"Godzilla Minus One\", which not only features some clever social commentary regarding Japan's future in the nuclear age, but also a lineup of well-written characters and great special effects to help things along nicely.Separating itself considerably from most other movies of its type, this film actually has a three-dimensional human protagonist for the audience to support. Our hero Koichi is World War II kamikaze pilot, whose job was to fly his plane into the enemy, killing himself in the process. However, Koichi cannot bring himself to go through with this literal suicide mission and upon returning home is labelled as a dishonourable coward by those around him. Throughout the film, we see Koichi experiencing survivor's guilt due to him being indirectly responsible for many deaths at the hands of Godzilla, and he finds himself in constant conflict with his emotions.A set-up like this is particularly interesting, because it shows a unique perspective of what the Japanese perceive as courageous. In their culture, the Japanese believe that surrendering to an enemy victory is an act of cowardice, so in addition to his PTSD of letting others die, Koichi also has the burden of his country's high expectations to once again prove himself worthy to their cause. By watching Koichi work desperately to overcome both his guilt and shame, we see him grow as a person over the course of the film, allowing for a rather in-depth character arc that is not usually seen to this extent in giant monster movies. Because of this, the audience now has a believable, sympathetic main character for them to cheer for against all opposition.Something else worth mentioning here is that it is not just Koichi who has a lot to benefit from growing throughout the story, but also the plethora of supporting characters he comes into contact with. For instance, many of Koichi's minesweeper crew are former members of the Japanese navy, who are each trying to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of their country's bitter defeat in World War II. One crew member never even had the chance to see combat but still wants to help out wherever he can. With so much to prove after losing the War, all of these brave men work tirelessly around the clock to protect their homeland from an outside threat, only this time from a giant lizard creature instead of a global superpower. I couldn't help but admire the sense of public duty each of these men have for their country, which is not often seen outside of a typical war film, and watching it demonstrated so effectively in Godzilla movie of all things is nothing short of impressive.Of course, aside from all these heavy-handed themes and character motivations, it just wouldn't be a Godzilla film without what everyone pays to see in the first place - the chaos and destruction. For any doubters, there are still plenty of scenes of the iconic monster crashing its way through buildings, biting into warships like they were food, and blasting away large areas with its signature atomic breath. It's worth noting that this Godzilla is a bit smaller than other incarnations, as it still relatively young and hasn't yet grown to full size. Despite that, I still really liked Godzilla's design and the film's special effects used to bring it to life. Essentially, Godzilla is treated like a force of nature acting on its youthful animalistic instincts rather than as a calculating villain, with anyone or anything in its path likely to meet an untimely end.As the film takes place just after World War II, the human weaponry to fight back against Godzilla is exclusively limited to that particular time period, with no modern day artillery available at their dispersal. To make matters worse, despite being responsible for its creation, the Americans refuse to assist Japan in stopping Godzilla at the risk of causing tension with the nearby Soviet Union. This leaves Japan with no other choice but to fight Godzilla all by themselves, with only their intellect and home field advantage as their aces in the hole. Because of that, you really get the sense that the Japanese are the underdogs in this fight, exacerbated by the fact that they are still in the process of rebuilding their country after World War II.For a character like Koichi, Ryunosuke Kamiki brings an appropriate level of dimension to his performance in the main role. As mentioned earlier, Koichi is not just battling Godzilla, he is also grappling with his own inner turmoil. Often times he is haunted by his past mistakes and the longing to fix them before he completely loses his mind. Kamiki does a great job showing the array of emotions Koichi is going through, ranging from reserved shame for his past actions to intense anger for what Godzilla has done to those he cares about. He holds a personal vendetta against Godzilla, and like Captain Ahab hunting Moby Dick, he becomes obsessed with destroying the giant Kaiju as a way to achieve peace of mind. Watching Koichi develop throughout the story is one of the film's biggest strengths, and it is balanced out near-flawlessly with the usual scenes of Godzilla destroying things.From the viewpoint of a casual fan, \"Godzilla Minus One\" ranks among the most entertaining and emotionally deep monster movies ever made. Having only watched a handful of movies in the series, I have to admit it's quite refreshing to find one this well-made with likeable, interesting human characters in addition to everything else one would expect. To my surprise, this movie was made on a budget of less than $15 million, far lower than most of the Hollywood features rushed out to theatres these days. Western movie studios should take note because this is clearly how action films should be made instead of the same over-produced and over-priced content they continue to churn out every year. After all, if the Japanese can do it, then surely the west can follow suit.I rate it a solid 9/10.",
    "111": "Good? Yes. Great? Possibly, but let's temper expectations. Definitely the better if not the best Godzilla of the 2000's but it's not perfect. I love that Toho has been willing to give filmmakers different takes on Godzilla. My favorite era is Showa Godzilla. However, this isn't the hero or monster fighting monster Godzilla movie. Nor is it a fantasy sci-fi pulp action movie. This is a sober Godzilla, a force of nature Godzilla, which isn't new but is a fantastic flavor to the series and a bit of a crowd pleaser.It's a throwback to the original and it feels fresh. Every Godzilla scene is powerful, exhilarating. But this isn't the agile Godzilla that breaths atomic breath at ease. By comparison, this can be a bit slow and plodding Godzilla, whose atomic breath needs revving up and literally as powerful as atomic bombs. Even that atomic depiction isn't new, GMK and Shin Godzilla use this, but was this was more impactful to me. Less of a personality (but not as odd or bland as Shin Godzilla) and more a force of nature, it's Japan's living nuclear terror.Composer Naoki Sato gives the movie a chilling and fitting atmospheric music. I like that they used one of Godzilla's original themes and roar. But Sato doesn't match original Godzilla composer Akira Ifukube's powerful bombastic themes and originality. Then again, who can match that genius? Sato used a theme from 1962's King King vs. Godzilla, which to me is a bit of an odd choice, making me think of Kong's villagers. But generally, it worked. At times I'd think Ifukube's \"Frigate March\" would be more fitting however.The main character and story are developed well enough. Acting is good (enough) too. The main theme is a post-war survivor's drama. And this makes up a majority of the screen time. The secondary characters are alright but aren't as deep. The way the Japanese fight Godzilla appears to be a bit of an interesting throwback variation too but doesn't dwell on itself meaningfully the way the 1954 movie does. Will it work? \"I don't know, I hope so, let's try it\" is the sentiment.In the end, I felt director/writer Takashi Yamazaki wrote a good drama but a crowd pleaser, thus lacking the sober emotionally sacrificial impact the 1954 version brought. Not to really spoil anything but two characters were given \"cop out\" happy endings and I actually felt a little disappointed by this. Then again, the story wasn't really building to be anything otherwise so maybe I shouldn't be complaining. The only other thing I wished they had hammered in harder is a more explicit or sappier embracing on the \"father-daughter\" relationship of Akiko and Shikishima. Just wasn't enough for me. Frankly, the relationship between Oishi and Shikishma was genuine but also kind of underplayed. Maybe I've seen too many movies and getting too tired of the same thing but the greatest emotional impact was seeing Godzilla's atomic breath. Not Shikishima's emotional story beats.So, Godzilla Minus one is a fresh throwback, a decent drama, and the true Japanese Godzilla as he or it should be depicted. Generally, a well-polished, respectable Godzilla movie in 2023 for the franchise. Good? Yes. Great? Possibly, but definitely memorable.Trivia: This isn't director Takashi Yamazaki's first movie with Godzilla in it. Actually, he gave the King of the Monsters a short cameo at the beginning of the nostalgic series - Always: Sunset on Third Street 2. Another movie I loved more.P.s. I also had to rewrite this damn review over again because my internet failed and my first draft got deleted. :P.",

He creates a pseudo-family with a woman and child who were also orphaned by the war. They build a home and do their best to make a life for the little girl. The country of Japan and the family are prospering until Godzilla makes his way toward them, destroying everything in his path. The pilot and the citizens decide not to allow the country to be destroyed again and band together to stop Godzilla. The pilot has the opportunity to complete his mission original mission and regain his honor.This is a terrific Godzilla movie with classic and modern features. The story focuses on the people of Japan, their lives after the war, and how it changes their mindset and approach to defending the country from Godzilla. The movie is spoken in Japanese with subtitles and some slow parts, but is satisfying in the end. This movie is excellent for Godzilla fans or anyone looking for something different to watch in theaters.",
    "113": "The Japanese have seemed to learn something about giant monster films (I guess, having essentially perfected the genre in the 20th century) that their American counterparts have not. Yes, the big monster fights, the wanton destruction, and the impossible odds matter. But in reality, what makes a great kaiju film - and this is apparent from the 1954 original Godzilla film - is that the \"monster\" is an allegory. The monster allows you to communicate complex ideas in a digestible way. It's not about bigger monsters or more CG laden fights; it's about theme and messaging.The last two live action Godzilla films I've seen from Japan - Shin Godzilla and Minus One - are less about \"Godzilla\" as much as they are about very human struggles. The former tackles the absurdity of government incompetence and petty politics during a crisis. Minus One, set immediately after the surrender of the Japan after defeat in the Second World War, tackles grief, guilt, and rebuilding, both on an individual and societal level.For much of the film, Minus One feels like a sober period drama, with truly excellent performances from lead Ryonosuke Kamiki (a failed kamikaze pilot turned unsung hero Shikishima) and Minami Hamabe (his kinda/sorta love interest Noriko), who deliver powerful emotion everytime their on screen. But it's the side cast, the men Shikishima meets who bring him back from the brink that really sell this movie for me. For all the darkness and devastation, this is a \"pro-human\" film; whereas Shin Godzilla cast doubt and aspersion about our ability to come together, Minus One proclaims proudly that we can and we do more often than you'd think. I was pleasantly surprised - and very happy - that this film lacked a human villain. Set in the darkly gorgeous ruins of post-war Japan, the cruelty humanity can display (on both sides) was apparent and didn't need to be hammered home.At the end of the day, why do you need a sub villain when GODZILLA is your antagonist? Unlike the American versions that constantly ask us to \"like\" Godzilla to sell toys, the Japanese understand what Godzilla really is: a morally indifferent force of nature that does not care. To say this film's depiction of Godzilla is TERRIFYING would be an understatement. He is immeasurably powerful and destructive, and exerts no effort in levelling an entire district of Tokyo. You really feel like the humans are serious underdogs and can't help but cheer when they prevail, because it's honestly unfair how mismatched they are. I also loved the King of Monster's design; his weird exoskeleton is reminiscent of a sea creature, which was appropriate considering how much of this film (brilliantly) takes place on the high seas. (I think the subtext of Japan, a former naval superpower being on the defensive was fantastic as well)All of this is tied together with a phenomenal score, which goes from triumphant to honestly unsettling at times. The classic Godzilla theme has never sounded so good.Yeah, believe the hype. Minus One rules. I'm happy to see it be so successful in North America, and *hopefully* it can remind Hollywood that the best blockbusters are ones with brains and heart.",
    "114": "The UK release of \"Godzilla Minus One\" is, for some reason, a bit after the US and Japanese releases. I went to a Cineworld Unlimited preview screening last night and really enjoyed it. It's a combination of action and emotion that you rarely see so well balanced.Koichi Shikshima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) returns from World War Two guilt ridden both as he was a Kamikaze pilot that refused the mission and also his inaction during an interaction with Godzilla cost several men their lives. He slowly builds a life with Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and Akiko (Sae Nagatani) their adopted daughter. He works on a minesweeper, but when reports of a much larger Godzilla heading towards Japan come out, they're asked to slow him down.Whereas American studios have generally gone for the spectacle of him, Japanese producers have used Godzilla as a cypher to explore the national reactions. This time it's the loss of the second world war. Koichi is literally told that his cowardice is the reason they lost and why people were killed in bombing raids. The Government later unwilling to participate in any form of military actions, for fear of angering the US and it falls to a \"dads army\" of former soldiers to try and engage him.There's a lot of 'family drama' in the film, but never did I feel that the film dragged in those sections. The performances are really good, particularly from Kamiki, who is in virtually every scene of the film. I also enjoyed the crew on board the Shinsei Maru. The Godzilla scenes themselves though are great, and it's hard not to get a real charge during the Ginza scenes, when the original theme hits. Godzilla in this really is essentially a giant animal, exploring his territory and defending it against intruders, he only resorts to extreme measures, like the fire breath, when attacked.I really enjoyed it and would recommend it and I hope that Takashi Yamazaki gets to make another one. I'll also be looking back into what I can see of his back catalogue.",
    "115": "The giant green one's triumphant return currently in theaters. Shooting back to his origins, nuclear testing which engineered his aberration & focusing on a failed kamikaze pilot, Ryunosuke Kamiki, who lands on a remote island for repairs is soon ensconced by an attack, along w/the stationed mechanics, which decimates their stronghold. Making it back to the mainland, Kamiki finds his hometown destroyed w/only his neighbor still around who takes a stab at him for not sacrificing himself for the cause but things take a turn when rebuilding starts & Kamiki befriends a single mother, Minami Hamabe, & her daughter & they become a defacto family w/Kamiki trying to normalize his life by finding a job on a boat as mine finder where they encounter the giant lizard again who attacks them which they survive but then Godzilla hits their town & in an act of sacrifice Hamabe pushes Kamiki out of the way of an onslaught which fortifies Kamiki's resolve to get behind the pilot seat again for a bombing run on Godzilla (after the town's leaders come up w/a plan to kill Godzilla using the bends & freon in the ocean) as a last ditch effort if all else fails. Partnered w/the equally great Shin Godzilla from a few years ago, this shows how to do a giant monster movie the right way (especially coming out on the heels of the new Godzilla/King Kong trailer which may look entertaining but definitely feels bloated) w/the emphasis on the human factor being paramount but also not forgetting the devastating impact of Godzilla's destruction of cities & infrastructure. Can we also mention the fact this film had a 15 million dollar budget when the American counterparts run easily skyward into the hundreds? Take a page of this book, Hollywood!",
    "116": "There have been many versions of the Godzilla mythology, but, in my opinion, Godzilla Minus One is one of the best I've seen. It's a Japanese-language film, and it's surprisingly explicit in its critique of various aspects of Japan's approach to its past history in wartime. It's commentary on war and nuclear power, symbolised by the post-war emergence of Godzilla, is powerful. And the themes of loss, survival, and hope add emotional depth.The story focuses primarily on Sosaku Tachibana, a fighter pilot, who has managed to avoid his fate as a kamikaze pilot by avoiding action altogether. At one point in the film, it is noticed that his plane hasn't been damaged. The guilt of not fulfilling his orders, including not defending his colleagues against Godzilla early in the story, haunts him, and his internal struggles with this are constantly present as the story unfolds.The other characters are also well-developed and very relatable, bringing a sense of stability in the middle of the chaos. This adds a deeply human element to the story, which focuses more on the humans than the action and special effects, giving us a reason to empathise with and care about these characters rather than just seeking the thrills that come with this genre.Having said that, though, the visual effects in Godzilla Minus One are stunning and bring Godzilla, a very intimidating monster, to life with realism and fine detail. And the action sequences are intense and exciting. Godzilla really feels powerful and destructive as it goes on its rampages.Some viewers may find the plot a bit predictable. But the Godzilla mythology is well-embedded among many filmgoers, so that may increase the sense of predictability. And occasionally, it is obvious that CGI has been used, so there are moments when things seem a bit artificial. And there is not much humour to lighten the relentless sadness and fear of the storyline.If you are a fan of monster movies and action films, and especially of the Godzilla story, go and see Godzilla Minus One. It delivers what it promises when it comes to spectacular visuals and intense action. The explicit exploration of themes of war and loss is handled well.",
    "117": "Man, I've been looking forward to this one! In the wake of a struggling American cinema, Japan graces us with a brand-new kaiju film that shockingly impressed Western audiences left and right. That, folks, is \"Godzilla Minus One\".Plot: A few years after WW2, disgraced kamikaze pilot Shikishima struggles to settle down with his new family and friends. However, a ghost from the past has returned to haunt him as well as the nation, the saurian Godzilla, mutated by nuclear radiation. As the monster vents his rage and plunges Japan in despair, Shikishima and his cohorts face their inner demons and unite to defend their homeland when no one else could.This film is cinematic in every possible way. The story tackles the trauma the Japanese people had to deal with after the war head-on: failures on top of a crippling defeat, personal loss, government failings, and economic decline. Shikishima is a great protagonist, wracked with guilt to the point of reoccurring nightmares yet deep down wants to make amends and help those close to him towards a brighter future, helped by his lovable bunch of companions with their own distinct personalities and insecurities who also served during the war. The drama and interpersonal conflicts are powerful, really making you feel their turmoil, so much so that even when the monster isn't around for a long stretch, they keep you engaged (I actually heard someone in the audience crying from such scenes!). All this serves to emphasize the theme of living and rebuilding after such harrowing times.As for Godzilla, he's presented as an aggressive territorial animal. He feels huge yet personal, his mere presence spine-chilling and power very impactful. This is helped by haunting music (though you still get the classic theme) and equally scary imagery and hard-hitting violence (not overtly bloody, mind you, but enough to leave an impression). There were even moments where it felt like \"Jaws\" in a good way. The times when he uses his atomic breath alone are straight up jaw-dropping. The army's battles with the kaiju are also done well, a good amount of destruction and utter fear, with a climax that's creative in its concept and execution. All this spectacle is done with excellent special effects despite being a fraction of the usual American budget these days; I could practically count every scale on Big G.All in all, \"Godzilla Minus One\" is a must-see that is well-deserved of the large amount of praise it's getting. Not only does it present the monster in a scary light that borders on horror, but it also has human characters that keep your attention, not to mention great music, effects, action, and story. My only slight critique is that the second half does drag a little. I should note that, as of the timing of this review, it's in Japanese with English subtitles, though the actors use a lot of facial expressions to convey the right emotions even when not talking. It gets my recommendation to those who haven't seen it. Long live the King of the Monsters!",
    "118": "The Godzilla Minus One is the best movie from all Godzilla series from any type of monsters movies.What is important to have in movies is characters developing and motivation during from start of movie though end.Even some previous of Godzilla movies did not had good human characters building up and I'm did not get the feeling any of characters until now with Godzilla Minus one is got humanity touch and did amazingly done.Yamazaki's work as director and also as screenwriter did marvelous work. With drama, tension and sadness and destruction.Differently watch this movie on cinema! I highly recommended.",
    "119": "Godzilla Minus One doesn't even need Godzilla to succeed. Takashi Yamazaki's film is set in post World War II Japan, following a failed kamikaze pilot haunted by trauma and guilt, which manifests in the form of a destructive behemoth from the sea. The film stars Minami Hamabe and Kamiki Ryunosuke.The film is at its peak when it's a character study of a devastated Japan. Outside of the action scenes with Godzilla, the other half of the film is balanced well with compelling characters. Even with English subtitles, American audiences feel the emotional weight and turmoil of the actors' performances as their characters navigate the reconstruction of their lives. While I expected an epic action film, I was completely surprised by a poignant character-driven story. Showing the many conflicting viewpoints of the Japanese people through its characters, the film ultimately argues against the senseless loss of human life that was seen during WWII.Godzilla can be perceived as a symbol of death and destruction as the film brings the iconic reptilian monster back to its roots, unlike many of the recent American Godzilla films. Presented as a force of nature, Godzilla shows no remorse as it crushes people and buildings. Right as the struggles that the characters face seem to be coming to a resolution, Godzilla steps in with its atomic breath, a clear allegory for the atomic bomb and its destructive power. Since strong characters are established, the audience actually feels sadness when Godzilla mows through civilization.While the film had a tiny budget of 15 million dollars (compare that to Godzilla vs. Kong's nearly 200 million dollar budget), the visual effects were still effective. Though there were a few shaky shots, Godzilla's monstrous size came across nicely, creating thrilling action scenes. These action scenes were elevated further by the sturdy emotional core of the film.It should be noted that the film's back half wasn't nearly as compelling as its first half. The first hour of the film had a well balanced mix of action and drama. Unfortunately, the action takes a backseat during the last hour and the drama doesn't pack as much of a punch. The film also doesn't fully commit to some of its plot points, lessening the impact of some heartbreaking character moments. But, the film does eventually reach an explosively satisfying conclusion.Oddly, some may take issue with the film's inclusion of Godzilla. The character study aspect does stand on its own two feet and could've been made even better if it were solely focused on. Then again, a story about a pilot overcoming his guilt and creating a family wouldn't bring as big of an audience to theaters. In my opinion, Godzilla isn't totally unnecessary as its presence reinforces the film's messaging and metaphors.Godzilla Minus One not only succeeds at reinvigorating the terror in Godzilla but it also serves as a gripping presentation of a country pulling together to rebuild a past life. The synthesis of heart and action creates one of, if not the best, monster-centered action films.",
    "120": "The BankofMarquis just viewed one of the most entertaining films of 2023 - and it's a GODZILLA film.Yes, a GODZILLA film.From famed Japanese Studio Toho, makers of the original Godzilla film from the 1950's plus other \"man in a rubber suit\" monster movies like MOTHRA and WAR OF THE GARGANTUANS, Godzilla Minus One subverts the genre for a moment for instead of presenting a \"Monster stomping on buildings\" movie with some people in the background, this film is about the Japanese people and how they deal with the aftermath of World War II while (also) running from a giant monster stomping on buildings - but the monster story is the \"B\" story and the people story is the \"A\" story...and this subversion of the genre works very very well.The title of the film, Godzilla Minus One, refers to the fact that...after World War II.... Japan was \"starting from zero\". When Godzilla starts attacking, it knocks Japan back another peg, hence...Godzilla Minus One.Director and Screenwriter Takashi Yamazaki tells the tale of Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki) who encounters Godzilla towards the end of WWII and freezes, causing the death of his fellow soldiers (so his PTSD continues to tell him throughout the film). Once back in Japan, he encounters a young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe) who has been left orphaned, homeless and alone and is sheparding an abandoned baby. This unlikely trio form a bond...and a home...while trying to rebuild their lives and (in Koichi's case) tries to make sense of the devastation he encountered in the war.Into to this rebuilding stomps Godzilla.This story is effectively told by Yamazaki, who knows when to focus on the people aspect of the film and when to focus on the building stomping of Godzilla. It's a delicate balance that is helped by the performances of Kamiki and Hamabe...and the special effects that brings the spirit of the 1950's and 1960's Toho monster films to light.A surpwisingly rich entertainment, Godzilla Minus One will entertain you with monster stomping...and deep human emotion.Letter Grade: A- (I'm as surprised as you are)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",
    "121": "Godzilla Minus One is virtually perfect, just as good as everyone is saying it is.Minus One is essentially a remake of the original Godzilla. Even the science fantasy plan to destroy the monster is a variation on the plan from the original, albeit somewhat less silly. Also like the original, a thematic focus of Minus One is the collective trauma which immediately follows a catastrophe. Interestingly, rather than staging the atomic bombs as the backdrop of that trauma, as in the original Godzilla, the trauma here, and in fact the physical setting in the first part of the movie, is Tokyo after the notorious fire bombing by the United States.Into the collective and immediate trauma, Minus One folds the post-traumatic trauma of its main protagonist, while also playing on the theme of redemption. The motivation behind this character's trauma is the conflict between that expectation of fulfilling one's duty that is so particular to Japanese culture, particularly WWII military culture, and specifically the duty to die expected of kamikaze pilots.If all of that seems rather intense for a \"mere\" monster movie, well, there is nothing \"mere\" about this flick. All of that depth is perfectly delivered through excellent acting from top to bottom (I teared up twice during this movie, something I have never done watching a kaiju), genuine character development, even among secondary characters, and impeccable direction. The choice of camera distance from characters, camera placement and angles, and the judicious use of slow motion, all contribute to that depth, too. Regarding slow motion: I generally hate it because it is so rarely used effectively and so often used in a cheesy, eye rolling way. As much as I love the Lord of the Rings trilogy, there are only one or two moments across all 11 and 1/2 hours that were made more effective through slow motion. The rest of those slow mo moments are the weakest shots in the entire trilogy. The exact opposite is the case here. Somehow, director Takashi Yamazaki uses slow motion several times with each moment being effective and affecting. One particularly brilliant use of slow motion combines it with screen silence. Yamazaki pulls out all the stops.The score is equally compelling. During some sequences, it's almost creepy, certainly atmospheric in a very non-action movie kind of way. It lends those moments a gravitas completely lacking in the blaring, heavy-handed scores of every American Godzilla movie. Composer Naoki Sato even works in Akira Ifukube's famous, doomy leitmotif, but does so sparingly. His score is as impeccable as Yamazaki's directing.Finally, the special effects. Unlike the cartoonish, glowy, neon CG of the American Godzilla movies of the last 10 years or so, Minus One's monster is naturalistic. It looks like an animal be it a horrifying, almost supernatural one. Similarly, the buildings and their destruction is less spectacle and more catastrophic devastation, more appropriately reflecting the damage done by the fire bombing and the atomic bombs.I don't often write such long reviews, but this movie knocked my socks off. I will buy it when it's available on disc, also not something I often do with newer movies.",
    "122": "Ok, I'm going to start off by saying, I'm not a big fan of the Godzilla lore. I have not seen a lot of the Godzilla movies. I've seen a few before, but nothing that really stuck out to me. Decided to see this in the theater today, because I have heard a lot of good reviews on it from different people. This movie is really really good. The people behind making this Godzilla movie looks like they put lot of heart and love and work and passion to getting this made, taking things back to basics maybe. The human characters, wow, just wow. You know, in alot of these types of films, the monster doing the smashing is the main setup, and a lot of times, the human characters are not even that interesting at all. But in Godzilla Minus One, the human characters , the main character, Koichi Shikishima, is a very compelling interesting character dealing with past trauma, guilt, and a desire to escape his mistakes. The other main characters are also very interesting, and you feel that you care about what happens to them. From the the start of the movie to the very end, I was totally invested, cared about the other characters stories , and wondering how they were going to survive. Godzilla's design I really liked here quite a bit. Godzilla in this is a total force of nature, a primal ,killing, wrecking machine. Very very curious to see if this filmmaker will continue with another Godzilla movie, if he does, I'm definitely watching that too.",
    "123": "They revisited the first film for Godzilla and put an interesting story line behind it. The viewer becomes attached to the human characters in the film and Godzilla, while Godzilla himself is reduced to the level of pure jerk. Godzilla in other films fought and defeated other monsters, as a kind of hero, but that's not the case here. This version is simply bare bones survival for the humans. The special effects are some of the best I've seen in films. The depiction of post war Tokyo was awesome. Right down to the details of what transit trains looked like and how they were built in that era. A lot of research went into this film to make the audience accept the back ground as realistic. One of the hero's of the film was a fighter plane called the Shinden (Superfortress Interceptor), which really did exist as a secret weapon against the U. S. As a kid, I built a model of this plane, so I knew what it could do. The only let down was the dismissal of American forces during this time period. The excuse used was that American involvement could trigger a conflict with the Soviets, which I don't believe. If you've never seen a Godzilla film, this one is worth the time.",
    "124": "Wow. Just wow.Cons first. Only complaint I can think of is that there were a few spots in the first and third quarters that were a tad slow.The rest was absolutely outstanding. Story, visuals, sound, acting, all excellent. The CGI was incredibly well done, and this rendition of Godzilla is friggen scary.Seeing it in IMAX made it all the better. I felt the roar and explosions in my molars, and the effects held up on the biggest screen I could find. I'm so blown away that this film's effects are as good and realistic as they are with a fraction of the budget Hollywood blockbusters have.If you want an excellent monster disaster film with effects that put basically everything Marvel has made in the past decade to shame, do not miss out on this one.",
    "125": "\"Godzilla Minus One\" is the 37th film in the Godzilla franchise and Toho's 33rd film overall. Written and directed Takashi Yamazaki and starring Ryunosuke Kamiki in the lead role, it pulls off the near impossible task of balancing harrowing human drama with that signature Godzilla mass destruction.In 1946 in Japan, kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) returns home to a ruined Tokyo after failing to stop the giant lizard-like monster Godzilla from killing the inhabitants of Odo Island. Still overcome with guilt, Koichi takes up a job as a minesweeper to support himself, as well as a homeless woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and the orphaned baby Akiko she rescued. Meanwhile, Godzilla has become more mutated and powerful as a result of America's nuclear tests in Bikini Atoll, and is now heading directly towards Japan. One year later, Koichi and his crew are given the task of preventing Godzilla from reaching the Japanese mainland, and despite some initial success, Godzilla quickly breaks through their blockade. Upon making landfall, Godzilla unleashes a fury of destruction on the city of Ginza, killing tens of thousands of people in the process. Shocked by the carnage left in its wake, Koichi vows revenge against Godzilla and soon find himself working on a plan to take out the gargantuan monster once and for all.If there were ever a more iconic giant movie monster that didn't come from Hollywood, it would have to be Godzilla of course. For almost seven decades, this colossal reptilian has stomped its way through cities around the world and battled other large monsters (\"Kaijus\") of similar size using its physical strength and atomic breath. But what many may not know is the real reason why Godzilla was created at all, and that was for it to serve as an allegory for the misuse of nuclear weapons post-World War II. This metaphor is at the forefront of the 2023 film \"Godzilla Minus One\", which not only features some clever social commentary regarding Japan's future in the nuclear age, but also a lineup of well-written characters and great special effects to help things along nicely.Separating itself considerably from most other movies of its type, this film actually has a three-dimensional human protagonist for the audience to support. Our hero Koichi is World War II kamikaze pilot, whose job was to fly his plane into the enemy, killing himself in the process. However, Koichi cannot bring himself to go through with this literal suicide mission and upon returning home is labelled as a dishonourable coward by those around him. Throughout the film, we see Koichi experiencing survivor's guilt due to him being indirectly responsible for many deaths at the hands of Godzilla, and he finds himself in constant conflict with his emotions.A set-up like this is particularly interesting, because it shows a unique perspective of what the Japanese perceive as courageous. In their culture, the Japanese believe that surrendering to an enemy victory is an act of cowardice, so in addition to his PTSD of letting others die, Koichi also has the burden of his country's high expectations to once again prove himself worthy to their cause. By watching Koichi work desperately to overcome both his guilt and shame, we see him grow as a person over the course of the film, allowing for a rather in-depth character arc that is not usually seen to this extent in giant monster movies. Because of this, the audience now has a believable, sympathetic main character for them to cheer for against all opposition.Something else worth mentioning here is that it is not just Koichi who has a lot to benefit from growing throughout the story, but also the plethora of supporting characters he comes into contact with. For instance, many of Koichi's minesweeper crew are former members of the Japanese navy, who are each trying to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of their country's bitter defeat in World War II. One crew member never even had the chance to see combat but still wants to help out wherever he can. With so much to prove after losing the War, all of these brave men work tirelessly around the clock to protect their homeland from an outside threat, only this time from a giant lizard creature instead of a global superpower. I couldn't help but admire the sense of public duty each of these men have for their country, which is not often seen outside of a typical war film, and watching it demonstrated so effectively in Godzilla movie of all things is nothing short of impressive.Of course, aside from all these heavy-handed themes and character motivations, it just wouldn't be a Godzilla film without what everyone pays to see in the first place - the chaos and destruction. For any doubters, there are still plenty of scenes of the iconic monster crashing its way through buildings, biting into warships like they were food, and blasting away large areas with its signature atomic breath. It's worth noting that this Godzilla is a bit smaller than other incarnations, as it still relatively young and hasn't yet grown to full size. Despite that, I still really liked Godzilla's design and the film's special effects used to bring it to life. Essentially, Godzilla is treated like a force of nature acting on its youthful animalistic instincts rather than as a calculating villain, with anyone or anything in its path likely to meet an untimely end.As the film takes place just after World War II, the human weaponry to fight back against Godzilla is exclusively limited to that particular time period, with no modern day artillery available at their dispersal. To make matters worse, despite being responsible for its creation, the Americans refuse to assist Japan in stopping Godzilla at the risk of causing tension with the nearby Soviet Union. This leaves Japan with no other choice but to fight Godzilla all by themselves, with only their intellect and home field advantage as their aces in the hole. Because of that, you really get the sense that the Japanese are the underdogs in this fight, exacerbated by the fact that they are still in the process of rebuilding their country after World War II.For a character like Koichi, Ryunosuke Kamiki brings an appropriate level of dimension to his performance in the main role. As mentioned earlier, Koichi is not just battling Godzilla, he is also grappling with his own inner turmoil. Often times he is haunted by his past mistakes and the longing to fix them before he completely loses his mind. Kamiki does a great job showing the array of emotions Koichi is going through, ranging from reserved shame for his past actions to intense anger for what Godzilla has done to those he cares about. He holds a personal vendetta against Godzilla, and like Captain Ahab hunting Moby Dick, he becomes obsessed with destroying the giant Kaiju as a way to achieve peace of mind. Watching Koichi develop throughout the story is one of the film's biggest strengths, and it is balanced out near-flawlessly with the usual scenes of Godzilla destroying things.From the viewpoint of a casual fan, \"Godzilla Minus One\" ranks among the most entertaining and emotionally deep monster movies ever made. Having only watched a handful of movies in the series, I have to admit it's quite refreshing to find one this well-made with likeable, interesting human characters in addition to everything else one would expect. To my surprise, this movie was made on a budget of less than $15 million, far lower than most of the Hollywood features rushed out to theatres these days. Western movie studios should take note because this is clearly how action films should be made instead of the same over-produced and over-priced content they continue to churn out every year. After all, if the Japanese can do it, then surely the west can follow suit.I rate it a solid 9/10.",
    "126": "Good? Yes. Great? Possibly, but let's temper expectations. Definitely the better if not the best Godzilla of the 2000's but it's not perfect. I love that Toho has been willing to give filmmakers different takes on Godzilla. My favorite era is Showa Godzilla. However, this isn't the hero or monster fighting monster Godzilla movie. Nor is it a fantasy sci-fi pulp action movie. This is a sober Godzilla, a force of nature Godzilla, which isn't new but is a fantastic flavor to the series and a bit of a crowd pleaser.It's a throwback to the original and it feels fresh. Every Godzilla scene is powerful, exhilarating. But this isn't the agile Godzilla that breaths atomic breath at ease. By comparison, this can be a bit slow and plodding Godzilla, whose atomic breath needs revving up and literally as powerful as atomic bombs. Even that atomic depiction isn't new, GMK and Shin Godzilla use this, but was this was more impactful to me. Less of a personality (but not as odd or bland as Shin Godzilla) and more a force of nature, it's Japan's living nuclear terror.Composer Naoki Sato gives the movie a chilling and fitting atmospheric music. I like that they used one of Godzilla's original themes and roar. But Sato doesn't match original Godzilla composer Akira Ifukube's powerful bombastic themes and originality. Then again, who can match that genius? Sato used a theme from 1962's King King vs. Godzilla, which to me is a bit of an odd choice, making me think of Kong's villagers. But generally, it worked. At times I'd think Ifukube's \"Frigate March\" would be more fitting however.The main character and story are developed well enough. Acting is good (enough) too. The main theme is a post-war survivor's drama. And this makes up a majority of the screen time. The secondary characters are alright but aren't as deep. The way the Japanese fight Godzilla appears to be a bit of an interesting throwback variation too but doesn't dwell on itself meaningfully the way the 1954 movie does. Will it work? \"I don't know, I hope so, let's try it\" is the sentiment.In the end, I felt director/writer Takashi Yamazaki wrote a good drama but a crowd pleaser, thus lacking the sober emotionally sacrificial impact the 1954 version brought. Not to really spoil anything but two characters were given \"cop out\" happy endings and I actually felt a little disappointed by this. Then again, the story wasn't really building to be anything otherwise so maybe I shouldn't be complaining. The only other thing I wished they had hammered in harder is a more explicit or sappier embracing on the \"father-daughter\" relationship of Akiko and Shikishima. Just wasn't enough for me. Frankly, the relationship between Oishi and Shikishma was genuine but also kind of underplayed. Maybe I've seen too many movies and getting too tired of the same thing but the greatest emotional impact was seeing Godzilla's atomic breath. Not Shikishima's emotional story beats.So, Godzilla Minus one is a fresh throwback, a decent drama, and the true Japanese Godzilla as he or it should be depicted. Generally, a well-polished, respectable Godzilla movie in 2023 for the franchise. Good? Yes. Great? Possibly, but definitely memorable.Trivia: This isn't director Takashi Yamazaki's first movie with Godzilla in it. Actually, he gave the King of the Monsters a short cameo at the beginning of the nostalgic series - Always: Sunset on Third Street 2. Another movie I loved more.P.s. I also had to rewrite this damn review over again because my internet failed and my first draft got deleted. :P.",
    "127": "A kamikaze pilot deserts his mission and survives not only the war but an attack by Godzilla. Returning to his post-World War II Japan home, he discovers everything in ruins. He creates a pseudo-family with a woman and child who were also orphaned by the war. They build a home and do their best to make a life for the little girl. The country of Japan and the family are prospering until Godzilla makes his way toward them, destroying everything in his path. The pilot and the citizens decide not to allow the country to be destroyed again and band together to stop Godzilla. The pilot has the opportunity to complete his mission original mission and regain his honor.This is a terrific Godzilla movie with classic and modern features. The story focuses on the people of Japan, their lives after the war, and how it changes their mindset and approach to defending the country from Godzilla. The movie is spoken in Japanese with subtitles and some slow parts, but is satisfying in the end. This movie is excellent for Godzilla fans or anyone looking for something different to watch in theaters.",
    "128": "The Japanese have seemed to learn something about giant monster films (I guess, having essentially perfected the genre in the 20th century) that their American counterparts have not. Yes, the big monster fights, the wanton destruction, and the impossible odds matter. But in reality, what makes a great kaiju film - and this is apparent from the 1954 original Godzilla film - is that the \"monster\" is an allegory. The monster allows you to communicate complex ideas in a digestible way. It's not about bigger monsters or more CG laden fights; it's about theme and messaging.The last two live action Godzilla films I've seen from Japan - Shin Godzilla and Minus One - are less about \"Godzilla\" as much as they are about very human struggles. The former tackles the absurdity of government incompetence and petty politics during a crisis. Minus One, set immediately after the surrender of the Japan after defeat in the Second World War, tackles grief, guilt, and rebuilding, both on an individual and societal level.For much of the film, Minus One feels like a sober period drama, with truly excellent performances from lead Ryonosuke Kamiki (a failed kamikaze pilot turned unsung hero Shikishima) and Minami Hamabe (his kinda/sorta love interest Noriko), who deliver powerful emotion everytime their on screen. But it's the side cast, the men Shikishima meets who bring him back from the brink that really sell this movie for me. For all the darkness and devastation, this is a \"pro-human\" film; whereas Shin Godzilla cast doubt and aspersion about our ability to come together, Minus One proclaims proudly that we can and we do more often than you'd think. I was pleasantly surprised - and very happy - that this film lacked a human villain. Set in the darkly gorgeous ruins of post-war Japan, the cruelty humanity can display (on both sides) was apparent and didn't need to be hammered home.At the end of the day, why do you need a sub villain when GODZILLA is your antagonist? Unlike the American versions that constantly ask us to \"like\" Godzilla to sell toys, the Japanese understand what Godzilla really is: a morally indifferent force of nature that does not care. To say this film's depiction of Godzilla is TERRIFYING would be an understatement. He is immeasurably powerful and destructive, and exerts no effort in levelling an entire district of Tokyo. You really feel like the humans are serious underdogs and can't help but cheer when they prevail, because it's honestly unfair how mismatched they are. I also loved the King of Monster's design; his weird exoskeleton is reminiscent of a sea creature, which was appropriate considering how much of this film (brilliantly) takes place on the high seas. (I think the subtext of Japan, a former naval superpower being on the defensive was fantastic as well)All of this is tied together with a phenomenal score, which goes from triumphant to honestly unsettling at times. The classic Godzilla theme has never sounded so good.Yeah, believe the hype. Minus One rules. I'm happy to see it be so successful in North America, and *hopefully* it can remind Hollywood that the best blockbusters are ones with brains and heart.",
    "129": "The UK release of \"Godzilla Minus One\" is, for some reason, a bit after the US and Japanese releases. I went to a Cineworld Unlimited preview screening last night and really enjoyed it. It's a combination of action and emotion that you rarely see so well balanced.Koichi Shikshima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) returns from World War Two guilt ridden both as he was a Kamikaze pilot that refused the mission and also his inaction during an interaction with Godzilla cost several men their lives. He slowly builds a life with Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and Akiko (Sae Nagatani) their adopted daughter. He works on a minesweeper, but when reports of a much larger Godzilla heading towards Japan come out, they're asked to slow him down.Whereas American studios have generally gone for the spectacle of him, Japanese producers have used Godzilla as a cypher to explore the national reactions. This time it's the loss of the second world war. Koichi is literally told that his cowardice is the reason they lost and why people were killed in bombing raids. The Government later unwilling to participate in any form of military actions, for fear of angering the US and it falls to a \"dads army\" of former soldiers to try and engage him.There's a lot of 'family drama' in the film, but never did I feel that the film dragged in those sections. The performances are really good, particularly from Kamiki, who is in virtually every scene of the film. I also enjoyed the crew on board the Shinsei Maru. The Godzilla scenes themselves though are great, and it's hard not to get a real charge during the Ginza scenes, when the original theme hits. Godzilla in this really is essentially a giant animal, exploring his territory and defending it against intruders, he only resorts to extreme measures, like the fire breath, when attacked.I really enjoyed it and would recommend it and I hope that Takashi Yamazaki gets to make another one. I'll also be looking back into what I can see of his back catalogue.",
    "130": "The giant green one's triumphant return currently in theaters. Shooting back to his origins, nuclear testing which engineered his aberration & focusing on a failed kamikaze pilot, Ryunosuke Kamiki, who lands on a remote island for repairs is soon ensconced by an attack, along w/the stationed mechanics, which decimates their stronghold. Making it back to the mainland, Kamiki finds his hometown destroyed w/only his neighbor still around who takes a stab at him for not sacrificing himself for the cause but things take a turn when rebuilding starts & Kamiki befriends a single mother, Minami Hamabe, & her daughter & they become a defacto family w/Kamiki trying to normalize his life by finding a job on a boat as mine finder where they encounter the giant lizard again who attacks them which they survive but then Godzilla hits their town & in an act of sacrifice Hamabe pushes Kamiki out of the way of an onslaught which fortifies Kamiki's resolve to get behind the pilot seat again for a bombing run on Godzilla (after the town's leaders come up w/a plan to kill Godzilla using the bends & freon in the ocean) as a last ditch effort if all else fails. Partnered w/the equally great Shin Godzilla from a few years ago, this shows how to do a giant monster movie the right way (especially coming out on the heels of the new Godzilla/King Kong trailer which may look entertaining but definitely feels bloated) w/the emphasis on the human factor being paramount but also not forgetting the devastating impact of Godzilla's destruction of cities & infrastructure. Can we also mention the fact this film had a 15 million dollar budget when the American counterparts run easily skyward into the hundreds? Take a page of this book, Hollywood!",
    "131": "There have been many versions of the Godzilla mythology, but, in my opinion, Godzilla Minus One is one of the best I've seen. It's a Japanese-language film, and it's surprisingly explicit in its critique of various aspects of Japan's approach to its past history in wartime. It's commentary on war and nuclear power, symbolised by the post-war emergence of Godzilla, is powerful. And the themes of loss, survival, and hope add emotional depth.The story focuses primarily on Sosaku Tachibana, a fighter pilot, who has managed to avoid his fate as a kamikaze pilot by avoiding action altogether. At one point in the film, it is noticed that his plane hasn't been damaged. The guilt of not fulfilling his orders, including not defending his colleagues against Godzilla early in the story, haunts him, and his internal struggles with this are constantly present as the story unfolds.The other characters are also well-developed and very relatable, bringing a sense of stability in the middle of the chaos. This adds a deeply human element to the story, which focuses more on the humans than the action and special effects, giving us a reason to empathise with and care about these characters rather than just seeking the thrills that come with this genre.Having said that, though, the visual effects in Godzilla Minus One are stunning and bring Godzilla, a very intimidating monster, to life with realism and fine detail. And the action sequences are intense and exciting. Godzilla really feels powerful and destructive as it goes on its rampages.Some viewers may find the plot a bit predictable. But the Godzilla mythology is well-embedded among many filmgoers, so that may increase the sense of predictability. And occasionally, it is obvious that CGI has been used, so there are moments when things seem a bit artificial. And there is not much humour to lighten the relentless sadness and fear of the storyline.If you are a fan of monster movies and action films, and especially of the Godzilla story, go and see Godzilla Minus One. It delivers what it promises when it comes to spectacular visuals and intense action. The explicit exploration of themes of war and loss is handled well.",
    "132": "Man, I've been looking forward to this one! In the wake of a struggling American cinema, Japan graces us with a brand-new kaiju film that shockingly impressed Western audiences left and right. That, folks, is \"Godzilla Minus One\".Plot: A few years after WW2, disgraced kamikaze pilot Shikishima struggles to settle down with his new family and friends. However, a ghost from the past has returned to haunt him as well as the nation, the saurian Godzilla, mutated by nuclear radiation. As the monster vents his rage and plunges Japan in despair, Shikishima and his cohorts face their inner demons and unite to defend their homeland when no one else could.This film is cinematic in every possible way. The story tackles the trauma the Japanese people had to deal with after the war head-on: failures on top of a crippling defeat, personal loss, government failings, and economic decline. Shikishima is a great protagonist, wracked with guilt to the point of reoccurring nightmares yet deep down wants to make amends and help those close to him towards a brighter future, helped by his lovable bunch of companions with their own distinct personalities and insecurities who also served during the war. The drama and interpersonal conflicts are powerful, really making you feel their turmoil, so much so that even when the monster isn't around for a long stretch, they keep you engaged (I actually heard someone in the audience crying from such scenes!). All this serves to emphasize the theme of living and rebuilding after such harrowing times.As for Godzilla, he's presented as an aggressive territorial animal. He feels huge yet personal, his mere presence spine-chilling and power very impactful. This is helped by haunting music (though you still get the classic theme) and equally scary imagery and hard-hitting violence (not overtly bloody, mind you, but enough to leave an impression). There were even moments where it felt like \"Jaws\" in a good way. The times when he uses his atomic breath alone are straight up jaw-dropping. The army's battles with the kaiju are also done well, a good amount of destruction and utter fear, with a climax that's creative in its concept and execution. All this spectacle is done with excellent special effects despite being a fraction of the usual American budget these days; I could practically count every scale on Big G.All in all, \"Godzilla Minus One\" is a must-see that is well-deserved of the large amount of praise it's getting. Not only does it present the monster in a scary light that borders on horror, but it also has human characters that keep your attention, not to mention great music, effects, action, and story. My only slight critique is that the second half does drag a little. I should note that, as of the timing of this review, it's in Japanese with English subtitles, though the actors use a lot of facial expressions to convey the right emotions even when not talking. It gets my recommendation to those who haven't seen it. Long live the King of the Monsters!",
    "133": "The Godzilla Minus One is the best movie from all Godzilla series from any type of monsters movies.What is important to have in movies is characters developing and motivation during from start of movie though end.Even some previous of Godzilla movies did not had good human characters building up and I'm did not get the feeling any of characters until now with Godzilla Minus one is got humanity touch and did amazingly done.Yamazaki's work as director and also as screenwriter did marvelous work. With drama, tension and sadness and destruction.Differently watch this movie on cinema! I highly recommended.",
    "134": "Godzilla Minus One doesn't even need Godzilla to succeed. Takashi Yamazaki's film is set in post World War II Japan, following a failed kamikaze pilot haunted by trauma and guilt, which manifests in the form of a destructive behemoth from the sea. The film stars Minami Hamabe and Kamiki Ryunosuke.The film is at its peak when it's a character study of a devastated Japan. Outside of the action scenes with Godzilla, the other half of the film is balanced well with compelling characters. Even with English subtitles, American audiences feel the emotional weight and turmoil of the actors' performances as their characters navigate the reconstruction of their lives. While I expected an epic action film, I was completely surprised by a poignant character-driven story. Showing the many conflicting viewpoints of the Japanese people through its characters, the film ultimately argues against the senseless loss of human life that was seen during WWII.Godzilla can be perceived as a symbol of death and destruction as the film brings the iconic reptilian monster back to its roots, unlike many of the recent American Godzilla films. Presented as a force of nature, Godzilla shows no remorse as it crushes people and buildings. Right as the struggles that the characters face seem to be coming to a resolution, Godzilla steps in with its atomic breath, a clear allegory for the atomic bomb and its destructive power. Since strong characters are established, the audience actually feels sadness when Godzilla mows through civilization.While the film had a tiny budget of 15 million dollars (compare that to Godzilla vs. Kong's nearly 200 million dollar budget), the visual effects were still effective. Though there were a few shaky shots, Godzilla's monstrous size came across nicely, creating thrilling action scenes. These action scenes were elevated further by the sturdy emotional core of the film.It should be noted that the film's back half wasn't nearly as compelling as its first half. The first hour of the film had a well balanced mix of action and drama. Unfortunately, the action takes a backseat during the last hour and the drama doesn't pack as much of a punch. The film also doesn't fully commit to some of its plot points, lessening the impact of some heartbreaking character moments. But, the film does eventually reach an explosively satisfying conclusion.Oddly, some may take issue with the film's inclusion of Godzilla. The character study aspect does stand on its own two feet and could've been made even better if it were solely focused on. Then again, a story about a pilot overcoming his guilt and creating a family wouldn't bring as big of an audience to theaters. In my opinion, Godzilla isn't totally unnecessary as its presence reinforces the film's messaging and metaphors.Godzilla Minus One not only succeeds at reinvigorating the terror in Godzilla but it also serves as a gripping presentation of a country pulling together to rebuild a past life. The synthesis of heart and action creates one of, if not the best, monster-centered action films.",
    "135": "The BankofMarquis just viewed one of the most entertaining films of 2023 - and it's a GODZILLA film.Yes, a GODZILLA film.From famed Japanese Studio Toho, makers of the original Godzilla film from the 1950's plus other \"man in a rubber suit\" monster movies like MOTHRA and WAR OF THE GARGANTUANS, Godzilla Minus One subverts the genre for a moment for instead of presenting a \"Monster stomping on buildings\" movie with some people in the background, this film is about the Japanese people and how they deal with the aftermath of World War II while (also) running from a giant monster stomping on buildings - but the monster story is the \"B\" story and the people story is the \"A\" story...and this subversion of the genre works very very well.The title of the film, Godzilla Minus One, refers to the fact that...after World War II.... Japan was \"starting from zero\". When Godzilla starts attacking, it knocks Japan back another peg, hence...Godzilla Minus One.Director and Screenwriter Takashi Yamazaki tells the tale of Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki) who encounters Godzilla towards the end of WWII and freezes, causing the death of his fellow soldiers (so his PTSD continues to tell him throughout the film). Once back in Japan, he encounters a young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe) who has been left orphaned, homeless and alone and is sheparding an abandoned baby. This unlikely trio form a bond...and a home...while trying to rebuild their lives and (in Koichi's case) tries to make sense of the devastation he encountered in the war.Into to this rebuilding stomps Godzilla.This story is effectively told by Yamazaki, who knows when to focus on the people aspect of the film and when to focus on the building stomping of Godzilla. It's a delicate balance that is helped by the performances of Kamiki and Hamabe...and the special effects that brings the spirit of the 1950's and 1960's Toho monster films to light.A surpwisingly rich entertainment, Godzilla Minus One will entertain you with monster stomping...and deep human emotion.Letter Grade: A- (I'm as surprised as you are)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",
    "136": "Godzilla Minus One is virtually perfect, just as good as everyone is saying it is.Minus One is essentially a remake of the original Godzilla. Even the science fantasy plan to destroy the monster is a variation on the plan from the original, albeit somewhat less silly. Also like the original, a thematic focus of Minus One is the collective trauma which immediately follows a catastrophe. Interestingly, rather than staging the atomic bombs as the backdrop of that trauma, as in the original Godzilla, the trauma here, and in fact the physical setting in the first part of the movie, is Tokyo after the notorious fire bombing by the United States.Into the collective and immediate trauma, Minus One folds the post-traumatic trauma of its main protagonist, while also playing on the theme of redemption. The motivation behind this character's trauma is the conflict between that expectation of fulfilling one's duty that is so particular to Japanese culture, particularly WWII military culture, and specifically the duty to die expected of kamikaze pilots.If all of that seems rather intense for a \"mere\" monster movie, well, there is nothing \"mere\" about this flick. All of that depth is perfectly delivered through excellent acting from top to bottom (I teared up twice during this movie, something I have never done watching a kaiju), genuine character development, even among secondary characters, and impeccable direction. The choice of camera distance from characters, camera placement and angles, and the judicious use of slow motion, all contribute to that depth, too. Regarding slow motion: I generally hate it because it is so rarely used effectively and so often used in a cheesy, eye rolling way. As much as I love the Lord of the Rings trilogy, there are only one or two moments across all 11 and 1/2 hours that were made more effective through slow motion. The rest of those slow mo moments are the weakest shots in the entire trilogy. The exact opposite is the case here. Somehow, director Takashi Yamazaki uses slow motion several times with each moment being effective and affecting. One particularly brilliant use of slow motion combines it with screen silence. Yamazaki pulls out all the stops.The score is equally compelling. During some sequences, it's almost creepy, certainly atmospheric in a very non-action movie kind of way. It lends those moments a gravitas completely lacking in the blaring, heavy-handed scores of every American Godzilla movie. Composer Naoki Sato even works in Akira Ifukube's famous, doomy leitmotif, but does so sparingly. His score is as impeccable as Yamazaki's directing.Finally, the special effects. Unlike the cartoonish, glowy, neon CG of the American Godzilla movies of the last 10 years or so, Minus One's monster is naturalistic. It looks like an animal be it a horrifying, almost supernatural one. Similarly, the buildings and their destruction is less spectacle and more catastrophic devastation, more appropriately reflecting the damage done by the fire bombing and the atomic bombs.I don't often write such long reviews, but this movie knocked my socks off. I will buy it when it's available on disc, also not something I often do with newer movies.",
    "137": "Ok, I'm going to start off by saying, I'm not a big fan of the Godzilla lore. I have not seen a lot of the Godzilla movies. I've seen a few before, but nothing that really stuck out to me. Decided to see this in the theater today, because I have heard a lot of good reviews on it from different people. This movie is really really good. The people behind making this Godzilla movie looks like they put lot of heart and love and work and passion to getting this made, taking things back to basics maybe. The human characters, wow, just wow. You know, in alot of these types of films, the monster doing the smashing is the main setup, and a lot of times, the human characters are not even that interesting at all. But in Godzilla Minus One, the human characters , the main character, Koichi Shikishima, is a very compelling interesting character dealing with past trauma, guilt, and a desire to escape his mistakes. The other main characters are also very interesting, and you feel that you care about what happens to them. From the the start of the movie to the very end, I was totally invested, cared about the other characters stories , and wondering how they were going to survive. Godzilla's design I really liked here quite a bit. Godzilla in this is a total force of nature, a primal ,killing, wrecking machine. Very very curious to see if this filmmaker will continue with another Godzilla movie, if he does, I'm definitely watching that too.",
    "138": "They revisited the first film for Godzilla and put an interesting story line behind it. The viewer becomes attached to the human characters in the film and Godzilla, while Godzilla himself is reduced to the level of pure jerk. Godzilla in other films fought and defeated other monsters, as a kind of hero, but that's not the case here. This version is simply bare bones survival for the humans. The special effects are some of the best I've seen in films. The depiction of post war Tokyo was awesome. Right down to the details of what transit trains looked like and how they were built in that era. A lot of research went into this film to make the audience accept the back ground as realistic. One of the hero's of the film was a fighter plane called the Shinden (Superfortress Interceptor), which really did exist as a secret weapon against the U. S. As a kid, I built a model of this plane, so I knew what it could do. The only let down was the dismissal of American forces during this time period. The excuse used was that American involvement could trigger a conflict with the Soviets, which I don't believe. If you've never seen a Godzilla film, this one is worth the time.",
    "139": "I never thought in my life I'd see a Godzilla movie that would make me emotional, and yet here it is. This movie is incredibly well written. It has no business being this good, but I'm glad it is. TOHO knocked it out of the park, as did the director, cinematographer, set designer, actors, writers, effects artists, they should all be proud of the work they did here. No line of dialogue, nor scene, nor action happens without good reason and callback. I have only a few minor complaints that don't really add up to much but here they are. For one, CG is not scary or realistic looking. It's all very well done, but it still looks like CG, that's just how it is and always will be. The actors still did a great job reacting to it, so it's passable enough. For two, there were only a couple of moments that seemed out of place for the characters, yet they dissipated over time and were forgotten easily enough, as they blended into the overall story. In the end, I loved this movie and hope the follow-up will be just as good. Some may complain that there wasn't enough Godzilla. I'll admit Godzilla seemed more like a background character that showed up a couple of times, but it was acceptable enough for the type of movie this became. The messaging of survival, family, sacrifice, forgiveness, were all felt and admirable. I teared up more times than I'd like to admit. Amazing job TOHO team!!!",
    "140": "I don't think I've ever rated a movie as a 10 before and this is because I think a 10 is given out so easily but to me it means perfection, something to be strived for but never achieved. Well this film has broken my thoughts on perfection, I'd give this movie a 20 if I could, a couple of times the effects are a little bit janky but for the budget they are out of this world. The human story element gives a splendid balance to the shear awesomeness of Godzilla and I was going through the roller coaster of emotions of grinning like a child to shedding a tear or two on more than one occasion. The characters are so believable and flawed that you can help but cheer them on the whole story. Great set pieces with the Godzilla making a mess of the town, island or wherever he decides to land upon. I'll be looking up the director and keeping an eye out for more films because this. I don't think this will be a film to rewatch many times like some of my favourites which I usually attribute some of my scoring to, but for tonight - watching this was truly an epic film that I don't think I will ever quite match. If you can watch in a cinema, the booms and other sound effects have some very decent bass to them and really adds to the spectacle.",
    "141": "There is hope for old franchises yet! Go see this on a big screen while you can because Godzilla: Minus One is cinema at its finest! It's the most thrilling movie I've seen in a very long time. I will admit that I went into the theater ready for the same safe, by the numbers outing that I've come to expect over the franchise's very long lifespan. It's probably what most of us would expect from any old IP at this point: Appeal to the masses, don't take too many risks and hopefully make as much money as possible. But how surprised I am!I'm so happy to say that Godzilla: Minus One is a revelation! An unconventional and fresh interpretation that builds on the strengths of its predecessors and elevates the property to uncharted new heights. This is the most well developed and terrifying iteration of Godzilla yet. The movie really capitalizes on the potential of its simple premise; what would humanity do if an unkillable and unrelenting monster appeared and started laying waste to our home?This is what happens when you hand the reins of a beloved franchise over to the right people and really focus on the story/concept. Godzilla: Minus One does not play it safe. It does not hold back. It is an intense, brutal film about a horrible monster that showcases humanity at its best while at its most dire. It deftly delivers in a way that keeps it grounded and very believable. Much care went into all facets of this well crafted story. From Godzilla's design, the striking cinematography, immersive sound design, shocking visual effects to the truly haunting reimagining of the original score. This familiar franchise manages to feel new and original in the best way possible.Godzilla is an absolute menace this time around. He is more violent than ever and we get an up close and personal view of every brutal kill, which is a new and exciting direction for the franchise. His new look is the most realistic and frightening yet. He has some really fresh and straight up shocking design elements that you'll have to see the movie to appreciate. He is jaw-droppingly powerful and quite unnerving. I was surprised at how he is unabashedly portrayed as a ruthless and even sadistic destroyer. They were not afraid to make Godzilla an absolutely unredeemable force of evil. Nothing is safe from him and you feel that sense of hopelessness and dread for our human characters. Personally, I was left with the impression that Godzilla took pleasure in deliberately inflicting as much pain and suffering as possible on an individual and personal level and I was actually disturbed. It was scary to witness! This Godzilla is going to give you nightmares.The most surprising part of this story is something that most of the genre has struggled with: delivering a human element that is interesting and that you can care for. I was moved to tears by unexpected and beautiful scenes of pure humanity that are borne by acts of cruelty and war. There is an incredible emphasis on and respect for the enduring human spirit in the face of insurmountable odds and suffering. It really gave credence to the untold suffering the Japanese people endured during and after WW2 without being heavy handed. This added a level of emotional depth that gripped me from start to finish. I couldn't help but care for our human protagonists and really hope they would somehow survive the beast's wrath.Godzilla: Minus One is an absolute must watch for all moviegoers and it really deserves to transcend the monster movie genre. I believe this marks an exciting time for the film industry and I hope other IPs will start to be helmed by people who actually care about telling great stories.-crisPkhrust.",
    "142": "Godzilla Minus One- The best Godzilla movie to be made so far with a budget of less than $15M.Watching it in 4D amplified the breathtaking experience of the larger than life monster with crazy special effects, seats under motion along with gush of air/water.Highlight is the story telling with the real struggle at Japan post World War Two.The characterization is close to the heart and feels real.Don't miss this gem on the larger screen, especially in 4D. Only caveat is that it's in Japanese language (subtitles is the way to go).Go with kids as they can experience the sheer power of Godzilla and the menace it creates!",
    "143": "Nothing will prepare you for how spectacularly awesome this version of Godzilla is. Dare I say it even bests the original 1954 version, which I thought could never be done. Forget all those regrettable storylines of hollow earth or Godzilla as the great protector of Mother Earth. Godzilla Minus One is less a movie about giant Kaiju wreaking havoc on civilization- although we do get that, too- and more a serious (deadly serious) tale of the human toll of war. Unlike previous Godzilla films, there isn't the direct link between the birth of the atomic age and the birth of Godzilla. Instead, Minus One very effectively takes a more human approach.Ryunosuke Kamiki' Koichi is the lens we are forced to see the horrors of the aftermath of the war. Returning to his village to far less than a hero's welcome, Koichi is faced with trying to rebuild his life after loss of his parents. Soon, his burden is set upon by the arrival of Hamabe Minami' Noriko and the baby she has been left to care for. This is a bleak film. And, Koichi and Noriko painstakingly try to eke out an existence among the rubble. The performances of Kamiki and Minami are near Oscar worthy. But, in all honesty, there isn't a single bad performance in this film.There is not a lot of Godzilla in this film. American audiences will probably expect more giant lizard for their ticket price, but in this case the film is better for it. When we do see Godzilla, he is all menace. He is hell bent on destruction, and ravages the city reminiscent of the first film. However, because this takes place in a post war landscape, the devastation carries more weight. The emotional tug is something unlike any previous Godzilla movie.There really isn't much not to love about this movie. The cinematography is excellent. The performances are exceptional. The effects make most Hollywood big-budget films of recent memory seem laughable. And, there is enough classic Godzilla moments to remind you why you bought a ticket in the first place.Bravo Toho Studios and Takashi Yamazaki! Bravo!",
    "144": "Highly recommended for anyone jaded with over use of CG effects, or tired of catching up on hours of TV / movie series in order to fully enjoy a fully paid yet incomplete film.The film smartly introduces characters and plots with minimalist dialogues so non-Japanese speaking audiences can focus on the story instead of busy reading subtitles. The cast of familiar seasoned actors expressed themselves with universal body language such as embraces and tears so the language barrier is not a concern at all.This movie serves up a touching story of personal tragedy, post-war grief, and the strength of friendship, familial bond, and courage in face of rising cold war tensions and unprecedented crisis from a terrifying creature.Obviously one can read into the heatwave blast from Godzilla and its territorial attacks (it tries to move into Tokyo Bay and shop in Ginza district, fancy!) as a symbolic cautionary tale of weapons of mass destruction, wrath of nature, etc. Thankfully the action scenes delivered tension without overstaying its welcome nor being preachy. 2 hours is just right amount of time to build characters, relationships, suspense and tension.One critical message in the story was the redemptive power of forgiveness, hope and communal solidarity to protect the future. A few remarks were made about how the government treated its soldiers' lives too cheaply, with poor equipment and supplies; and how information about Godzilla's imminent attack on Tokyo was suppressed to avoid chaos (uh, that reminds me of the mayor unwilling to warn the beach goers about the great white). The writers try to acknowledge the dire poverty and a sense of abandonment in postwar Japan without being cynical. The story is made to be uplifting and hopeful. The success of this movie is telling studio executives that audiences want movies with a heart. If the film happens to be in a theatre near you, enjoy!",
    "145": "How many monster movies come with substantial critical claim attached? I was intrigued, even though I've never seen any of the classic Godzilla films. You won't regret seeing the film, but I didn't walk away feeling like I'd just watched the film of the year either.Godzilla Minus One follows the story of a kamikaze pilot who aborts his mission and lands on a small supply island. Later, Godzilla emerges and wipes out nearly everyone. Haunted by his actions, both in failing to carry out his mission and failing to act in saving the others on the island, the pilot returns to Tokyo and attempts to rebuild his life. Before long though, Godzilla reemerges and he feels compelled to join the defense of Tokyo.It's a good story, and there's an endearing human element to it all. The movie's not short of political commentary either, whether in subtext or unambiguous comments from the characters, ranging from views of honor and duty, criticism of the government, or even Japan's diminished autonomy in light of defeat in WWII. Notice that no government really does anything in the movie. The U. S. is sidelined because of concerns over raising tensions with the Soviets; the Japanese government is unable to act. Instead, it's the people themselves who have to act and save themselves.Towards the end, the film veers harder and harder towards melodrama, which detracted from the nice balance of seriousness and humor that had been present throughout the first several acts. Maybe it's a terrific Godzilla film; I can't speak to that. (This reminds me of the 007 films. There are \"good\" Bond films that still aren't good movies.) I can say that this Godzilla is a good movie and worth your time.",
    "146": "It's Godzilla 1947 Japan, a period piece with AAA period detail thruout. It's also Godzilla-noir; The main character struggles over and over with survivor guilt from WWII. It's nothing like the more up-beat, Westernized Legendary Godzilla with the Monarch over-story. Where the Monarch Godzilla is more dramatic and imaginative, Godzilla 1947 is more about honoring Godzilla as an artistic Japanese creation. At the end, after Godzilla's takedown, all the sailors salute Godzilla.It's great filmmaking; the script took three years to write. The inevitable Godzilla takedown is a collaborative effort of de-commissioned Japanese naval sailors, a voluntary group of citizens working against impossible odds. (An even greater, positive, collaborative group effort can be seen in the great Chinese film, The Wandering Earth (Netflix). The script took three years to write. It's basically a non-ironic re-make of Godzilla (1954) re-imagined with better plot, better human characters and better VFX.It's too long (124 mins). Cutting 20-25 minutes would have helped it do better at the box office. It's also a Toho filmWashington Post: \"Top Gun Maverick and this Godzilla show us there's an audience for movies which combine concise and creative action with emotionally resonant human characters.\" Yes as in the best of the Legendary Monarch Godzillas, the balance also works here.Film Stage: \"It's willing to stay in the quiet anguish of several characters for uncomfortable lengths of time so the ultimate release is all the sweeter.\"Empire: \"A refreshingly humanist and nostalgic reboot of the iconic monster franchise, Takashi Yamazaki's Godzilla Minus One takes the atomic lizard back to his post-war roots, while making the most of the director's background in animation and VFX direction through convincing, tactile and classic design work.\"",
    "147": "Wow, this movie was amazing, the character arcs were fabulous, and it felt like a real story with real people and things that actually mattered! I have only praise for this movie! It was not like your traditional Hollywood blockbuster, and even though it was made by quite a small/ unknown team, the effects were 1000 times better than anything Hollywood has put out in the last 30 years.Now nothing can be perfect, so here are some minor criticisms:the story arc, especially towards the end for quite predictable, and I was able to guess everything that happened (maybe the fact that I can read German helped on one thing but I won't spoil)it seemed too short for such an in-depth story, and I feel like some parts were skipped. They could have totally made this two movies.But still I highly recommend you see it!",
    "148": "For perhaps the first time in his 70 year career, Godzilla is terrifying. Not only is this the best of the Godzilla series, nothing in the Jurassic films comes close to the terror, suspense, intelligence, and drama of GODZILLA MINUS ONE. The performance of Ryunoskuke Kamiki anchors the film and carries the audience on a rewarding emotional journey. Naoki Sato's score is particularly effective. Rarely does cinema get better than this.Feeling as if he unfairly cheated death too many times, Shikishima, a surviving Kamikaze pilot is attacked on Odo Island along with many war plane engineers by a gargantuan monster. After the engineers die due to Shikishima failing to distract the monster, an overwhelming amount of guilt weighs on him, especially after a homeless woman and a baby move into his home when he returns. Shikishima, now on a personal mission, teams up with a large group of veterans to finally take down the monster known as Godzilla.",
    "149": "I went into the movie with high expectations because of the premise and the writer/director Takashi Yamazaki who is one of the best filmmakers working in Japan right now and he definitely blew me away with this movie. Everything about Godzilla Minus One is brilliant from start to finish. The story was so well written and compelling that I could feel the emotions and tension most of the characters were feeling when dealing with the horrifying situation. The human story of the movie might be the best in the Godzilla franchise. And it definitely helps when the performances are amazing. Ryunosuke Kamiki's performance was so good especially when you are seeing his character grow in a very emotional manner. And I love his chemistry with Minami Hamabe who is equally good. And it should without saying that Yamazaki's direction is phenomenal! I love the way he shows Godzilla's size, power, and absolute brutality in all different aspects of the scene. Seriously, almost every shot of Godzilla looks like an awesome painting or poster. Speaking of the king of the monsters, his presence was definitely menacing in this film. This version of Godzilla is just pure rage and will wipe every human off the face of Japan. The design of Godzilla was simple but unique in a well balanced way and the visual effects look great! I highly recommend seeing it in the biggest theater possible! I got to see the movie in IMAX and it was a breath taking experience!"
