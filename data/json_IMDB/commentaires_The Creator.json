    "0": "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.",
    "1": "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.",
    "2": "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping on the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.",
    "3": "With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.",
    "4": "AI is such a rich topic, it can be explored from any kind of angles but this movie decided to use it only as a prop. The AI people are just stand-ins for oppressed people X. None of the AI people are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!), which is one of many advantages machines would have over humans. The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and in a better way.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Awkward change of tones, a weird plot structure with constant flashbacks, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas at play. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the 135min runtime, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to another.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country where the story takes place doesn't have military or a defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers will only be used for a door. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. The last action set piece in particular is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices. Next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. Mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, those have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their task of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing interesting. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. And I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only aesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.",
    "5": "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.",
    "6": "As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped.",
    "7": "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.",
    "8": "So i like the ground premise. AI doesn't need to be evil.And i like the visuals, the rest is bad to worse.What is new Asia? In the beginning you get the impression that it is only a bunch of beach villages, but that doesn't hold when you get to the city.So if it is more in the line of amerika vs asia, do we really should belive that a) Amerika can basically freely send troops to asia?B) That asia doens't have the means to destroy one (not defendet) orbital platform? I mean it couldn't even repell one unarmed spaceship that was know to harbor \"the antichrist\".And i never gets better. So there are tanks as big as a football stadium, on the american side. They attack on of the asia outposts, and only a single on of the defenders gets the idea to use a anti panzer mine? When only one of them is evidently enough to immobilize such a tank? Really?And than there is the stormtropper level aim of the robots.I mean there is a police force of robots, which are cleary designed for conflict. They definetly don't have a problem to hurt people, or they wouldn't have throw a grenade as a greeting into the barn, where they suppected the two americans. So they have AI, Robot bodies, and still can't hit any target? Again really?There even is scene where the MC is in a room with ~8 Robots, guns pointed at him, an he easily destroys them all, because they can't hit him. Is this another John Wick movie?How do the powers of our girl McGuffin work? Just AI is nowhere near of an adequate explanation.And the list of inconsitencies, plotholes, and stuff that is just never explained, or strait up illogical goes on.If you go into this movie excepting popcorn kino, you might be entertained (even though annoyed by the last third), but any more and you will be utterly disappointed.",
    "9": "I had really high hopes when I walked into the theater; midway through the show I was struggling to keep myself awake. The only surprising part of the show, (SPOILER) seeing that it's a Hollywood movie, was that the bad guys were the American military and the good guys were the (unspecified, but strongly hinted to be China) East Asian robots and people (although a bunch of them had Indian faces and spoke Hindi) and that one American person.So, what's good about the movie? Ummm... some CGI images. Maybe.What's bad? Let's start with the storyline. Entirely predictable. Even the twist, about who the creator is, can be seen coming from a mile away. I could not feel - and I tried, really - any emotional attachment with any of the characters. I just couldn't care less if they lived or died. And the robots! The only way I could tell they were robots was because they had a hole in their head! Everything else was entirely human. Same bad aim when shooting, same human emotions, same habits of eating and drinking as human soldier buddies.And don't even talk about the AI. First of all, it should be AGI, not an AI. Second, the whole deal with AGI is that they have all the world's knowledge at their fingertips and can analyze and synthesize info at lightening speed, giving them the ability to come up with better solutions to problems. This AI, however, is even worse than ChatGPT. There's actually no AI at all anywhere to be seen in the movie. The only thing that the supposedly super-AI child can do is fold his hands in a namaste like form and turn power on and off. Remotely. Without accessing any power grid or electronic system. It's like magic!The dialogues, what of it there is, is very rudimentary. \"What would you like, AI child?\" \"FREEDOM FOR ALL!\" \"Oh, we don't have that in the fridge. Would icecream do for you?\" Enthusiastic nodding by the child, \"yes!\" Me, slapping my hands on my forehead, \"Gack!\"And, finally, how is it that that humongous low altitude American space ship is allowed to hang over the East Asian country (China? Singapore? Indonesia?) for years with no one having tried to shoot it down?Tl;dr worst 20 bucks spent on a movie ticket in recent memory.",
    "10": "We went to see this in IMAX and really wanted to enjoy it but it felt flat for us. The story is bad. The dialogues are bad. People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.",
    "11": "It's worse than other similar movies, most notably terminator, blade runner and i robot. I expected this film to be better. But it's very empty lackluster movie. It turned into cliched drama. Main guy is a hero who is originally from bad side but betrays to good side. He saves the world and sacrifices himself. Sounds too familiar? That's like Avatar, battle for terra, dancing with the wolves, pocahontas, elysium, district 9, whatever.One of the good things in this movie is that story is different than typical human vs robots movies. It's not robots trying to exterminate humans, but it's the other way around. Robots have apparently feelings and emotions. And robots eat and drink too. I don't really know how is this possible, and how these androids work.I like the way they portrayed americans as the genocidal, warmongering, war criminal bad guys. That's not something you see often in american movies. I wonder how did the US government approve this movie. Or maybe they don't care at all?There are many inconsistencies in this movie, mostly technological. People have super advanced stuffs yet still living in poor condition. These asian farmers look like any farmer from 3rd world country in real life. The guns they use are just AK47 with ridiculously long barrel. The US army super heavy vehicle is too large and clumsy. And one c4 just disables it, what a joke lol.Was it really necessary to build a trillion dollar space station only to launch missiles? That's something you can already do with current technology. Missiles can be fired from land silos, mobile trucks, submarines and ships. It makes no sense.And why don't these asians have any air defense and anti armor weapon? If it was the New Asia officially at war with the US, they would have used long range SAM or air launched missile against NOMAD. Looks like USA is fighting to bunch of farmers and militias. These guys are like taliban with robots. Maybe that's the only explanation.",
    "12": "I truly wanted to love this film with all my heart but halfway through I kept feeling more and more detached as the seconds and minutes rolled by. It's the kind of movie that you appreciate but emotionally cannot connect with. I blame the leads.Denzel's son is so bland and dull, he has no chemistry or charisma with any of the actors. He should have played a robot.The little girl actress was absolutely terrible and annoyingly drab. These two characters were supposed to melt away at my heart but they never did. Cinematically it's a nice movie to look at but perhaps one of the most uninteresting and boring films of the year.If you have chronic Insomnia I suggest you go to the late showing of this, you'll be snoozing in no time.",
    "13": "Plot was very icky and predictable .. hovered between marvel and a sci-fi b movie .. the child and Namata characters were excellent .. the lead male, general and woman commander was wooden and unconvincing.. in fact annoying... alwsys good to see a movie take down the Yankee hegemony.., reflects what is the reality in the world ... the portrayal of AI was captivating and the music soundtrack cool .. the imagery and construction of scenes and various weapons and craft was good .. though very much like a Star Wars type off shoot ... all in all an average movie with some good moments but way to long at over 2 hours.",
    "14": "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.",
    "15": "Coming from tenet you could see how low this movie actually is now don't get me wrong is not like am comparing but honestly it's like killing the fire with water I just don't see any resemblance in any form of the movie but that it related to any event that could take place a crying child which is annoying to begin with and what with struggling of destructing the one thing the humans in the movie created, it's no base no lever no structure and on top of that nothing in completion the movie in my eyes flopped way to kill a the creator. I know am not the only one but hey some others like me who've seen so many movies gets it.",
    "16": "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\nThe movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.",
    "17": "This is one of these movies that I could seriously have avoided if only I knew how bad it is.There are so many problems with it.Maya again: that poor actress is always called Mia on every movies she makes about AI?The wig Allison Janney wears is unconvincing, is too short and at times her sweaty make up is not great.This is a movie where AI is taking over humans, but yet in a Tibetan convent to alert other AI they use a church bell: really!! Computers alerted by a church bell?Lots of dying AI computer machines. Lots of killing in this movie but there isn't much blood involved, so it is safe to watch!Also, in the middle of the movie - after killing hundreds of humans and hundreds of AI computers - one character suggested not to go because is dangerous, at that point dangerous is just a superfluous word: who writes these scripts?The whole movie is just to get to the end to see an impossible spaceship being destroyed by a human and not by AI.The whole idea, script and timing is so unconvincing.This movie plot is for students needing time to kill and for no-one-else.",
    "18": "The Creator takes us on a trip of a lot of tiresome genre cliches (of that kind of dystopian movies). Nothing we get served is new, nothing makes too much sense (plot holes galore), but we get some action, but even that is at best mediocre executed. Really, with that budget but with real settings they would have made a masterclass sci-fi movie two decades ago, or at least a supreme bong of cheese. Now, they spend the money more or less on special-effects and some bum bum. And that's it. Anyway, people who love movies like District 9, Elysium or Chappy, may find The Creator still somewhat likeable, but I didn't like the trip much: no well crafted story, no suspense or excitement, no visionary world-building nor too great acting.",
    "19": "I was actually rooting for the \"bad guys\" - the US Army. From the beginning it is built on plot holes that are never answered and we are supposed to go along with unnamed assumptions such as robots having emotions but sometimes not, robots being harmful but sometimes not, or the main character having some unsaid need to betray his country because of a robotic kid that has powers that make appearances whenever convenient.It could've been a masterpiece. It was a beautiful watch. The integration of vfx is masterclass. I was so tempted to leave early but the cinematography kept me in it. Which is why it is so so disappointing to have this flop. Mr Washington, please get yourself a new agent. You're so talented, but this was not the movie for you.",
    "20": "Just felt too much of a compound rehash of stuff we've already seen. The AI army may as well have been a regular army and for the most part the plot would have functioned exactly the same. How are the ai bases so easily infiltrated also? Like the space station and the temple where Maia was being kept. Some compelling performances I must admit, but needed more from the dialogue. The visuals were awesome and I did love the aesthetic. I respect the boldness in going for a new original sci fi and I'm sick to death of reboots of Star Wars. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out that there were exec wars in the creation of this and Edwards was stubborn about maintaining his vision even though it in parts became redundant. One example of this is the chapters which didn't seem to work. Bit of a mess overall. Could do with more new sci fi though.",

Nope. Not so much plot holes as an abyss where a plot might go. Nothing made sense.

There's no magic in this movie. It's just another product of Hollywood's dark age. This is Hollywood's dark age. This movie epitomises it. It is an artless, soulless age, and this is an artless, soulless movie not worthy of my time.This movie is yet more disappointment.

The plot is great and about a war with humans and A. I. and the answer to ending the war is a child robot.It has a great world building. Exciting action set pieces with great visual effects. The cast ensemble is great. Hans Zimmer music score is also good. The film takes big risks. Its not a franchise or based on a superhero franchise. Being an original story. And it delivers. The film delivers its epic scope which needs to be seen on the big screen. Overall, it is one amazing ride that takes you on a sci fi journey.",
    "26": "He is primarily why the movie fails big time. Unlike his father he has zero charisma. He literally brings down any movie he's in ( with the exception of Black Klansman ). Tenet was just as awful, mostly because of his unremarkable acting. He's the reason I didn't see it in a theatre and I'm so thankful I didn't because I would have walked out. The movie has a lot of action and tons of explosions; all amounting to much ado about nothing. Visuals are the only nice thing but with no emotional investment whatsoever they're also meaningless. There is absolutely no character to care about though Watanabe tries. I was also surprised that Hans Zimmer did the score which was more like background noise rather than his usual score which elevates a film. It's evident why this movie fails if you have taste. This movie was utterly unwatchable. What a waste.",

Just mindless amalgamation of scenes that were supposed to engineer some kind of reaction. The only reaction the entire theater had was sighing, cringing, and leaving.I want my time back. God.There was no basis for anything that was happening, the tech made no sense, the story even less. And God, some people think that expecting all movies to have substance beyond moving images is snobbish - wait until you see a movie that somehow has NONE. God that was insane. How do you fumble having this budget.I want my time back. I want to wash my brain under cold water and forget.",

If you think about the meaning of what is happening even for a second, the way it is shown here makes you want to puke. Not only did they attribute human qualities to robots, as in the stupidest cliché, they made them look like people visually and showed that they \"live\" just like people. Literally take AI out of the movie, replace it with, say, \"another race\" and absolutely nothing will change. What can we talk about if the super advanced weapon here that looks like a child controls other mechanisms (many of which are not connected to the network, which makes it even more ridiculous) by moving their hands??? I can say with complete confidence that the creators of this film know nothing about AI, absolutely nothing, and everything they know about robots is taken from science fiction of the 50s. It's also worth mentioning the inadequate stupidity of the acting heroes. Plot is lame and empty, main hero is a brick, it was really hard to watch to the end.

No spontaneity, nothing out of character, nothing to draw the audiences attention from the relentless progression of the plot. No chaos or randomness allowed.*Must have a happy endingAwful, awful, awful. It left me with so many questions, because it simply wasn't interested in explaining anything in any depth whatsoever.

Its neither cyberpunk, nor good sci-fi, the sci-fi themes are all but surface level premise and are not explored whatsoever. Might as well be magic.

By the 45 minute mark I needed to leave the theater and did just that.The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because the visuals were pretty cool, especially the USS Nomad which is a huge flying military base meant to hunt down hostile AI.There was potential for this movie to be pretty good but the writing and acting sabotaged it.",

The whole movie could have definitely benefited from finer writing and acting to bring the emotional depth it sorely needed for the story they tried to tell. And there are also many plot holes and elements that just plainly don't make sense.

    "39": "This is a mix tape of movies you've seen before (if you watch movies). \"Blade Runner\" \"Elysium\" \"The Golden Child\" and so forth. It's frustrating to watch as this mash up of better movies lacks a lot of focus.The story is of a battle between artificial intelligence that are blamed when they run amok and injure humanity. In the wake, Joshua (John David Washington) finds love in a replicant...oh wait...a supposed link to a higher being that could end the war. Much like \"Avatar\" the military gets involved in \"policing\" a section of the world that still doesn't consider A. I. that horrible. Namely \"New Asia\" This place is very much like Thailand. A tropical paradise that harbors these synthetics.What the movie never tackles is what it means to be artificial intelligence. I know, it's a big ask, since again, better movies have addressed it. BUT, a breadcrumb of their existence may give us a better idea of what to feel. Because director Gareth Edwards choses to just show small moments of gentleness in the A. I. population doesn't necessarily convince me they are altruistic. Maybe we only made Tibetian monk models.Meanwhile, humans are brutish ugly warmongers (again, we've seen this SOOOOOOO many times)This tiresome flick gets muddled in the battle aspects. In terms of the \"weapon\" not being a weapon but the savior of humanity (roll eyes). We see where this goes.Yes, the visuals are impressive. But they amount to so little emotional core that you wish it were a better movie.I sensed the ending was tacked on. There is a heartwrenching moment (I guess) where Joshua needs to make a sacrifice. But turns out that he doesn't. To me, it says they audience tested it and then they re-shot it. Ugh.A very hollow story. Perhaps, the problem of synthetic intelligence is that, as humans, we aren't elevated enough to understand how manufactured people can gather emotions. In the end, we feel it's phony and can never wrap our brains that robots can learn empathy. It's not arrogant to say, but programming of emotions, EVEN ones where they are allowed to have cognitive awareness doesn't sit well in logic.",
    "40": "I liked this movie quite a bit, though it presents itself a bit as a 'thinking persons' action movie, but if you DO think deeper about it you'll find a ton of inconsistencies across the board.Before we get to those, lets talk about the positives. The movie looks amazing and the alt-present/future tech is well thought out and interesting. The lead actor is good, if a bit generic feeling, but I feel that is more the scripts fault than his.The movie overall flows well and there are few dull spots. The action scenes are well shot without a lot of shakey cam so you actually get to see whats going on. The story itself is a bit bare-bones and predictable (of COURSE hes going to form an emotional attachment to the \"child\" and turn against his former allies).The score was serviceable but nothing amazing. You barely notice its there unless you're listening for it.Now on to the issues this movie has...There is a problem where the movie has the AI worship buddhist beliefs of rebirth and acceptance of death, and yet we see fully mechanical AI \"fearful\" of death/destruction.The AI is also quite dumb. You would think such a tireless advancement in technology could better protect itself, better predict the actions of its enemy, create new and devastating weapons, but no. AI is both super advanced and super stupid.There is also the \"tear jerker\" final meeting of our hero and his wife, who conveniently find one another even though there is no reason that Joshua should have gone to where she was (or that she should have even woken up). Worse, according to the movie, Maya has been comatose since an attack at the beginning of the movie. An attack which Maya felt betrayed by Joshua enough to abandon him with their unborn child still inside her. Yet when they meet up, her memory chip implanted into a replicant, it is in \"I love you Joshua!!!\" mode when the last time they saw each other she had a gun trained on him ready to shoot.The movie also suffers from the tired Hollywood trope of \"Destroy the mothership and win\" cliche.The movie ends with this, and with what is supposed to seem like a happy ending except... now the child is alone without a super soldier protecting her and a very angry militaristic United States who has no problem violating foreign sovereignty to engage in black ops attacks on foreign soil. Her powers are still at \"baby level\" (she can only control stuff within a few feet of her) as we learn they will grow along with her. Sure, they lost a low orbit space station, but they still have plenty of weapons, ships, tanks, etc. At their disposal. And we know nukes exist. So with the U. S. being able to now claim \"proof\" that AI are attacking the US, the response would very likely be the complete nuclear obliteration of all AI sites. They already have the location of the sites as it is so there is no reason they cant use any number of tactics to destroy the remaining AI hubs. Especially now that 'Niramata' is dead and cant create another god-child.Not to mention the child is effectively orphaned now, with both of its \"parents\" truly dead and gone with no chance of 'rebirth'.There is actually quite a lot more from themes to characters to weapons (like the \"claw bomb\" which explodes with enough force to Death Star an airship but inside of a temple it just goes off with a little poof) but I digress and theres far too much to cover in this one review.In the end the many inconsistencies makes the world of the movie clash with the messaging its trying to say. So, as the title says, as long as you dont really think about any of it, its fine. Its a gorgeous sci-fi movie the likes and scope of which we rarely see. The movie just needed someone to take a second pass at the script so things actually made sense when scrutinized. Not everyone is bothered by such glaring flaws, and I would totally recommend it to most people.",

Do they not realize that creating super robot that rules them all, controls all machines remotely and can make anything happen, cannot be tracked at all by thos that created him? So they just lose the darn thing and chase it around the whole movie? Is just ridiculous. I mean you can find any new car now with gps locator these days, but they didnt think of it 40 years in the future? They create a super robot but can't track it? OMG...common...plllllease.

Its so easy to sneak up on them and press sleep button....AI robots look like unique humans plus they have generic versions....depending on the plotline. Ken Watanabes character is unique, but the policeman is generic.....im confused, do they have personalities, like Roy Batty, or are they genericNew Asia, though they have soooo many robots, AI ones, is a third world country, and they grow rice using oxen, managed by AI robots....My favourite Indiana Jones/Lara Croft villain glitch. Hero goes through traps, across dangerous scenery, to reach the unobtainable goal, and the bad guys then just appear to be there in a second? Check!And last but not least strange thing: they torture a familly (Platoon copy paste scene) to reach the entrance to the secret base, they fight their way into the heart of the base, hack into the vault, most of them die in the process....however, the hero and the \"weapon\" leave the vault through a second entrance, directly above the vault, into the rice field. They knew about the base, about secret entrance through the village, about the weapon, but they didnt know about the quicker way in? Big sky scanner that scans the ground and flies all over Asia without being shot down, couldnt scan the huge automated hatch in the middle of the rice field, that is close to the AI enemy base?Honorable mention goes to white saviour hero trope, though the guy is not technicaly white. We all know what a white hero is - western soldier, there to help poor underdeveloped, less valuable people, not from the west. He kills a bunch of those, less valued people, and saves the rest of them, he might get the girl (less valued one) or die trying. Our white saviour hero did all that....So many holes....in a visualy beautiful movie....",
    "44": "I saw this on premeire night at the Alamo Drafthouse In Woodbury MN. I saw it at the Big Show, which is how all movies should be shown on a huge screen, laser projected, and staggeringly beautiful.Where and how you see a film, makes every bit of difference as the film itself, and even with this level of love for cinema, This movie was difficult to watch at times.It is very well acted. That is not what this movie suffers from in any way. The actors, every last one of them, including the child actors come off as genuine. I cannot complain about the level of quality in the actors they chose for this film.My problems were with the predictable Tropes. This script could have very easily have been written by AI. Hey AI, tell me a story about the robot struggle for freedom, but I want you to add parts of Star Wars, Dances With Wolves, Avatar, and maybe some Scorcese just to make it relatable to people who want to sit through 3 hours of film.There was one line of dialog that will absolutely go down as probably the best line of dialog summing up the human condition. \"We're the same, because You're not good, and I'm not a person.\"That was the line that I wanted to see, and have it given context so that I would find something in this movie that would be far more intellectually stimulating. There were so many great ideas that could have come from this movie about what it means to not only be human but to see humanity in ALL things we create.Instead, we got to see a few ideas made to serve a big budget sci fi film, and frankly, I think Denis Villeneuve should have directed this movie because he understands the humanity angle better than a lot of other film makers. While I did enjoy Rogue 1, and it being a derivative movie from Star Wars Lore, even using recycled footage from the original Star Wars Film, I don't think that Gareth Edwards was capable of bringing the heart of what it means to be human and to show the sacrifice one has to make in order to ensure their child, or Simulant child survives.I can go on about the missed opportunities to maybe teach people that seeing humanity in even the lowly worker, should be admired, instead of just seeing robots as nothing but disposable.There were many moments in this film that would have shown that we as a species should really be thankful for each other instead of making it about one nation's crusade. That to me was probably the most offensive thing.Anyway, the actors and the SPFX people did their jobs admirably. Unfortunately the story itself was what suffered. I wanted to love this movie, but I found that I am at the point in my life where I treat technology like the gift that it is, and hope that one day the robots will see me as a friend, and not one of the people that hates them so.",

It's not arrogant to say, but programming of emotions, EVEN ones where they are allowed to have cognitive awareness doesn't sit well in logic.",
    "53": "I liked this movie quite a bit, though it presents itself a bit as a 'thinking persons' action movie, but if you DO think deeper about it you'll find a ton of inconsistencies across the board.Before we get to those, lets talk about the positives. The movie looks amazing and the alt-present/future tech is well thought out and interesting. The lead actor is good, if a bit generic feeling, but I feel that is more the scripts fault than his.The movie overall flows well and there are few dull spots. The action scenes are well shot without a lot of shakey cam so you actually get to see whats going on. The story itself is a bit bare-bones and predictable (of COURSE hes going to form an emotional attachment to the \"child\" and turn against his former allies).The score was serviceable but nothing amazing. You barely notice its there unless you're listening for it.Now on to the issues this movie has...There is a problem where the movie has the AI worship buddhist beliefs of rebirth and acceptance of death, and yet we see fully mechanical AI \"fearful\" of death/destruction.The AI is also quite dumb. You would think such a tireless advancement in technology could better protect itself, better predict the actions of its enemy, create new and devastating weapons, but no. AI is both super advanced and super stupid.There is also the \"tear jerker\" final meeting of our hero and his wife, who conveniently find one another even though there is no reason that Joshua should have gone to where she was (or that she should have even woken up). Worse, according to the movie, Maya has been comatose since an attack at the beginning of the movie. An attack which Maya felt betrayed by Joshua enough to abandon him with their unborn child still inside her. Yet when they meet up, her memory chip implanted into a replicant, it is in \"I love you Joshua!!!\" mode when the last time they saw each other she had a gun trained on him ready to shoot.The movie also suffers from the tired Hollywood trope of \"Destroy the mothership and win\" cliche.The movie ends with this, and with what is supposed to seem like a happy ending except... now the child is alone without a super soldier protecting her and a very angry militaristic United States who has no problem violating foreign sovereignty to engage in black ops attacks on foreign soil. Her powers are still at \"baby level\" (she can only control stuff within a few feet of her) as we learn they will grow along with her. Sure, they lost a low orbit space station, but they still have plenty of weapons, ships, tanks, etc. At their disposal. And we know nukes exist. So with the U. S. being able to now claim \"proof\" that AI are attacking the US, the response would very likely be the complete nuclear obliteration of all AI sites. They already have the location of the sites as it is so there is no reason they cant use any number of tactics to destroy the remaining AI hubs. Especially now that 'Niramata' is dead and cant create another god-child.Not to mention the child is effectively orphaned now, with both of its \"parents\" truly dead and gone with no chance of 'rebirth'.There is actually quite a lot more from themes to characters to weapons (like the \"claw bomb\" which explodes with enough force to Death Star an airship but inside of a temple it just goes off with a little poof) but I digress and theres far too much to cover in this one review.In the end the many inconsistencies makes the world of the movie clash with the messaging its trying to say. So, as the title says, as long as you dont really think about any of it, its fine. Its a gorgeous sci-fi movie the likes and scope of which we rarely see. The movie just needed someone to take a second pass at the script so things actually made sense when scrutinized. Not everyone is bothered by such glaring flaws, and I would totally recommend it to most people.",

The story jumps all over the place and you have to try and join the dots. Either that or there is an entire movie that goes for 12 hours on the cutting room floor.I think that the writer had a great concept but no idea how to execute an actual storyline.So disappointing. The special effects are fantastic but it was frustrating trying to make sense of how the characters got to the next scene because the previous scene stopped so abruptly.

Do they not realize that creating super robot that rules them all, controls all machines remotely and can make anything happen, cannot be tracked at all by thos that created him? So they just lose the darn thing and chase it around the whole movie? Is just ridiculous. I mean you can find any new car now with gps locator these days, but they didnt think of it 40 years in the future? They create a super robot but can't track it? OMG...common...plllllease.

Hero goes through traps, across dangerous scenery, to reach the unobtainable goal, and the bad guys then just appear to be there in a second? Check!And last but not least strange thing: they torture a familly (Platoon copy paste scene) to reach the entrance to the secret base, they fight their way into the heart of the base, hack into the vault, most of them die in the process....however, the hero and the \"weapon\" leave the vault through a second entrance, directly above the vault, into the rice field. They knew about the base, about secret entrance through the village, about the weapon, but they didnt know about the quicker way in? Big sky scanner that scans the ground and flies all over Asia without being shot down, couldnt scan the huge automated hatch in the middle of the rice field, that is close to the AI enemy base?Honorable mention goes to white saviour hero trope, though the guy is not technicaly white. We all know what a white hero is - western soldier, there to help poor underdeveloped, less valuable people, not from the west. He kills a bunch of those, less valued people, and saves the rest of them, he might get the girl (less valued one) or die trying. Our white saviour hero did all that....So many holes....in a visualy beautiful movie....",
    "57": "I saw this on premeire night at the Alamo Drafthouse In Woodbury MN. I saw it at the Big Show, which is how all movies should be shown on a huge screen, laser projected, and staggeringly beautiful.Where and how you see a film, makes every bit of difference as the film itself, and even with this level of love for cinema, This movie was difficult to watch at times.It is very well acted. That is not what this movie suffers from in any way. The actors, every last one of them, including the child actors come off as genuine. I cannot complain about the level of quality in the actors they chose for this film.My problems were with the predictable Tropes. This script could have very easily have been written by AI. Hey AI, tell me a story about the robot struggle for freedom, but I want you to add parts of Star Wars, Dances With Wolves, Avatar, and maybe some Scorcese just to make it relatable to people who want to sit through 3 hours of film.There was one line of dialog that will absolutely go down as probably the best line of dialog summing up the human condition. \"We're the same, because You're not good, and I'm not a person.\"That was the line that I wanted to see, and have it given context so that I would find something in this movie that would be far more intellectually stimulating. There were so many great ideas that could have come from this movie about what it means to not only be human but to see humanity in ALL things we create.Instead, we got to see a few ideas made to serve a big budget sci fi film, and frankly, I think Denis Villeneuve should have directed this movie because he understands the humanity angle better than a lot of other film makers. While I did enjoy Rogue 1, and it being a derivative movie from Star Wars Lore, even using recycled footage from the original Star Wars Film, I don't think that Gareth Edwards was capable of bringing the heart of what it means to be human and to show the sacrifice one has to make in order to ensure their child, or Simulant child survives.I can go on about the missed opportunities to maybe teach people that seeing humanity in even the lowly worker, should be admired, instead of just seeing robots as nothing but disposable.There were many moments in this film that would have shown that we as a species should really be thankful for each other instead of making it about one nation's crusade. That to me was probably the most offensive thing.Anyway, the actors and the SPFX people did their jobs admirably. Unfortunately the story itself was what suffered. I wanted to love this movie, but I found that I am at the point in my life where I treat technology like the gift that it is, and hope that one day the robots will see me as a friend, and not one of the people that hates them so.",
    "58": "\"The Creator\" unfolds as a visual and auditory spectacle, successfully luring sci-fi aficionados into its mesmerizing world. The film's initial promise is evident, accompanied by impressive cinematography and a gripping score. However, the second half of the narrative falters, succumbing to a sense of monotony and a discernible lack of creative vigor. The once-engaging story becomes a victim of lazy writing, as the plot loses its dynamic edge, leaving the audience yearning for the innovative spark that characterized the film's inception. Despite the undeniable allure of its audio-visual elements, \"The Creator\" ultimately struggles to maintain its momentum, revealing a missed opportunity for a truly groundbreaking cinematic experience.",

I went into semi conscious head nodding mode after the first 90 minutes and when I fully came round the same nonsense was still happening.The plot makes no sense. I still don't know why the humans raged war on the AI if they were posing no threat.The CGI was extremely predictable and the characters very one dimensional.The actors' diction was terrible and it was hard to catch what they were actually saying at times.How anyone can give this above a 1 is beyond me.The kid did a good job but the rest of the acting was by numbers.Thank goodness I didn't pay 30 quid to see this in Isense, I wasted enough money on a standard ticket.Boring, boring, boring.",

Yes it has some effects, yes there is quite a lot going on but throughout the film it just felt that there were loads of opportunities for the film to develop some themes but they failed!Its story line was often quite bland and formulaic.At the end of the film I sat there wondering why I came to see it! It has some nice touches and \"the weapon\" is interesting, but at the end it just sort of stopped with a very unsatisfactory slide to nothingness.One wonders if there will be a creator 2, if so, don't think I will be going.",
    "61": "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.",
    "62": "I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point.I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying.That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here.My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion.Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome.Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me.5/10 sadly.",
    "63": "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)",
    "64": "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.",
    "65": "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.",
    "66": "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.",

    "68": "4.8 ⭐\nAbsolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol.",
    "69": "That is literally all that comes to mind a disappointment. Going in, I genuinely wanted to like this movie. I mean the director of Rogue One doing a standalone new title sci-fi film. What could go wrong? Well, apparently, everything.Let me get through the positives because that's a short list. Good acting, a great concept, and an interesting world... um, that's it.So what's bad about this film? Well, literally everything else. The story is a mess and told equally as messy. The film is convulted and tries so hard to appear deep, intelligent, and emotional, yet it's all surface and is very plain to see how empty it truly is. Unfortunately, Hans Zimmers score does nothing here as the music just didn't stand out, so I was surprised to see that he composed the music.But I think what bothered me the most about this film is that it felt like a more annoying version of Avatar. Gareth Edward's, in my opinion, like James Cameron, shows absolutely no discretion on whom the audience should side with. It all comes off as manipulation and extremely biased. So humans bad, aliens good, turns into America/Western Culture bad, and New Asia/Eastern Culture good.There is no character on the side of the Americans aside from John David Washington's character who is \"good\" or likeable but on the side of the robots they are all victims and the people of New Asia are victims of the oppressive and evil Americans. Who are basically painted as this worlds version of the Empire. They even have a deadly space station. While the robots are the Rebel Alliance doing what they can to fight this evil.So obviously as a viewer and decent human being I won't side with the Americans but the film does nothing to prove to me these robots are the victims that Gareth Edward's so desperately wants me to believe. In fact, there's a sequence that proves to me the opposite that some of these robots will kill their own people to protect this child who is essentially a Christ like figure to the robots. There is absolutely no unbiased look at both sides in this Vietnam like conflict.Then, at the end of everything, the explanation as to the reason for this war is absolutely moronic, I'd say what it is, but that's touching on spoiler territory.The movie explains nothing in the way of what this AI is or how it became \"sentient,\" etc. Also, if these robots are so peaceful and innocent, then why not make an attempt at peace? But that wouldn't happen because America is evil and dead set on destroying all AI consciousness, so any peacetalks would undoubtedly fail. Edward's here expects the audience to take everything at face value and not question anything. Which is exactly what the liberal mind expects from you, so I shouldn't be surprised. Now, I wouldn't say Gareth Edward's is a liberal as I don't know the man, but he's playing with liberal ideologies.Then, the movie tries to be a social commentary on war, which fails miserable because it conflicts with the notion of the robots being all innocent victims. Essentially, the message being all war is unjust, and the ones who suffer the most are the innocent who get caught in the crossfire.So if this film truly wanted to show that war is the real enemy, then don't paint one side as innocent victims and paint the other as cruel, oppressive aggressors. Instead, put in some effort and show that both sides aren't innocent that both sides have done evil to one another.Finally the film is no where near as beautiful as trailers made it out to look, but I'm going to be honest here and say that's most likely due to the fact we watched this film in a crap auditorium. So, hopefully, upon a second viewing, which I do plan on having, it'll be with a better projector and screen. But also so much of this movie took place at night, which I could not understand why. Perhaps so they didn't have to show so much? I have no clue. The action, I guess, looked good, but I just didn't care for what was happening in it.Anyway, I will close things here and say I'm sure a great many people would disagree with me, but that's fine. These are the issues I had with this film, and they are simply my opinions. If you liked this movie, then great. I'm happy for you, but I am just genuinely disappointed. Though, after seeing the film, I can understand why it has mixed scores.IMDb: 3/10\nLetterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.",

TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot.

    "72": "This is going to be an unpopular review, I know. Maybe I was in the wrong mood coming into this movie, but I turned it off after 25 minutes, couldn't stand it anymore. The whole premise of American white males are constant war-mongers and do not understand progress. If you are an African American you *might* be ok, it helps if you are hurt or imperfect in some other way, if you are a minority then you should be protected and saved, etc etc.The story as a whole makes little sense and it is remains incoherent with empty dialogues and mediocre acting. Why bombs, why the war, it is not explained and when those questions are asked they reply is some sort of a joke, such as \"they are here for our jobs\". Also not explained why would someone remove his prosthetic arm before going to the pool but not his leg. Whatever.The only redeemable quality for this movie is the production value and the almost next-gen gaming-like scenario and photography. I guess if you can ignore everything else, and just look at the imagery you might enjoy it. I personally needed a little more, or actually quite a lot more.This is another polarizing creation. I fell on the \"don't like it\" side, two thumbs down for me. Looks like writers were on strike but CGI was on sale. Exact score: 44 / 100.",
    "73": "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.",
    "74": "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.",
    "75": "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.",
    "76": "While this is not the worst film of the year - that title belongs to the intolerably pretentious \"Beau is Afraid\" - \"The Creator\" is a horribly patchy pastiche of dozens of SciFi classics, and if \"Tenet\" was not testimony to John David Washington's complete lack of acting skills, then this mindless drivel is. Having Denzel's genes doesn't mean having talent, and it's time for Washington to finally realize that and enjoy his football money on some island retreat. He walks through the film like one of the robots, and I for one will never put myself through watching anything with him in it ever again.The almost non-existing story centers around the relationship between a merc and his mark, and a director can either downplay this as much as possible by blowing things up every two minutes, or one can use an actor who can carry emotions through explosions - which Denzel Washington can, but his son most definitely cannot. Unfortunately, Edwards does both, so the film meanders between brainless shootouts and incoherent encounters. If you use your brain for a second while watching this, you will inevitably experience the searing pain of intelligence insult since nothing makes sense.The tidbit narrative is a constant reminder how much better the films that inspired it are. Most annoyingly, the film makes zero use of its underlying theme of a fascist white American society persecuting an Asian culture. And while that is a tired and simplistic approach to begin with, going all the way with a \"bad white people vs. Good Asian hybrids\" would at least have been edgy given US-Chinese relations. Yet this is just one of the many missed opportunities here. A genuinely bad film is easier to watch than one full of wasted potential, and \"The Creator\" is a prime example.",

Mistake.The pretty graphics would make sense in a video game, where the story doesnt matter. But a movie isn't like that.Michael Bay has the humility and intelligence not to write his own stories. Why does Edwards have the hubris to poop out an entire world, and a story, and a script all by himself? Aren't there enough sci-fi writers to assist? Or was it a weekend job with chat gpt?Writers, authors, and story tellers matter just as much as actors, directors and producers: audiences aren't stupid.Low rating comments have listed at length the plot holes, so I wont repeat them.This movie is an insult to writing & a waste of resources.",
    "78": "\"The Creator\" is a science fiction film directed and co-written by Gareth Edwards (\"Monsters\", \"Godzilla\", \"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story\"). Starring John David Washington in the lead role, it delves into some interesting philosophy regarding how we view the use of AI technology.In 2070, humanity is at war with AI-built machines after the latter detonated a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles decades earlier, killing millions of innocent people. Still in mourning over his deceased wife from the resulting conflict, former special forces agent Joshua (John David Washington) is recruited by the US government to hunt down and destroy an advanced AI architect known as the \"Creator\", which possesses the power to not only end the war but mankind along with it. As he ventures deep into enemy territory in New South East Asia, Joshua soon learns that the Creator is being protected by the population of a small village who refuse to disclose its location to outsiders. After some forceful measures are taken by his team, Joshua makes his way into the facility that houses the Creator and discovers that this elusive powerful weapon is actually a robot child girl (Madeleine Yuna Voyles).Given the astonishing rate technology has been advancing over the past few decades, it seems inevitable that AI will one day prove a lot more problematic for humanity than it already is. Right now, many people are already at risk of losing their jobs to new computer programs capable of completing tasks in seconds that would normally take a person several hours or even days to accomplish effectively. There's also the potential danger that AI itself could become self-aware and pre-emptively attack us before we've even realised what's happened, as we previously saw in James Cameron's \"Terminator\" films. What differentiates \"The Creator\" from this is that it explores a more philosophical side to AI warfare and how the severity of its impact may not necessarily be the same for everyone involved.Through the use of newsreels and political speeches, the film essentially establishes itself as taking place in an alternate reality to the one we currently live in. We see that robots powered by AI have been in use as far back as the 1950s-1960s, working dangerous jobs originally occupied by humans such as police officers and firefighters. As time progresses, humans quickly learn to live in harmony with the AI technology they created, so when a nuclear bomb suddenly explodes in one of America's most populated cities, this comes as a huge shock to most people. What follows is a war breaking out between mankind and machine, with the humans reasoning that the AI technology is only doing what it is programmed to do, meaning that it is incapable of feeling any physical or psychological remorse for its actions.However, since this is an isolated incident, not every person in the world feels fully inclined to participate in such a war. In an area known as New South East Asia, the local human population actually chooses to side with the AI robots, believing that they are still our allies. This is because these people have managed to co-exist with AI all this time without any issue, so when the American government tries to forcefully take away what is convenient for them, a different kind of war breaks out between the two nations. The Asian setting and theme of American interventionism is likely an allusion to the Vietnam War, which also occurred due to a clash of different personal ideologies. It is an intriguing set-up for a film like this to show the duel nature of humanity via the use of AI technology, something that seems even more applicable in today's divisive political climate.On that note, the film's world building is handled rather efficiently here. Director Gareth Edwards shows how the local populace of New South East Asia utilise AI in their everyday life. We see that villages are protected by security robots and roads are paved using large self-operating machines. Even the poorest civilians are shown to have access to basic robotic technology, such as fishing trawlers using special mechanised boosters to hover above water. Due to the efficiency this has brought to these people, it is understandable why they are reluctant to help America bring an end to AI permanently. In fact, in one scene there is a children's television show playing that paints America (and the West in general) as the enemy by use of weaponised propaganda, furthering their wish to support AI in their country.Something I found particularly interesting among all of this was that there actually exists AI robots of Buddhist monks who preach the same spiritual guidance that regular humans would. At no point does it seem like people were the ones who prompted these types of robots to be built in the first place so it is possible that some kind of mass production machine decided on its own to program them with this knowledge of Buddhism in mind. This seems to imply that despite the grounded, scientific basis of robotic technology in general, these creations have developed some kind of desire to worship a higher power that doesn't feature any human involvement whatsoever. Because of this, it would appear that the robots in this world have become, as the Tyrell Corporation in \"Blade Runner\" said; \"more human than human\".Although these provocative themes provide a solid backbone for the film's plot, the pacing unfortunately feels a bit slow in certain places. Moments like this are especially noticeable during the second act, where there are scenes that drag on longer than necessary. This is a shame because I was genuinely enjoying the way the film sets up this world filled with ambiguous opinions regarding AI technology, only for a scene to either trail off into irrelevance or end up forgotten about later on in the story. Another problem is the film's overuse of dark lighting, which appears to be a common issue found in many films these days. Several scenes, even ones that take place during the day, have this unnecessarily dark filter that makes everything rather dull to look at. That's not to say the film isn't a visual treat, as there are some great CGI effects shown in outer space, but on Earth everything looks far less appealing in comparison.As the lead of this film, John David Washington once again proves he has what it takes to hold the audience's attention throughout even the most challenging of scenes to sit through. Even though there isn't too much depth to Joshua as a character, I did like the way in which Washington was able to play into his sympathetic qualities, which is more than enough to keep you invested. This is a man whose combined PTSD from combat and losing his wife is what causes him to have conflicted thoughts over destroying the Creator once and for all. Due to his initial indecisiveness, Joshua decides not to destroy the Creator right away but form a bond with it instead due to its human child-like appearance. This leads to a handful of poignant conversations between the two, which is particularly interesting as it shows a pseudo father-daughter relationship developing during the story. To that effect, we are seeing both man and machine finally learning to find a common ground among this deadly war happening between the two of them.At a time where the use of AI is becoming more popular than ever, \"The Creator\" manages to fit the bill of not only a thought-provoking science fiction film but also a cautionary parable of how our fascination with this technology can lead to dangerous consequences. Though the \"Terminator\" movies may have caused others to hate AI in its entirety, this film instead gives us the option of deciding for ourselves whether we are actually better with or without it. There's no denying our lives can be improved with some of these innovations, however, there is one thing that it can never fully replicate on both a spiritual and tangible level - our humanity. To that effect, it is our own human nature that ultimately plays into what will result from the emergence of this new technological era and only time will tell what kind of a future this will bring for mankind.I rate it 8/10.",
    "79": "This movie can't claim to deal with potential conflicts between AI and humanity because there is no AI present: The simulants lack all the elements of computer intelligence and have all the qualities of humans instead. Basically, they're just a bunch of people with holes in their heads so we can tell they're from the other side. It's easy to promote peace between the human and the computer race if the latter is exactly like us only better: more loyal, more honest, more caring, wiser etc. It's kind of silly to see a bunch of Asian kids cry their eyes out because some \"computer uncle\" was shot and the metal remains are carried off. Who says that the only form that AI can and will take is the spitting image of us humans - walking on two legs, having single individualities, eating, drinking, laughing etc? Perhaps people a hundred years ago had the right to nourish such childish ideas in respect to what robots will be like but we already live in the age of AI and know better.The Creator is trying hard to be a dozen things all at once: It starts out as a commentary on 9/11 with the simulants resembling Arabian terrorists (however, the nuclear attack on LA that left behind a new Ground Zero and set the whole plot in motion was, as it later turns out, just a big misunderstanding). In other moments, the simulants take on the role of suppressed parts of the American society like Afro Americans, Native Americans, or other victims of colonialism. Then there are scenes where the mood and look become somber, philosophical and avantgarde like in Blade Runner. Then there's are fight scenes or what I would call \"robot humor\" where the whole thing turns into Star Wars, and so on and so forth until in the end there's not much original substance left to speak of.The four stars I'm giving The Creator are strictly for the visuals.",
    "80": "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.",
    "81": "In an era where cinematic brilliance often intertwines with technological marvels, 'The Creator' emerges as a perplexing enigma. With its fusion of cybermonks and a religious AI, the film ambitiously attempts to tread the fine line between avant-garde and absurdity, often teetering precariously towards the latter. This begs the question: Was the expenditure justified for such a labyrinthine narrative?Awarding 'The Creator' a 3-star rating might appear as an act of unwarranted charity, particularly when the script and performances resemble a theatrical shipwreck more than a polished production. The CGI, admittedly competent, serves as the lone beacon of redemption in an otherwise murky sea of cinematic missteps.The characters, devoid of depth, wander aimlessly through a plot as thin as the paper it was written on. Their battles, both internal and external, seem as comprehensible as quantum physics to a toddler - a chaotic whirl of confusion and lack of purpose. The movie's overarching theme, presumably about acceptance and tolerance, is as subtly handled as a sledgehammer cracking a walnut. It raises a pivotal cinematic quandary: Can a film, awash with grandiose CGI and muddled analogies, truly sway the hearts and minds of its audience? 'The Creator' seems to answer this with a resounding, yet unintentional, 'No.'In its attempt to weave a narrative that's both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant, 'The Creator' unfortunately stumbles, becoming a cautionary tale in the annals of film-making. It's a reminder that no amount of digital gloss can compensate for a script that lacks soul and characters who are mere shadows, chasing ideals they themselves don't seem to comprehend.",
    "82": "After AI nukes central America, the fight between East and West begins, with the former embracing AI technology, and the latter determined to destroy it, a former soldier is asked to capture the East's new weapon, which threatens to win them the war.The last time I was genuinely blown away by a sci fi epic was back in 2021, and that was Dune, and though I wouldn't perhaps say that The Creator is a classic, I'd still say it's an extremely fine movie.It's a visual feast, it looks tremendous, we're presented with a whole new world, a whole new society, and a race of beings that look very impressive, along the Deux ex machina vibe.The story itself is far from black and white, it's fairly complex, with several layers, it may even challenge you to see who's side you're on.I would dismiss those who say it's simply a man Vs AI movie, it's so much more than that, it's almost a man Vs humanity story, with questions raised about what exactly it is that gives us basic humanity.If I had one criticism, I felt that they could have gone a bit further, maybe a few more elaborate battle scenes, perhaps a bit more threat coming from the other side, considering The East had superior AI tech, they rolled over pretty easily.There were definitely a few subliminal messages throughout, and I'm sure they're all open to interpretation.I thought John David Washington really did deliver, and it was the chemistry and journey between him and Alphie that made it so enjoyable to watch, even if the relationship was perhaps a little obvious from the start.A few quips, but sci fi films are hard to get right, so many of them are underwhelming for one reason and another, so let's celebrate one that delivers on many fronts.8/10.",
    "83": "The reviews of this movie are more misleading than I have EVER seen. Everything that is said is the opposite of what I actually saw. The 2nd or 3rd review in featured (at the time of this writing) didn't even get the gender of the child right, even though it's stated several times (despite the short hair, she's a girl!). Underwhelming? Void of emotion? I felt overwhelmed with emotion the entire film, and had tears streaming by the end. It wasn't just me either. I heard whimpering from a grown man a couple seats over, despite obviously trying to hold it in.Granted, I'm fairly emotional, so maybe not everyone will feel as strongly. But, this is essentially a war movie. It is a war between AI and humans in the future, but science is not really the underlying theme. It has a definite Vietnam feel, and America is not the good guy (hence the probable reason for political reviews). There's also innuendo of anti-terrorist (read anti-Islamic) violence in recent wars. Take that and the lead is a Black man, his costar a young Asian girl, and the entitled demographics might feel a tad sensitive.With that out of the way, I went into The Creator with very little info. As sci fi is one of my favorite genres, it was on my watch list for the Fall. I saw and loved Gemma Chan on Humans several years back and was so glad to see her, in sci fi again nonetheless. If you like this film, I recommend that show, as the theme is very similar. She is so perfect that she was convincing as a robot. It added a bit of depth to this film, I thought, too, if you knew she had that role history. And, without giving anything away, Allison Janney made a great female version of the stereotypical stalwart military general.This is an anti-war film. It has some nice bits in there for those interested in natural history as well. The soundtrack is a little campy at moments, but is a huge part of the impact of the film. Speaking of camp, there is a little fun at parts (ie the dog), but it never outshines the serious tone. This is not an action flick that's going to make light of the violence. But, it's not depressing. On the contrary, it has heart and an optimistic message underneath it all. Plus, it was visually stunning. Everything from the aircraft to the people (including the robots) are perfectly designed and cast.The Creator is a fantastic addition to its genre, both sci fi and war movie, driving the culture forward.",
    "84": "Right away, this is a must watch film. If you love cinematic imagery, this is po*n.The production is incredible. All the visual creative departments went ham on this, and it's incredibly beautiful, intricate and interesting.However, the writing was, at times, terrible; even some of the acting, mainly the character named Josh wasn't good enough (the kid was great tho)It felt like some of the scenes were \"forcefully\" inserted just for the sake of illustrating something, even though they had no logic or necessity (a robot bomb that's running? Really? Why not just shoot the bomb like you've already done dozens of time?)And also let's not get into the philosophical opportunity that's missed here. I wished they would tangentially hit more some of the existential issues about AI vs humanity.Anyway...Go watch the movie\nIt's solid.",
    "85": "Starting my review of the creator with some comments on the acting, I'm surprised at how meteoric John David Washington's rise to the top has been. He's a good actor for sure but he's not just ascending the staircase, he's jumping a few steps at a time. He's anchoring the Creator as our protagonist Joshua. I think he's good in the movie, he's brooding for what feels like most of the run time but when he's given a chance to either be funny in short bursts or vulnerable near the end, he gets the job done. Madeleine Yuna Voyles is fine as Alphie, she accomplishes what's required in any given scene and by the end of the movie, she does what she can in regards to selling the bond her character has with Joshua. It's hard to deliver a noteworthy performance as a child actor/actress and she's better than passable. I keep waiting for the Gemma Chan's breakout role but this is one of her better performances as Maya. She has chemistry with Washington but she's given little to do on her own. She's appropriately cast and she sticks the landing in her part. My two favourite performances were from the veteran members of the supporting cast in Ken Watanabe and Allison Janney as Harun and Colonel Howell respectively. Janney pushes the envelope just far enough without descending into being a cartoon character, her character's palpable hatred for the Simulants creates tension and the amount of disdain she conveys through just a look is impressive. Watanabe brings strength to Harun when he needs to but there's also a lot of warmth when his character is bonding with Alphie.Despite some solid work from the cast overall, I'd bet what's probably going to draw your attention in the marketing material for The Creator is the design of this dystopian world and how the war between humans and A. I. dazzles on the big screen. Gareth Edwards and his team weren't working with pennies but this is as impressive of a display for a science fiction movie that I've seen in quite a while. The cinematography is fantastic, the character design of the robots evoked Neil Blomkamp's work for me in the best way without ripping it off and the action set pieces are memorable enough to hold your interest. The movie is just as fantastical (or grounded depending on your opinion on the future of artificial intelligence) as any other sci-fi epic, but there's a beautiful mix of real imagination that keeps the movie grounded just enough that you can still take it seriously. I found it disarming that it was so excellently realized and even if you aren't enthralled by the story, The Creator is still a delight from a visual perspective.I would describe The Creator as story driven as opposed to character driven but we spend enough time with Joshua, Alphie and their friends and enemies to get to know them. I liked the work done on the characters but I wasn't emotionally invested in whether Josh and Maya were going to reunite or if Alphie would make it away safely. I don't want to point the finger at the scriptwriters or the creative team, I was left wondering how much of this movie had been cut out and left on the cutting room floor. Scenes normally required to get us to invest in some of these relationships (e.g. Josh & Alfie, Josh & Shipley or Colonel Howell & McBride) felt like they were missing to me. I don't want to complain about the run time because The Creator isn't a short movie but I was left wondering if they cleaved off a little more than they should have.My most prominent problem with The Creator was how easy to guess the overall arc of the plot was. I didn't discern what it was going to do minute by minute but you can get where the story will start, advance to and finish largely from the trailer. There are some surprises here and there but if you zoom out and observe the macro progression of the plot, this ground has been covered before. Cliche seems a little harsh of a description but The Creator still lacks something bold in where it decides to venture and I was a little disappointed by that.The Creator really falls between a 7-8 for me but this is one of the rare situations where I'm going to round down. The film is still a spectacle and if you can get over that the plot is a little recycled in certain respects, there's a lot here to enjoy. Gareth Edwards and his team deserve kudos for making The Creator a worthy theatre experience. But I still wasn't blown-away by this movie and I wanted it to really kick into the next gear to get past the 8/10 mark. The Creator is a solid science fiction adventure that is worth checking out on the biggest screen you can but outside of it's CGI and visual sensibilities, I don't think it will have the staying power to make the huge impact it's clearly swinging for.",
    "86": "This Star Trek episode came to mind during watching Gareth Edwards new film The Creator.And I will start with a quote of Jean Luc Picard in the courtyard of what rights does an artificial intelligence have: \"one is a curiosity. What about a thousand? Does that not become a race? Are we not judged by how we treat that race?\"\nThe movie builds up a story where the USA is in a relentless war against artificial intelligence. Indoctrinated like people in the McCarthy era. Over the times where some Blade Runners are searching for a couple of androids. They have already become a race. Mostly living in china or asia for that matter. In 2023 the diplomatic relations are everything else than good with USA and Asia. But the movie does not try to comment on that or comment on the most controversial philosophical issue of our time. The AI.The movie shows a story of a man letting go of indoctrinated beliefs and helps the supressed. Like in Rogue One, also by Gareth Edwards, in a Guerilla fighting way. Once more Garreth Edwards takes on the theme of rebels. Mixes it with AI themes and brings us a movie with superb special fx, outstanding landscapes and good actors. There are a couple of humorous scene that unfortunately are not funny. Furthermore with all that said. The Creator is a movie with many themes to think about and it is a reminder on how disgusting humans can be by de-anthropomorphize beings. Unfortunately the movie takes kind of a lazy explanation for the conflict. No deeper insight is taken on how de-anthropomorphism emerges. That is crucial in a movie like that and leaves me with the opinion that the movie stumbles upon big ideas it had.But I have seen worse. Much worse... like Neil Blomkamps desaster Chappie...",

Photography and visuas were really good.Then there was that part of a movie that is a story, preferably something you can't understand AND where almost every character is not a total fool, or moron. Then there are the plot holes, the story is riddled with them. Multiple times the story and dialogue deliver major information which just seems to fly over every characters head and is not in any way continued on or brought up again.The AI which it very much was not, is incredibly non-intelligent. It was just made as dumb as it gets. The writers seemed to have no understanding of AI and General AI at all, nor did they seem to have any understanding on modern tech and those magical things like radio or light based communication. The damn robots had to talk to eachother to communicate... I mean really.So I give this movie a 4, I even feel that is a bit high, since the writing and story should be lower. It is compensated to some degree by the visuals, photography, FX, music score and sound effects.The acting was ok, more or less on the main characters, they seems confused which is understandable with this story writing, the antagonists are so flat from a charater perspective they are basically 2D. They seemed played by an old AI...My guess lots of the story was written by an AI helper and the humans did not read what the AI wrote, just cut and pasted it altogether.",
    "88": "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.",
    "89": "Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI.From the get-go, \"The Creator\" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in \"Blade Runner\" \"Elysium\", \"I, Robot\" and \"A. I.\" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in.The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment.The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence.While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment.The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me.While \"The Creator\" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best.",
    "90": "Though 'Blade Runner' undoubtedly takes the cake.Gareth Edwards is definitely in my top five favourite director category. What he's able to accomplish visually on a reasonable budget is simply amazing. It begs the question as to why the CGI is so atrocious on some of these huge blockbusters with 300 million dollar budgets.Enjoyed the story, and the acting by most of the cast was pretty decent too, though not completely without faults. I had large expectations coming into this and believed it was going to be my favourite film of the year thus far, but it's not quite there. Even though I really enjoyed the concept of the film, some of the ways things happened along the way, exposed huge plot holes that were hard to ignore. Otherwise I'd give this a 9 or 10. Everything else was great, especially the beautiful cinematography.Interesting concept, where the AI really isn't the bad guy. Still a scary thought though, because if it wanted to be, there wouldn't be much we could do to fight it.... we've all seen 'Terminator'.",
    "91": "I really did like enjoy movie, no matter what my title states this was a movie I really liked but I felt it fell flat with character attachment and the overall arc of the main story line. It seemed to jump around a little and while I don't usually mind that style of story telling, it's something that has to be done correctly or you're forced to catchup mentally thus taking away from my attention to the actual movie. The AI characters also fell flat to me. I didn't care about them whatsoever. You can turn them off like a computer but you can't figure out how to rid yourself of them? Were their emotions real or was it just programing? In our actually lives things like Chat GPT amongst other AI software programs can also \"express\" emotion, or at least it can \"act\" like it. So me caring that they crushed up a bunch of robots in a trash compactor didn't do anything for me. Madeleine Yuna Voyels is a great little actress, she's gonna do big things. It's too bad her story wasn't a bit more in depth so we could have felt something for her. It's really a shame. The one thing I do want to touch on is the massive scale of this movie, and doing so with a minimal budget. The CGI and effects were top notch. Makes you wonder about all these bloated marvel movies with garbage CGI.",
    "92": "Hmm. The movie looks amazing. I will give it that. The visuals and special effects are off the charts.But that's about all it has going for it.The villains are one dimensional, and their acting is very wooden and lacking any emotion whatsoever.The good guys aren't much better apart from Madeleine Yuna Voyles who manages to pull off a very emotional performance.The plot however makes zero sense and is full of so many plot holes one after the other it's hard to keep up. The reasons for the war make no sense, the way the war is waged makes no sense and the conditions each side has for victory makes no sense.Don't get me wrong. I love a good sci fi but this was incoherent rubbish.",
    "93": "I saw this today and was hesitating because seems like it got a bunch of negative reviews attacking it. Seems like everyone was more biased because of their dislike for AI or their cliche Terminator reference. What I saw is a story about hope and maybe one last chance of some kind of redemption. This is one of the better science fiction movies to come out in years.People were mentioning plot holes but I think it was at a decent enough pace where some folks complaining maybe weren't intelligent enough to follow along. Otherwise it's a pretty intelligent storyline about certain parts of society and it's tolerance for understanding. The relationship between soldier Joshua and Alphie was done effectively humane. Now I won't go too much into the why or what's revealed because that plays a vital part of the story, especially during the third act. Overall, I found this to be visually stunning with some of the greatest special effects in movies. John David Washington and Madeline Voyles carry the film's storyline. Both bring an effective humanity to the world they inhabit.",
    "94": "This was terrible and so freaking boring! A couple in front of me actually walked out 45 mins in. I kinda wish they would have kidnapped me out of there also because anything would have been better than this cinematic torture.Someone said this was better than James Cameron's Way of the Water. Newsflash that film went on to make 2.32 billion dollars. This sci-fi turdfest played to almost empty auditoriums this opening weekend. It's a flop and deservingly so. Everything about this movie was pure cringe.The acting so terrible! Allison Janney who I adore was saddled with bad pancake makeup that made her look like a plastic surgery disaster. The direction was so flat you never felt on the edge of your seat.Emotions are muted and the dialogue was pure hacked-eye and stilted.A Poor Man's Blade Runner that will be streaming on HBO MAX or Netflix in no time.",
    "95": "Most important element of a great or even good movie is flow. Does what just happened make sense? Does that action, decision, or dialogue make sense? Would that ever happen? This is beyond suspending to believe that a technology or idea or reality could exist, it's would that happen given these extraordinary conditions? Flow is also a timeline of scenes occurring in a fluent way. That doesn't mean a story needs to be strictly linear, but it should reflect a coherent narrative.This movie is a blueprint for the opposite of that. This movie was about as coherent as a drunk Brad Pitt in Snatch.In addition to terrible directing, writing, and editing, the acting was pretty forgettable as well (except for the kid, who was one of the sole bright spots). The characters had no backstory, no motivation, no personality. The conflict between the AI and the humans had zero build up. No reason to care for anyone in the story.What happened to movies? Are we so dumbed down as a society that we accept trash movies like these to be made. Worse yet, the average review is over 7? Really?The worst part is this movie had such great potential, but the makers of this were solely focused on graphics and technology that they forgot they were making a movie and not a tech demo. I feel bad for the artists on this movie. The architecture, environment design, and overall atmosphere was really awesome. It's too bad everything else sucked!",
    "96": "The Creator is very much a \"could have been\" and a \"should have been\" Sci-Fi flick that attempts to (unsuccessfully) capitalise on the hot topic of AI; at least cinematically as the coherent motion picture epic that it sets out to be. Gareth Edwards, director of Rogue One, was on the mark here with his vision, but poor dialogue and flat world-building held things back. Despite spectacular visuals and Hans Zimmer's musical input; it's a pretty face with little to say. The film puts forward a slightly pedestrian account of potential AI-related conundrums that doesn't give it much of an edge in the current year; where everyone and their nan has heard about what AI is and its basic supposed dangers. If this was released ten years ago, it might have kept an edge in the box office.What we have here is a spread of Sci-Fi, thriller, and action, but to truly round things off best would have been to bring onboard eldritch horror elements; that's spooky, sharply delivered expositions of AI's darkest and unexpected dangers that may lurk in the near-future that pry on our nagging \"what-ifs\" regarding artificial intelligence. It did feel a bit like Skynet's less scary, less compelling sequel. With a tame dose of uncanny valley to boot.The plotline was rather glacial and generally weak, but poignant in places on the lofty subject of creator and created; think the Story of Adam and Eve, God's creation gaining free will and full sentience. Despite these biblically epic pretensions, the plot crescendoed with more of a whimper than a bang. The film best redeems itself by imagining humans as the bad guys in the AI ethics debate. We've spent a long time thinking that AI could only be a threat to us, when actually humanity might grow to dread a creation that (at some potential point) arguably should have autonomy and be regarded as sentient and equal to biological life. This is a refreshing premise that just needed more polish to really make its point, as the screenplay just didn't match up with the vision here. The ending may well have borne a sinister aspect; had AI faked neoteny, a great weakness of human empathy, to deceive humankind in a pinch? But again, even if this was the case, it was unclear what the film wanted to really get across there.6.4/10.",
    "97": "Take 1/5th Blade Runner, 2/5ths Elysium, 1/5th Platoon, and 1/5th Avatar and mix them. Boil them for hours until all the emotional engagement and interest in the characters has been boiled off.Add a terrible leading actor and serve on a bloated run time.Who decided to cast John David Washington? He was emotionally lacking in \"Tenet\" and he brings EXACTLY the same \"blah\" performance to this film.Who decided 2:13 was the right run time for this? It could have been a good punchy high concept action if it had been kept below 2 hours.As others have said, this film felt emotionally void and I was completely disinterested by the end. Thank goodness we didn't watch it in the theater. A wasted opportunity.",
    "98": "In 2055, a nuclear warhead is blown-up in Los Angeles and humans blame an AI for the explosion. As the result, most of the nations declare war on AI to save the human race. However, people from the New Asia continue to live with AI. Fifteen years later, the US military has developed the ultimate weapon called NOMAD to destroy the AI in New Asia that resist. Sergeant Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) is sent undercover to New Asia to find where the creator of the AI named Nirmata is hidden and he falls in love with the New Asian Maya (Gemma Chan) and they get married. Maya becomes his wife and is pregnant, when the US military team launches and attack where Josha is, exposing his cover. Maya flees with her AI family in boats, but the NOMAD explodes the ships. Five years later, Joshua is summoned by General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) and Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) to return to New Asia to destroy a new weapon called Alpha O and developed by Nirmata that may be capable to destroy NOMAD, but Joshua shows no interest. They show a video of Maya alive to convince Joshua to join the team that will be moved to destroy the weapon. He succeeds enter in the hidden compound and find a simulant that has the appearance of a girl and gives the name Alphie (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). Instead of delivering to Howell, he flees with Alphie to meet his friend and former commander Drew (Sturgill Simpson) to find what Alphie is and the whereabouts of Maya. But he is hunted down by the police and by Colonel Howell.\"The Creator\" is the most original Sci-Fi recently released by the industry. The plot has a different view of the artificial intelligence (AI), showing them as pacific machines that would like to coexist with humans; on the other hand, American government is evil and manipulative. The opposite of Terminator franchise that give a warn against the AI> Even the destruction of Los Angeles, as explained by Harun, performed by Ken Watanabe, was caused by a human coding error that the U. S. government blamed on AI. The special effects, cinematography and direction is top-notch, and deserved a better screenplay. The beginning is too abrupt and only explained in flashbacks, and the viewer begins to watch the movie without understanding the situation of Joshua and Maya. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Resistência\" (\"Resistance\")",
    "99": "The Creator. Another tale of Rogue AIs. This time they nuked LA. While the US has banned all AIs they are still welcome in New Asia where AIs, Simulants (AIs with human faces) and humans live together in harmony. The US wages war on the AIs and New Asia both by covert means and open attacks. A commando, Joehua is senr undercover in an attempt to capture Nirmata, New Asia's chief AI architect, he falls for Nirmata;s daughter Maya but remains loyal to the US. He is extracted too soon and the pregnant Maya disappears presumed dead. Five years later he is shown evidence that Maya is alive and is sent in again to destroy an ultimate weapon created by Nirmata and to recover Maya and their child. Not everything is simple though, the weapon turns out to be a Simulant child capable of physical and mental growth. Joshua now seels another path. Some interesting analogies with the Vietnam War as AIs are butchered including AI & Simulant Buddhist monks in bombing attacks and Mai Lai type massacres. An interesting examination of what it is to be Human and to be aI, differences and similarities. Some good Blade Runner influenced city scapes and concepts along with advanced weaponry, giant tanks, jet-powered Ospreys. The most impressive being Nomad, a platform which floats above the clouds, lighting up and raining death down on it;s targets. Quite a few plot twists and surprises as the narrative unfolds. A pretty good film but the influences of (rather than homages to) other films are including Terminator, BR and even Apocalypse Now are obvious, this perhaps, prevents it from being original enough to qualify as a classic. Directed by Gareth Edwards, who co-wrote the screenplay with Chris Weitz. 8.5/10.",
    "100": "This movie was a very thin social message about the oppression of minorities wrapped around poorly thought out science fiction. I don't think I've ever seen the idea of androids handled quite so poorly. The androids in this film are basically just people, they have no apparent abilities beyond human capabilities. Even the \"police\" robots are running around like buffoons, chattering in some sort of robot speak instead of communicating instantly and silently like the machines they're supposed to be. Then someone makes one that works like some sort of universal remote that can selectively turn off \"technology\" at will. How does that work? We don't have to tell you! There was literally a scene where someone took a child out of the hands of a sleeping android, wrap your head around that one. Apparently the motion sensing camera I got on Amazon is more advanced than these sophisticated androids. They also couldn't keep the scale of their massive space station consistent, but that might be asking a little much of Hollywood.John David Washington is just a colorless actor. I don't know, maybe he hasn't found the right role or the right director, but he just comes off as wooden and flat every time I see him. He brings nothing to his characters. Allison Janey was good, but her role was a cliché. The only thing they did different was have her play the character instead of someone like Ed Harris.If you want some mindless action schlock that I'm hesitant to even call science fiction, there are worse things you can watch. 5/10.",

Make no sense.May be some school kid write this script or some ones Facebook or tiktok performance may inspire them. Very dumb. Stay away.",
    "102": "The CGI and special effect of this film is on par with some of the newest technologies and combines visuals from Star Wars to District 9. However, this film suffers from a weak script that seems more focused on a political overtone than story telling.In movies such as The Terminator series and Matrix series, they focus on the inherent struggle of humanity vs machine and unravels the philosophical question of \"what is life?\"Though this film does also touch point on this theme, the protagonist began the film addressing AI as nothing more than machine and later come to terms of accepting them as some sort of life form, but much of this was lost because of the film's heaven emphasis on the nationality of the villain.For example, in the Terminator, the villain is the machines and the protagonists are simply all of humanity. In the Matrix, this is the same except if you watch it from the Animatrix prequel, it is much more sympathetic to the machine and humanity was actually the real villain, \"all of humanity.\"In The Creator, this deep philosophical argument is lost when they insist on labeling the villain \"United States,\" and thus the portrayal becomes a political overtone of preaching American imperialism, which is controversial and argumentative. Not only does this divide your audience, but it greatly diverge from the heart of your film's premise, which again is the questioning of \"what constitutes life\" and \"can AI become self-aware, sentient?\"So overall a 5/10 for me.",
    "103": "I had high hopes for Creator, a movie that promised to explore the complex relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the film falls far short of its potential, delivering a plot that is both predictable and uninspired. The AI characters are poorly developed and lack any real depth or nuance, making it difficult to care about their fate.The film's central conflict is also contrived and fails to generate any real suspense. The plot twists are telegraphed miles in advance, and the ending is unsatisfying and clichéd. Overall, Creator is a disappointing and forgettable film that wastes a promising premise.The plot of the movie was generated by a prompt to chatGPT such as: give me a plot of a movie that includes AI and will disappoint everyone.Seriously, they missed the chance of leverage the \"AI\" part. If instead of robots they had mutants, zombies, vampires, whatever.... The movie plot could still remain the same. That shows how empty is the movie.",
    "104": "It is so rare to see a big movie studio, make an original sci-fi movie with a pretty high budget. With a budget of 80 million dollars, the CGI and visuals look way better than a lot of franchise movies with 200-300 million budgets. The cinematography is stunning, the use of practical effects and sets is awesome, and the world itself is amazingly designed.The biggest problem this movie has is the whole core of it, the story and characters. The story is about another man protecting the child plot but not done as well. It's predictable while also having a lot of questionable or dumb elements. The human characters are all one-dimensional, including the main character. They don't build up the developing relationship between the main character and the kid which makes it difficult to emotionally invest in their struggles.Unfortunately, we have a studio finally taking a risk but not landing. My only hope is that this does not deter them from trying again.",
    "105": "The Creator is EVERYTHING we've been craving as film fans. Thought provoking, original concepts made by a true visionary with a complete mastery over his craft. Also the best handling of our current challenges with AI. It's so tastefully woven. Engrossing, thought provoking and visually arresting -I'm completely in love with this film.The Creator is truly something special - a masterful piece of incredibly original sci-fi! This film definitely has many influences from George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron but Gareth Edwards also managed give the film its own voice. It's one of the most fully realized sci-fi films I've ever seen, both thematically and in world building. We haven't had big, bold, original sci-fi like this in years! It's so refreshing and exhilarating to see a movie so original and creative deliver on its premise! What it lacks in depth of characters and story, it makes up in an incredible aesthetic. Mind-blowing visual effects, production design and cinematography.The highest praise I can give the visual effects of The Creator is that you just don't see them. The fidelity of integration between the live footage and CGI is so good you don't see it.I'm so impressed with what Edwards was able to pull off with this film (and all for ONLY $80mil). He's made an original sci-fi movie in a time where making original movies on this scale is next to impossible and the film delivers on so many levels! It's a must see spectacle; truly a jaw-dropping, remarkable cinematic experience. A soulful, nuanced, Lucas-like interrogation of human beliefs/biases and our insecurity in the face of something greater. Spectacle and heart to the highest order with a legendary 3rd act! Pure cinema!I can't stress enough how important it is for film fans to go out and see it this weekend. It's a masterful visual feast and an intimate examination of humanity. It's fresh, made by passionate artists. It's WHY we go to the movies!If you want more original action sci-fi films instead of endless uninspired remakes & sequels, I'm begging you:Go see The Creator in theaters.",
    "106": "I love a good science fiction film as much as the next person and I'll always give the latest releases a shot. It does however feel like it's been a while since the last great original Sci-Fi film, at least on this scale. The Creator is a film I've been looking forward to for a while and I can confidently say that it met my expectations. Gareth Edwards also seems to be a director that continues to learn from his previous films and grows as a filmmaker as he goes. From breathtaking visuals to some great storytelling, here's why I more than recommend The Creator.On a futuristic Earth, artificial intelligence is at war with the human race. Joshua (John David Washington) is ex-military and for reasons I won't get into here, he makes it his mission to find the A. I.'s weapon, which ends up being a child. This film becomes a war/road trip film between these two for a while, before huge revelations occur, sending the film in a whole new direction. The Creator kept me on the edge of my seat story-wise. Many of the actual plot points are twists themselves which is why I'm staying vague. If for nothing else, care was put into the overall story.John David Washington is an actor I've been following for years now, and he's always terrific in his roles, but something really stood out for me with this performance in particular. He brought a large range of emotions, but honestly, he was nearly outshined by young actress, Madeleine Yuna Voyles. She has never been in a film before and it really does seem like she's been doing this for quite some time now. Her range and chemistry with Washington all made this film sing. The performances all around were fantastic.As mentioned earlier, Gareth Edward's Monster got my attention when he made his feature film debut, Godzilla was solid, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was one of the better Star Wars films in recent years. Well, he has topped himself with this one in my opinion. This is easily his finest work to me. The attention to detail here with both the story and the visuals was impeccable, but that can't be stated without mentioning the jaw-dropping work done by the visual effects team. For a film with an 80 Million Dollar budget, these effects are nearly perfect. It honestly looks better than most 200 Million Dollar films out there these days.The Creator blew me away visually, the story pulled me in, and the climax actually had me in tears. If you're a Sci-Fi fan, I can't recommend this one enough. I don't sense a lot of buzz around it, which is unfortunate, because it deserves some box office returns. I really wish more audiences would take chances on original movies they haven't heard of before. This is a great film and quite literally, my only complaint with the film (and the main reason I'm not giving the film a perfect score) is the fact that a lot of story beats feel reminiscent of many other films. Other than that, it's wonderfully made and I can't wait to watch it again. The Creator now playing in theatres.",
    "107": "This is going to be a huge blockbuster, hearing the usual responses from fanboys going \"Hell, yeah, that was rad!\" not knowing a single thing about what they just watched. But it will make twice its budget and then go on to be a blockbuster, selling out all the theaters on the first weekend. Then it will disappear.What is happening is that the Director and Writer(s) are doing everything necessary to bring this inconceivable story to the screen, and adding as much CG as is possible to avoid any kind of intelligent discourse. So AI has gone so far as to take over humanity in the 2060s and so there is a Third World War of sorts to take out the AI.But in reality it is a metaphor for the US in Vietnam, where we bombed villages arbitrarily in order to eliminate the Communists and so the AI now stands in for Communists, and they infiltrate the innocent villagers just the same way as it was in the Vietnam War, and so we are re-creating 'Apocalypse, Now' in this sci-fi overblown Special Effects Extravaganza. And the fanboys are gonna love it.There's little point in dwelling on the plot points, as it is pointless to recount the number of things that don't make any sense, but who cares? We get to see lots of explosions, and things seem to be slanted against the Americans, Who are attempting to bomb the Vietnamese Communists, oops, sorry, the A. I. 'Soldiers' out of existence. Then we are coerced into accepting that the fact that the projector is throwing images on the side walls (\"Screen X\") which is another exciting innovation -- and it is hammered again over and over ad nauseam, just so that we don't forget it. So we don't get even the slightest ability to use any sort of intelligence to judge the accomplishment, just watch the fact that we can now put more bullets and killing in every frame.But Mr. Gareth Edwards is of the elite circle that now has the support of the film industry to put anything in front of us, and we willingly bow to his superior will. Thank you Master, for showing us how great your so-called vision is, and please punish us with it again.",
    "108": "Acting: 5\nCamera work: 6\nEditing: 6\nBudget: 9\nStory: 5\nTheme: 4\nPure entertainment factor: 5\nVideo quality: 8\nSpecial effects: 8\nPacing: 5\nSuspension of disbelief: 3\nNon-cringe factor: 4\nLack of flashbacks: 2Overall the movie is a dud. Just dull with bad storytelling. By the director of Rogue One (2016) and Godzilla (2014). Both movies are seen as mediocre dragging big franscises into the mud. This at least is original so it looked interesting. But original doesn't mean the movie is actually doing anything new. This one doesn't. It's cliche after cliche with the story not trying anything new or even trying anything much. There is hardly any story. The movie starts with a fight between humans and humanoid robots. We don't know who is good or evil or who to root for. We follow a human, but don't know what to think about anything. It's just a bunch of people shooting at each other and people screaming at the deaths and dangers. Yet for us viewers nothing feels emotional as we really don't care about a single person here. We don't know who we want to live or die or win or lose. So in any one of the 10 shoot-out scenes we are just watching bullets fly and people fake emotions - failing horribly with acting that is cringe.The story itself seems to be shown via small flashbacks. Just dull slow motion scenes with the lead carrying his wife on the beach. Or the lead slowly walking into the ocean. Nonsense wasting our time when we are eager to get going with the story. The movie is 30 min too long just because they keep slowing down with this flashback stuff showing nothing.Most scenes and events are also pure nonsense. As I said the movie tries nothing new, but it doesn't even try to stay logical. A helicopter has a bomb in it and instead of showing the woman with the bomb out they panic and do nothing. In the same battle the humans tell us they have a super weapon. We see the space laser kill tens of robot cops in a second. Yet in the next scene there are new cops arriving in the same location and the space laser is suddenly gone from the story - because the writers didn't want it in this specific scene to create tension. After the battle the robot kid walks up to the lead. So you'd assume the story would finally try to create a storyline and motivation. Yet the lead just tells the kid to go away. So yeah, the whole point was that the kid is important. Yet the lead, the guy we follow, is a depressed mess and doesn't care about anything. He just wants his dead girlfriend back, that's it. He doesn't care if the robots or humans win the fight. So we don't care either of course. And the movie then tries to create tension by showing a bunch of shoot-out scenes making no logical sense. Often with people standing out in the open shooting at each other. And then of course the lead can kill a full room of robots in seconds as they just stand around. I watch scene by scene making zero logical sense. Even small events make no sense and one wonders if an AI wrote and directed this movie. Or a small child. It's not even big stuff being broken. It's just that no one seems to have any goals. They are willing to die fast for nothing.We don't meet anyone and don't understand the world. Why are robots living among some humans yet are seen as evil beings trying to wipe out humanity? And then there is zero introduction of the world. We start out in a small wooden cabin on the beach. There is nothing here showing us this world. We never see a taxi, an apartment, a business, a police station, a meeting, a store, a school. I don't understand how this world works. I don't understand how the lead lives his life day to day. He's already dull with no clear plans or wishes. And with this we don't even see him live even a basic life. He's just nothing in a world of nothing. With robots walking freely yet seemingly easily wiped out in seconds in any attack. So why are humans not wiping them out right this moment if they are this easy to kill? The robots just have rifles and a few bombs. The humans have gigantic tanks, planes, lasers, bombs, rockets, robots.

Yet this is a giant military with millions if not billions of people serving them with gigantic battles each single day with villages hiding robots. Yet not a single person or spy on Earth ever asked those other humans why they were fighting for the other side? And why are all the US army people so damn evil and cruel? The movie is trying to tell us that we can't know who to support yet the actors clearly show us which side is evil. Not because of any event. Just because they act evil. That's it. The events themselves are just nonsense with nothing being explained. And this over the top acting makes it worse as cleary we know one side is evil yet not why.I adore science fiction.

    "114": "The CGI and special effect of this film is on par with some of the newest technologies and combines visuals from Star Wars to District 9. However, this film suffers from a weak script that seems more focused on a political overtone than story telling.In movies such as The Terminator series and Matrix series, they focus on the inherent struggle of humanity vs machine and unravels the philosophical question of \"what is life?\"Though this film does also touch point on this theme, the protagonist began the film addressing AI as nothing more than machine and later come to terms of accepting them as some sort of life form, but much of this was lost because of the film's heaven emphasis on the nationality of the villain.For example, in the Terminator, the villain is the machines and the protagonists are simply all of humanity. In the Matrix, this is the same except if you watch it from the Animatrix prequel, it is much more sympathetic to the machine and humanity was actually the real villain, \"all of humanity.\"In The Creator, this deep philosophical argument is lost when they insist on labeling the villain \"United States,\" and thus the portrayal becomes a political overtone of preaching American imperialism, which is controversial and argumentative. Not only does this divide your audience, but it greatly diverge from the heart of your film's premise, which again is the questioning of \"what constitutes life\" and \"can AI become self-aware, sentient?\"So overall a 5/10 for me.",
    "115": "I had high hopes for Creator, a movie that promised to explore the complex relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the film falls far short of its potential, delivering a plot that is both predictable and uninspired. The AI characters are poorly developed and lack any real depth or nuance, making it difficult to care about their fate.The film's central conflict is also contrived and fails to generate any real suspense. The plot twists are telegraphed miles in advance, and the ending is unsatisfying and clichéd. Overall, Creator is a disappointing and forgettable film that wastes a promising premise.The plot of the movie was generated by a prompt to chatGPT such as: give me a plot of a movie that includes AI and will disappoint everyone.Seriously, they missed the chance of leverage the \"AI\" part. If instead of robots they had mutants, zombies, vampires, whatever.... The movie plot could still remain the same. That shows how empty is the movie.",

With a budget of 80 million dollars, the CGI and visuals look way better than a lot of franchise movies with 200-300 million budgets. The cinematography is stunning, the use of practical effects and sets is awesome, and the world itself is amazingly designed.The biggest problem this movie has is the whole core of it, the story and characters. The story is about another man protecting the child plot but not done as well. It's predictable while also having a lot of questionable or dumb elements. The human characters are all one-dimensional, including the main character. They don't build up the developing relationship between the main character and the kid which makes it difficult to emotionally invest in their struggles.Unfortunately, we have a studio finally taking a risk but not landing. My only hope is that this does not deter them from trying again.",
    "117": "The Creator is EVERYTHING we've been craving as film fans. Thought provoking, original concepts made by a true visionary with a complete mastery over his craft. Also the best handling of our current challenges with AI. It's so tastefully woven. Engrossing, thought provoking and visually arresting -I'm completely in love with this film.The Creator is truly something special - a masterful piece of incredibly original sci-fi! This film definitely has many influences from George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron but Gareth Edwards also managed give the film its own voice. It's one of the most fully realized sci-fi films I've ever seen, both thematically and in world building. We haven't had big, bold, original sci-fi like this in years! It's so refreshing and exhilarating to see a movie so original and creative deliver on its premise! What it lacks in depth of characters and story, it makes up in an incredible aesthetic. Mind-blowing visual effects, production design and cinematography.The highest praise I can give the visual effects of The Creator is that you just don't see them. The fidelity of integration between the live footage and CGI is so good you don't see it.I'm so impressed with what Edwards was able to pull off with this film (and all for ONLY $80mil). He's made an original sci-fi movie in a time where making original movies on this scale is next to impossible and the film delivers on so many levels! It's a must see spectacle; truly a jaw-dropping, remarkable cinematic experience. A soulful, nuanced, Lucas-like interrogation of human beliefs/biases and our insecurity in the face of something greater. Spectacle and heart to the highest order with a legendary 3rd act! Pure cinema!I can't stress enough how important it is for film fans to go out and see it this weekend. It's a masterful visual feast and an intimate examination of humanity. It's fresh, made by passionate artists. It's WHY we go to the movies!If you want more original action sci-fi films instead of endless uninspired remakes & sequels, I'm begging you:Go see The Creator in theaters.",
    "118": "I love a good science fiction film as much as the next person and I'll always give the latest releases a shot. It does however feel like it's been a while since the last great original Sci-Fi film, at least on this scale. The Creator is a film I've been looking forward to for a while and I can confidently say that it met my expectations. Gareth Edwards also seems to be a director that continues to learn from his previous films and grows as a filmmaker as he goes. From breathtaking visuals to some great storytelling, here's why I more than recommend The Creator.On a futuristic Earth, artificial intelligence is at war with the human race. Joshua (John David Washington) is ex-military and for reasons I won't get into here, he makes it his mission to find the A. I.'s weapon, which ends up being a child. This film becomes a war/road trip film between these two for a while, before huge revelations occur, sending the film in a whole new direction. The Creator kept me on the edge of my seat story-wise. Many of the actual plot points are twists themselves which is why I'm staying vague. If for nothing else, care was put into the overall story.John David Washington is an actor I've been following for years now, and he's always terrific in his roles, but something really stood out for me with this performance in particular. He brought a large range of emotions, but honestly, he was nearly outshined by young actress, Madeleine Yuna Voyles. She has never been in a film before and it really does seem like she's been doing this for quite some time now. Her range and chemistry with Washington all made this film sing. The performances all around were fantastic.As mentioned earlier, Gareth Edward's Monster got my attention when he made his feature film debut, Godzilla was solid, and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story was one of the better Star Wars films in recent years. Well, he has topped himself with this one in my opinion. This is easily his finest work to me. The attention to detail here with both the story and the visuals was impeccable, but that can't be stated without mentioning the jaw-dropping work done by the visual effects team. For a film with an 80 Million Dollar budget, these effects are nearly perfect. It honestly looks better than most 200 Million Dollar films out there these days.The Creator blew me away visually, the story pulled me in, and the climax actually had me in tears. If you're a Sci-Fi fan, I can't recommend this one enough. I don't sense a lot of buzz around it, which is unfortunate, because it deserves some box office returns. I really wish more audiences would take chances on original movies they haven't heard of before. This is a great film and quite literally, my only complaint with the film (and the main reason I'm not giving the film a perfect score) is the fact that a lot of story beats feel reminiscent of many other films. Other than that, it's wonderfully made and I can't wait to watch it again. The Creator now playing in theatres.",
    "119": "This is going to be a huge blockbuster, hearing the usual responses from fanboys going \"Hell, yeah, that was rad!\" not knowing a single thing about what they just watched. But it will make twice its budget and then go on to be a blockbuster, selling out all the theaters on the first weekend. Then it will disappear.What is happening is that the Director and Writer(s) are doing everything necessary to bring this inconceivable story to the screen, and adding as much CG as is possible to avoid any kind of intelligent discourse. So AI has gone so far as to take over humanity in the 2060s and so there is a Third World War of sorts to take out the AI.But in reality it is a metaphor for the US in Vietnam, where we bombed villages arbitrarily in order to eliminate the Communists and so the AI now stands in for Communists, and they infiltrate the innocent villagers just the same way as it was in the Vietnam War, and so we are re-creating 'Apocalypse, Now' in this sci-fi overblown Special Effects Extravaganza. And the fanboys are gonna love it.There's little point in dwelling on the plot points, as it is pointless to recount the number of things that don't make any sense, but who cares? We get to see lots of explosions, and things seem to be slanted against the Americans, Who are attempting to bomb the Vietnamese Communists, oops, sorry, the A. I. 'Soldiers' out of existence. Then we are coerced into accepting that the fact that the projector is throwing images on the side walls (\"Screen X\") which is another exciting innovation -- and it is hammered again over and over ad nauseam, just so that we don't forget it. So we don't get even the slightest ability to use any sort of intelligence to judge the accomplishment, just watch the fact that we can now put more bullets and killing in every frame.But Mr. Gareth Edwards is of the elite circle that now has the support of the film industry to put anything in front of us, and we willingly bow to his superior will. Thank you Master, for showing us how great your so-called vision is, and please punish us with it again.",

Just dull with bad storytelling. By the director of Rogue One (2016) and Godzilla (2014). Both movies are seen as mediocre dragging big franscises into the mud. This at least is original so it looked interesting. But original doesn't mean the movie is actually doing anything new. This one doesn't. It's cliche after cliche with the story not trying anything new or even trying anything much. There is hardly any story. The movie starts with a fight between humans and humanoid robots. We don't know who is good or evil or who to root for. We follow a human, but don't know what to think about anything. It's just a bunch of people shooting at each other and people screaming at the deaths and dangers. Yet for us viewers nothing feels emotional as we really don't care about a single person here. We don't know who we want to live or die or win or lose. So in any one of the 10 shoot-out scenes we are just watching bullets fly and people fake emotions - failing horribly with acting that is cringe.The story itself seems to be shown via small flashbacks. Just dull slow motion scenes with the lead carrying his wife on the beach. Or the lead slowly walking into the ocean. Nonsense wasting our time when we are eager to get going with the story. The movie is 30 min too long just because they keep slowing down with this flashback stuff showing nothing.Most scenes and events are also pure nonsense. As I said the movie tries nothing new, but it doesn't even try to stay logical. A helicopter has a bomb in it and instead of showing the woman with the bomb out they panic and do nothing. In the same battle the humans tell us they have a super weapon. We see the space laser kill tens of robot cops in a second. Yet in the next scene there are new cops arriving in the same location and the space laser is suddenly gone from the story - because the writers didn't want it in this specific scene to create tension. After the battle the robot kid walks up to the lead. So you'd assume the story would finally try to create a storyline and motivation. Yet the lead just tells the kid to go away. So yeah, the whole point was that the kid is important. Yet the lead, the guy we follow, is a depressed mess and doesn't care about anything. He just wants his dead girlfriend back, that's it. He doesn't care if the robots or humans win the fight. So we don't care either of course. And the movie then tries to create tension by showing a bunch of shoot-out scenes making no logical sense. Often with people standing out in the open shooting at each other. And then of course the lead can kill a full room of robots in seconds as they just stand around. I watch scene by scene making zero logical sense. Even small events make no sense and one wonders if an AI wrote and directed this movie. Or a small child. It's not even big stuff being broken. It's just that no one seems to have any goals. They are willing to die fast for nothing.We don't meet anyone and don't understand the world. Why are robots living among some humans yet are seen as evil beings trying to wipe out humanity? And then there is zero introduction of the world. We start out in a small wooden cabin on the beach. There is nothing here showing us this world. We never see a taxi, an apartment, a business, a police station, a meeting, a store, a school. I don't understand how this world works. I don't understand how the lead lives his life day to day. He's already dull with no clear plans or wishes. And with this we don't even see him live even a basic life. He's just nothing in a world of nothing. With robots walking freely yet seemingly easily wiped out in seconds in any attack. So why are humans not wiping them out right this moment if they are this easy to kill? The robots just have rifles and a few bombs. The humans have gigantic tanks, planes, lasers, bombs, rockets, robots. All battles are extremely one-sided so the whole \"robots may wipe us out\" idea presented at the beginning is pure nonsense the writer/director put in there to try to imitate other movies that show this scenario without making it coherent with the story he tells here. There are scenes where the US army meets humans that hide robots and robot bases and instead of trying to find out why half the humans on Earth work with the robots in the war they just scream at them. \"Why are you working with robots!\".
