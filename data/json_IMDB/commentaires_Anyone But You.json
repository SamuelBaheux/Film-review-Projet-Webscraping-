    "0": "I really enjoyed the interplay between Glenn Powell and Sydney Sweeney; these characters breathed life into this short but fun romcom. This film had spectacular scenery in Sydney Australia. This is not such a cookie cutter movie that it felt like every other romcom; I set it's own path throughout the film. Sydney Sweeney did a great job as a single undecided adult finding her way. Glenn Powell Provided a point of view of wanting transparency between the characters. It would be fun to see these actors in another film together again. The chemistry between these characters made the movie fun to watch.",
