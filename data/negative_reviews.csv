Interstellar,"You would think the story is adventurous, exciting, beautiful! Its not at all what I had hoped. It is slow, dark as a black hole, loud as an old Barton Theater Organ playing Fugue in D Minor interesting as a litter box. The story is thin.....I can't blame the actors, the entire plot is pretty simple. Can't inhabit earth, find somewhere else to live. Interstellar is a repeat of time continuum stories you have heard or seen before, I wont spoil it, but it's all been told before. Dialog is dreary, slow, ponderous. The comparison to 2001 is preposterous. The wonder and awe of 2001 and other movies before it was it had never been done it was the first. 2001 was all done without the advanced technology we have in computer imagery we have today. 2001 was a pioneering effort. This is not at all pioneering, inventive or surprising if you read science fiction at all. The imagery is not all that unique or impressive. The constant thumping and droning of background music was mind numbing. Most of the show I was trying to nod off, but for the LOUD THEATER ORGAN playing in the background I probably would have. I have to agree with some of the reviewers who thought the whole show was ridiculous and in some ways they are right. Somehow science has advanced enough to create interstellar space travel but not far enough to build power cells, clean power, they are still burning fossil fuels. The robots are Lego like, silly looking clunks of stainless steel....it is all so ridiculous. I would not call this HORRIBLE or AWFUL I have seen some real stinkers over the years. Interstellar is not so ridiculous it is a parody of a good movie it is just not a great movie some had hoped it to be.","would think story adventurous , exciting , beautiful ! hoped . slow , dark black hole , loud old Barton Theater Organ playing Fugue Minor interesting litter box . story thin ... ..I ca n't blame actors , entire plot pretty simple .

Interstellar,"First, about the pain, which is mostly due to the sound. I don't know how many times we're in a rocket ship blasting off somewhere with everything shaking, the cameras jiggling, the astronauts grimacing, and the sound track roaring, screeching, thundering, blasting the eardrums—I really did have to plug my ears by the end of the movie. Add to that the so- called music, which consisted mostly of even higher mountains of noise, mostly produced by a big pipe organ pumping out its gargantuan decibels in the form of a few simple chords—hardly music, merely a musical instrument adding to the overall accumulation of noise. I don't think anybody should be credited with creating ""music"" for this film.As for the stupidity, I was lured into the theatre by publicity claiming that the film had got the science right, or at least the graphic representation of a wormhole and black hole.

For the general audience (obviously, the audience the film was aimed at), the science talk came across as sheer gobbledygook. There was no effort to explain the ideas for the public.

Interstellar,"I resent its cynically shallow pessimism disguised as apple pie sentimentalism, its artistic laziness & its technical sloppiness. I resent its condescending attitude towards its audience. By virtue of its sheer popularity on IMDb it's a testament to the colossal, continuing dumbing down of movie audiences.Where to start on specifics? The premise of a world-wide drought (a major blooper mentioned on this site) with tall green stalks of healthy looking corn. Okra grown as a major food crop (or was that supposed to be a joke)? Cut & paste interviews from a Ken Burns documentary abut the real dust bowl. The tiresome cheapie ""homages"" to Kubrick's 2001. The pedantic Astrophysics for Dummies lectures.The soap opera characters. The one dimensional acting. The utter predictability of every single plot twist. I'd get more specific, but then I'd be blacklisted for including spoilers. You want to see imaginative mind-blowing science-fiction/fantasy film making? Let me make 2 suggestions: Stalker and Solaris. Both Russian films directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Far lower budgets than Hollywood blockbusters but works of pure genius. Avoid the American version of Solaris. It's a travesty, though not quite as awful as Interstellar.

Interstellar,"This movie had such an expansive amount of hype behind it...how could anything go wrong?!(Cue the Blair Witch Project soundtrack...)By no means was this was the worst movie that I have ever seen, that's definitive; there were, however, a few things about the film that don't make much sense! Perhaps the most obvious among them was WTF was Mann trying to accomplish in his apparent death spiral desire to condemn all life on Earth?! He knew that the mathematics behind 'Plan A' was a fraud; so, he...obviously...believed that returning to Earth was no option. This means that it was his understanding that finding a planet suitable for life, from 'an Earth perspective', was the only viable option. Yet, he knew\believed that the ice planet that he landed on was not suitable for life, faking the data. So, why fake the data?? Would doing so enhance the likelihood of him being rescued? Presumably, yes, since he was transmitting the fake favorable data in hopes that someone would arrive & save him. Yet, he prevented them from doing anything on his world...obviously...because he knew they would uncover his deception. So, given that, what was the plan!? To condemn all life on Earth?! Granted, maybe that's the whole point of that story arc; he was insane. Which is, I believe, rather ironic; that 'death spiral', specifically due to the action of that scene, was, I think, the best scene in the entire film.Something overlooked by, at least, virtually everyone that saw this film, no doubt about it, is: Did the scientists on Earth see the blackhole, ""Gargantuan"", on the Earth-side of the wormhole, obviously, 'before' sending the astronauts through the wormhole, including the 12 sent through initially? It is implied that they did; but, ..& someone, please, correct me if I am wrong, ..no where throughout the first hour, or so, of the film did they bother to mention that blackhole that's on the other side of the wormhole, in that 'galaxy far, far away...' They talked about the 'wormhole'; not the blackhole! If they knew about the blackhole early enough, this, reasonably, may have changed their game-plan. Further, why go down to that planet, in orbit around the blackhole, when the risk of failure is so high, let alone actually retrieving data that is worth the risk of going down to that planet is so excruciatingly, 'astronomically' and exponentially low¿? Especially given the reality that said planet is completely inhospitable...given its close proximity to a blackhole¡!¡ For cryin' out loud, they'd be better off sending down a probe, at least at first, on the same quicker trajectory that they took to get to the planet, to determine if the data can be retrieved; & the data could reasonably be retrieved with just a probe, anyway! And if the time dilation makes all of that not viable, then, it is damn sure not worth sending people down there! It is a story arc that, in theory, sounds great 'script-wise'; because, it adds emotional turmoil for the characters to go through & experience &, therefore, tension & drama for the viewer - yet, it just doesn't honestly work. You see this as a person just watching the movie.I actually feel sorry for Getty, from ""That 70's Show""; while the character is not useless, it is a weak character, entirely because of how the character was introduced, & Topher Grace, as an accomplished actor, deserves better than that. It actually made sense for that character to be a doctor working for/at NASA/NORAD, at the compound, perhaps as the physician working directly with Professor Brand...File that under "" *Duh!* ""; seriously, put that into the '"" *Duh!* "" File'!Obviously, this was a much better way to introduce that character. And, obviously, they chose to not do this; they introduced the character in, pretty much, the worst way possible; dropping him in out of no where, like he fell out of the sky - literally, ..as an after-thought! This was an absolute hatchet job and, undeniably, is the worst thing about the entire film. And, of course, there's the gratuitously predictable 'Tom', a character as devoid of a legitimate reason to exist as any such character has ever existed in the history of cinema! I am actually surprised that they didn't make him an addict of some sort; why not just poor on the vulgar borishness like it's pancake syrup!¿?!And, finally, (astronaut) Brand had a much greater chance of getting back to ""Sol""/""Terra"", our Solar System, than Cooper 'the guy who fell into a black hole...'... But, they can't allow the hero to FAIL; so, they have them accomplish the completely impossible. And the 'Tesseract Scene' is awesome; it looks very cool. However, it only made sense in a 'goofy romanticized sort of way', i.e., 'script-wise', that Cooper was 'the ghost' who started it all... And although there may have been no truly good way, at least none that they were able to think of (Although, did they even try!?), to depict it cinematically, I would love to have seen something of the 5th Dimension beings who made it all possible. When Cooper said that 'we' were them, i.e., ""...they're not beings, they're us."", i.e., that humans are the 5th Dimension beings, that's just more romanticized BS.Overall, the worst thing about this movie is the directing, by far! This movie actually made me lose some degree of respect for Christopher Nolan.","movie expansive amount hype behind ... could anything go wrong ? !

Interstellar,"I sent to see Interstellar on Saturday night and have just spent 45 incredulous minutes reading the reviews. The film I went to see was dull, preposterous and far far far too long. Let's start with the idea. A good one but poorly displayed. I wanted to know more about how humanity was destroying the planet. All I got was old folk I am guessing talking about the duststorms of the 1920's and 1930's? Perhaps they were attempting to lay the foundation for the whole premise of the film? I also wanted to know more about Cooper but we didn't really see how he became a farmer other than the flashback at the start. When did his wife die? Why is his father in law living with him? Did we really get to understand the relevance of the droid they chased in the truck? Unfortunately most of the film is taken up with barely audible dialogue about scientific hypothesis and personal issues intertwined together. This made it very difficult to follow and the interest wanes as a result. BUT the biggest downfall of the film is Matt Damon. I am a fan off his but not in this. He is dreadfully miscast as the villain of the piece of sorts and that whole fight with Cooper and Ryan is poor. It is just not convincing at all and there is no suspense involved in the whole docking scene at all. Cooper just tells him not to dock as he hasn't got the codes but you never felt Ryan was in jeopardy. It was so poorly constructed. Overall vey similar to Inception in that it is at times visually stunning but rather like Inception it is style over substance. Beautiful to look at but like opening a strawberry cream in a box of Quality Street - very disappointing. And the title of my review? I am just a bit fed up that Nolan has made some fine early films and now nobody will criticise him? In The Emperors New Clothes nobody tells the Emperor he is wearing nothing until a little boy informs him. Somebody needs to tell Nolan that he needs to get back to crafting films full of suspense and not a plodding sci-fi full of characters you barely care about.","sent see Interstellar Saturday night spent 45 incredulous minutes reading reviews . film went see dull , preposterous far far far long .

Interstellar,"As you can probably ascertain from my title sentence, I am not a fan of Mr Nolan. However I don't have any bias prior to watching his films, in fact quite the opposite, I want to like his films, as I really like his ideas and concepts, which is why it's such a shame he never delivers.I also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal, certainly if you look at money they make, but so far, they have all left me cold.Interstellar, TDK and Inception all have similar flaws: On the positive side, they are all really cinematic, stylish and well filmed. They all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects.On the negative side, the plots are terrible and make no sense. The dialog is flat and unrealistic, there is no charisma or charm in the films, they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning. The characters tend to be robotic and cold, not warm or humorous.The problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen, but ultimately nothing does, so it becomes a major let down.On to Interstellar specifically (warning spoilers a plenty): The first hour of the film, was very boring, and very silly. The Earth is running out of food, so people still plant huge fields of crops, which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason. They have completely automated the process of farming crops, yet they don't need Scientists or Engineers, they need farmers, which makes no sense.If the Earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off, taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process. Scientists and Engineers would be the most valued members of society. If the crops were so valuable they wouldn't be exposed to the elements and the dust. They would be covered and protected. Everyone is so worried about the food shortages, they don't take any notice of it. Instead they drive around in huge petrol driven SUV's from 2014 (where's the Google cars or electric cars?).Here's an idea. You now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships, so apply that to the population of Earth and reduce the need for food. Anyway let's move on.They go into space, arrive at some place and immediately land in some water. Do they survey the area first, check out the planet and landing area first in detail, nope they just land. Now I know there is time pressure, but why haven't NASA sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information.Anyway this drags on a bit, they visit another place, which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film (only after about 2 and a half hours). Cooper flies into a black hole, where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly, but survives in some kind of advanced framework, where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter. After this there is a very silly ending. Even though he is outside of time, as it were and he can send messages to any point, he can't for some reason stay in the same time as his daughterAnd how stupid was the 1970's Minecraft designed robot.In the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great, but the plot, soul and charm of the film was completely missing, unfortunately like all Nolan movies.","probably ascertain title sentence , fan Mr Nolan .

Interstellar,"SPOILER FREE BEGINS *********I had a sneaking feeling that Christopher Nolan was a director who wasn't particularly good at staging emotional sequences, nor had a special skill in staging action sequences nor has consistency in his screen writing which may range from mediocre (The Dark Knight Rises and overall logical setup of the Batman series) or sublime (Memento, Inception). What always worked for Nolan was that his movies were always interesting and always intriguing and if the script was any good, he made classics.Interstellar represents a colossal failure of Nolan on every front imaginable. Let's start with the plot which is the most looked forward thing in his movies. The plot involving the World's end and the attempt to save it via Interstellar travel is so hokey that you may think you are watching a Michael Bay movie. If you could complain about ""Gravity""s leaps of logic, then you will realize there is absolutely no physical logic in this script. The story is a Galaxy sized plot hole. The sad part is that it isn't even original which you would come to expect from the Nolan Brothers. It's a bad mishmash of Gravity, Coherence, 2001 a Space Odyssey and Contact book ended by a cringe inducing emotional thread that it will compel you to flay your hands in the air over the inept acting, dialogues, staging, and poor editing, story and what not. If you were expecting an ""Inception"" than don't, Interstellar has the most contrived sci- fi plot in existence coupled with bad acting. It's Armageddon with a sense of higher purpose. At least I enjoyed Armageddon.SPOILER FREE ENDS ********Now back to the plot points. Lets talk about the plot. The world is ending, and I could not fathom why, nor could Nolan show us the World in a broad sense apart from one single corn field farm in the middle of nowhere which conveniently houses an ultra secret project by NASA. If the world is ending, who will save it? Of course the ""Aliens"" or ""They"" (insert oooooooooooh). I thought the movie would involve humans discovering Interstellar travel.I never went into the movie thinking that a huge big ass Worm Hole was conveniently placed by 5- Dimensional unexplained aliens as a convenient plot device to jump into the whole space travel thingy. How hokey is that? And the hokum continues with supremely bad exposition ever committed on screen with fellow astronauts explaining how worm holes work (""Ah it's shaped like a sphere!) or how time dilation works in relativity theory. It seems like none of Johnathan or Christopher could truly grasp how these concepts should work in the context of the film and hence these appear as contrived elements in the service of producing cheap thrills (""oh we lost so many years"").And talking about cheap thrills, can anyone possibly out there condone how stupid the middle reveal was with our famous cameo from a famous actor? Okay let's talk about the ending. One can apparently fly into a black hole, make contact with 5-Dimensional entities who will present you a menu of quantum states of possibilities in order to save the world by how? How? By transmitting some mumbo-jumbo data via Morse Code through a ticking hand of a watch to a woman on the other side of the space time continuum so that she can umm fit it into the equation? or was it a constant? what is a 5 pager formula? How did it work? Hokey as hell.And the visuals? Oh the problem is since Gravity came out and took the crown of the best space visuals in the last 5 years, what could Instellar do? Well lets have some obviously fake looking CGI dust clouds. Have your space ship fly over a Windows wallpaper of Saturn. How was any of it ""Original""? Let's look at the planet. One has Water with a fake wall of waves, one has simply ice. That's it. Water and Ice. Where did you spend your money on Mr Nolan? Oh the Robots were hilarious but you would cringe in your seats thinking how a rectangular block of moving pillar was a good Robot Design and how the poor chap was managing to run on flat ground.And the acting?

Interstellar,"Although the idea is simple and written 100 times in SF novels and short stories, it could make a quite good space opera. It could be deep and wise. It could make people think. But no. It had to be wasted. The weakest point is not poor acting (by the way: McConaughey really can't speak? I am not the best in the world in English, but I know many native speakers who couldn't understand him talking), awful music. Even the dumbest possible design of a robot is not the worst part of the movie. It is a forced, painful solemness and pretended adherence to science and logic combined with funny, childish errors and a mile wide gaps in logic.It would take to much time and space to write down all stupid ideas, so just a few of them. Some of them are partially explained in the movie or e.g. in IMDb FAQ, but the explanations are even more naive than the goofs themselves. I start with a biggest problem: - In R. E. Raspe's ""Baron Munchausen"", the baron drowns in the mud and saves his life by pulling himself out, on his own hair. The Earthmen in the movie do the same: the humans from the future save their ancestors. But if the present people perish, there are no future people to save them... The most simple paradox, and yet they included it in the ""serious"" movie. And no naive explanations (branches, interpretations, non-linear timelines etc) can make it wiser, no matter how many times they use the word ""fractal"". And if the future people exist, they don't need to do anything, do they? - The best plan from the future humans is to put (in a past) a wormhole, 2 years flight from Earth, making it almost impossible to find and reach. Then the Earthmen would have to build spaceships for billions of people to travel to a new world. I would simply help the Earthmen get a decent crops...A catastrophic climate change destroys all the crops. How? During just several years? And all plants are dead? All animals? But humans survived? How? Isn't it possible e.g. to grow some algae in oceans? Why nobody even tries to do anything? - Why an anti-science education? A science never does any harm. Only the politics and businessmen do, using science. So it is not the science to be ostracized.A farmer drives his children to anti-science school fully equipped to bring a military drone down (has a specially programmed computer, antennas, means to establish a connection, etc.) - A ""ghost"" communication is very implausible. Does it really depend on gravity? Even some waves, oscillations would create observed effects on books/dust, the gravity hardly could.Barely legal NASA base, hidden in a barn, building a spaceship... Funny. Unsuccessfully looking for it's best pilot in the world, year after year... Funny. The pilot accidentally finds them, and is captured and interrogated like a war prisoner by scientists - funny. The scientists are pilot's old friends. And they just finished building a rocket. He has never seen this ship, he is a farmer for 20 years now, so will he fly it, the only hope for humanity, please? FUNNY! - Plan A and B. Science and technology so advanced that can keep human embryos alive during a space journey, and rise them to get humans, can not rise a radish on Earth (nor perform a MRI scan).Please, stop the stupid ""expert's presentation how it works"" (the imbecile with a pencil demonstrating wormholes, just like the similar imbecile in ""The Martian"" explaining the trivial maneuver around Earth). What makes it even more pathetic, the ""expert"" addresses his childish show to a engineer and best NASA pilot....and so on... I don't understand the physics that stands beside the unusual phenomena in the alien solar system, on its planets (the hundred miles high waves on an ocean two feet deep, the frozen, solid clouds in the air, the anti-logic movements of the ships, the anti-logic decisions of the crew... and so on...and at the end I (and all the nearby watchers) couldn't believe the stupidity of the falling to the black hole behind the main character daughter's bookshelves. It was... it was... unspoken. And the Future Men felt that the best way of communication with Present People is to shake the books in some girls' bedroom. If you can move the book, or a hand of the watch - that means, you can move objects - you can take a pen and write as well. It is the same action, using the same forces. Yes, I fully understand the meanings, metaphors, 11 dimensions of continuum, and so on. Doesn't help.To sum up: Interstellar is just another pseudoscience-fiction movie. It is intended to be deep and serious, but is just funny (including it's makers argumentation why it is not). It is not easy to think out a GOOD SF story. You can easily make a non-science fiction story which is very good and nice to read or watch (like Star Wars), but it cannot pretend it is serious and science-based. The most depressing thing about that movie is, however, it's huge overrating on IMDb. Are the young people so easy to control? If they see something that makes the first impression of having some value (slow, grave, pseudo-intellectual) they give 9 and 10 points just to show they are serious and deep-thinking? Is that why poor SF movies get such a high notes? Passengers, the last few Aliens and so on?My ""4"" rating is a real one, not lowered to balance the general overrating.","Although idea simple written 100 times SF novels short stories , could make quite good space opera . could deep wise . could make people think . . wasted . weakest point poor acting ( way : McConaughey really ca n't speak ? best world English , know many native speakers could n't understand talking ) , awful music .

Interstellar,"Firstly, I quite like the movie in terms of visuals and the sound track. About 10 minutes in though, I find myself wishing for sub-titles as the actors' voices are inaudible. (I like MM but where is Clooney when we need him?) Now, the story idea is not half bad except Nolan misunderstood the meaning of Sci-Fi...the fiction part of 'Science Fiction' refers to the science portion of a narrative, not the human story. Leaps of faith can be justified with stretching science, especially in areas not fully understood/known by people. The human part of the story has to be true for the audience to relate to (unless there is a setting in the story for human evolution that makes them different to what we are now.) Too many illogical human behaviours are just strung together to move this along and I believe Nolan hoped that the great visuals will distract us from thinking about what is going on. I will highlight a few that ruined the movie for me, even though plenty more were present. Watch out...spoilers below!1)Murph had experienced the 'ghost' from a young age yet didn't know who it might be; yet, when we find out that the 'ghost' is Cooper, she suddenly comes to the same realisation?!? That is of course essential to the story or otherwise she will not take what he transmits seriously, yet there is no reason for her to link the 'ghost' to her father. He could have easily added a message of 'This is your dad' to her, but he never did; and even if he had, it wouldn't work with the younger Murph...if he had located the older Murph (when she was retrieving her stuff), then maybe it will make more sense...very lazy story telling here as it could have been easy to add (maybe 20 seconds of screen time?). This one thing is key to the later part of the movie and without it; the movie couldn't go along the lines it did.2)Assuming we accept that Tor and Cooper did work out the mystery of the black hole that relates to their calculation and he transmitted all the data through her watch. Even if she did figure out that it's a message from her dad (or from someone important), she wasn't paying attention to the message. It is like tuning in to a radio talk show (on serious maths no less) mid-way through a program, there is no way for her to decipher the full message if she missed the first large chunk of what was sent.3)He knew that the message 'Stay' wouldn't work to keep him on the ground. Shouldn't he try a different message? Of course, that would change history and likely Nolan didn't want to go near this paradox...but this is Sci-Fi and I'd welcome the debate that would bring...instead, he rehashes the same old, knowing it wouldn't work.4)Young Murph was understandably upset with her dad when he left...but she becomes part of mission control? Hang on...she has firsthand knowledge of what her father is up to... she knows about plan A, Plan B and the importance of the mission...yet, she wouldn't send him a message? If she became someone outside the scientific field, I can at least accept her continued anger, but putting her in mission control makes it unacceptable. (She should at least be so upset that she wants no part of a mission control which sent her dad away. Otherwise, she should understand why he had to go. ) 5) Murph has a space station named after her so she has some cloud on 'her' space station. When she suggested that Coop goes to Brand, she could help with getting him a spacecraft. Instead, he had to steal one...really? Security is not a concern in the future? A guy who has been out of the loop for almost a century just walks into and starts up a craft, knows all the correct codes to open air locks and even the way out?? (Maybe unlike now, aerospace technology does not improve in a century?) The above really killed the movie for me.Sidenotes:A) If according to their plan, skimming just outside the gravity field to go into the water planet quickly, they surely didn't spend 3+ hours there. How did it translate to 23 years? (Well, I spent almost 3 hours watching this nonsense, so maybe it is possible. Not in the way it was shown though.) B) If all of Cooper's electronics failed on entering the black hole, how did TOR survive? TOR is fully electronics! Poor story telling as this could be explained under sci-fi rules yet wasn't done.C) Why would Murph travel 2 years to the space station, with all her family in tow, to visit her father...yet on seeing him, sends him away?D) Dr Mann and Cooper walked to the edge of the cliff...yet Brand takes a few minutes on a spacecraft to reach there? She took so long that Dr Mann had the time to WALK back to the station to board the other spacecraft, before they FLY back. Ridiculous! (Nolan, this is not a commercial flight... flying cannot be so much slower than walking by any stretch of the imagination.) Overall, without a logical human story, Interstellar is just a decent visual and sound show...its almost 3 hours play time is too long when audience is not absorbed into the tale.I gave it a 5 because I did enjoy some part of the movie (the effects and sound), otherwise, it would get a 3.5 out of 10. Almost 3 hours in a cinema is way too much for this lazily told story. (Plus, there's a chance you'll age 23 years.) I sure wouldn't watch it again.","Firstly , quite like movie terms visuals sound track . 10 minutes though , find wishing sub-titles actors ' voices inaudible .

Interstellar,"Hollywood science fiction spectacles about antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds to occupy not only Earth, but also to oust us have been popular with moviegoers. Typically, like the European explorers who invaded and disenfranchised millions in the Western Hemisphere during the 15th century, these extraterrestrials—either bug-eyed behemoths with lobster claws or pod people whose seeds have drifted across the cosmos—show up to evict or absorb us. ""Inception"" director Christopher Nolan's latest extravaganza ""Interstellar,"" toplining Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow, is a superior space opera that reverses the action. Earthlings must abandon mother Earth because an environmental blight has devastated farming and millions have starved to death in overpopulated continents. No, ""Interstellar"" doesn't pit Earth against multi-colored ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" aliens or immaculate looking storm troopers in white outfits from the ""Star Wars"" and ""Hunger Games"" franchises. Instead, the ""Interstellar"" scientist heroes must search for a new home for humankind. Rather than an outlandish adventure epic with evil extraterrestrials, ""Interstellar"" qualifies as an intelligent, realistic, sometimes provocative, sci-fi saga similar to Stanley Kubrick's landmark movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Mind you, Nolan doesn't chronicle mankind's evolution from the dawn of time the way Kubrick did in as ""2001."" The casts of ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" differ, too. Kubrick relied on an unknown cast, while ""Interstellar"" boasts a charismatic array of superstars. If you haven't seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" you won't appreciate some of the clever allusions to the legendary 1968 film. Anybody who has seen ""2001"" will be amused by a joke that a robot makes about blowing an astronaut out of an airlock. Ultimately, the most obvious ""2001"" references in ""Interstellar"" are those bizarre, oblong, Minecraft-style robots that resemble the black monoliths in Kubrick's film. Some of the sci-fi terminology may fly over your head, but Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan concern themselves with more than speculative science fiction ideas. They focus on relevant contemporary themes, such as father & daughter relationships and the environment. They forge interesting characters with philosophical dialogue that you will ponder long after the movie. ""Interstellar"" occurs in the late 21st century, after things have waxed really wretched. Bad enough that farmers can grow only corn. Blight has destroyed wheat and okra. Public opinion about NASA has curdled. History textbooks have been rewritten. Everybody believes NASA faked the Apollo moon landings to bankrupt the Soviet Union. A former NASA test pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey of ""Mud""), has turned to farming and reaped rewards where many others have failed. Although his wife died from a brain cyst that an MRI could have detected had an MRI had been available, Cooper perseveres as a farmer and a father of two children, his fifteen-year old son Tom (Timothée Chalamet of ""Worse Friends""), and his precious ten-year old daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy of ""The Conjuring"") who adore him. Cooper and his kids live with his father-in-law, Donald (John Lithgow of ""Terms of Endearment""), and they contend with tumultuous dust storms on a daily basis. These dust storms recall the Depression Era drought and dust storms of that prompted millions to flee from the plains states. Dust gets into everything, and Donald wages a never-ending war to keep everything clean. Meanwhile, books have been toppling randomly from Murph's bedroom bookcase. She suspects a ghost is responsible, but nothing ghoulish like ""Paranormal Activity."" Naturally, Cooper dismisses the presence of ghosts. One day after a particularly turbulent dust storm, father and daughter examine the way the books have fallen out of the shelves, translate it into code, and come up with coordinates that lead them to a classified NORAD facility. A monolithic robot named Tars confronts them. Later, Murph and Cooper find themselves sitting around a table talking with high-ranking NASA officials. One of them is Professor Brand (Michael Caine of ""Batman Begins""), and Brand confides in Cooper that the world is living on borrowed time. Moreover, he tells him about the 'Lazarus' project. NASA has dispatched manned missions to other parts of the galaxy to find a new home for mankind. He convinces Cooper to sign on as a pilot for one last launch that will take his daughter, biologist Amelia (Oscar winning actress Anne Hathaway of ""Les Misérables); physicist Romilly (David Gyasi); geographer Doyle (Wes Bentley of ""The Hunger Games""); and two robots TARS (voice of Bill Irwin) and CASE (voice of Josh Stewart) deep into space to a recently discovered wormhole which will enable them to explore new worlds. Predictably, Murph isn't happy about her father's departure. During their flight to the wormhole, Cooper and company lose contact with Earth, but Professor Brand can still transmit messages. Gradually, however, things take a turn for the worst. The final quarter hour of ""Interstellar"" will absolutely boggle your mind. Cooper goes where no man has gone before in a desperate bid to save mankind! ""Interstellar"" is a serious sci-fi movie. The computer-generated visual effects are nothing short of dazzling, and Nolan orchestrates the flight sequences so we don't hear any sounds in the vacuum of outer space. The different spacecraft and the Endurance mother ship look as authentic as the outfits that our heroes wear. The strange but new worlds that they encounter during their search to locate a new Earth are breathtaking. One world consists of an eternal sea with towering waves that loom like mountain ranges, while another is as stark and icy as it is inhospitable. The theme of deception runs throughout ""Interstellar."" The faked Apollo moon landing and Dr. Brand's mind-blowing revelation are a few surprises that will maintain your interest throughout ""Interstellar."" Nolan generates several suspenseful set-pieces that will keep you poised on the edge of your seat. Matt Damon has a startling cameo as another astronaut who has succumbed to effects of isolation. Clocking in at 169 minutes, ""Interstellar"" amounts to an unforgettable epic with intense white-knuckled suspense, top-notch performances, and a terrific ending.","Hollywood science fiction spectacles antagonistic aliens abandoning dying worlds occupy Earth , also oust us popular moviegoers .

Interstellar,"Interstellar by Christopher NollanReviewed by Svetoslav GrigorovFirst, I had to look at the score on www.IMDb.com to confirm that all the rumors were true (9 out of 10): me and Paul were the only ones who didn't like this movie and left 45 minutes before it had finished. Whatever that means I can assure you that I was/am still sober and I am not a zombie like the rest of the crowd in the Kettering Odeon cinema. Secondly, I would like to ask how all these critics made the comparison(s) with Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and thirdly, please you who now read this review tell me that I am not the only one in my dullest disappointment for the year. Tell me that I haven't lost my marbles, tell me that you were enthralled from this copy of a House On The Prairie and if you think that this is the best movie of your life (or at least 2014), the only answer I can think of is: that's why so many rubbish movies have been released lately. Because the level of the quality has fallen drastically and the conveyor belt of the movie industry is catastrophic for the senses. OK, so straight to the point. First 45 minutes we are introduced to the farming, dust and the coming famine problems, nitrogen on the rise in the atmosphere, Earth is doomed, father and daughter found a super-secret location that NASA strategically placed for their eyes only. We see a lot of corn and even the nineties Children of The Corn was a better shallow slasher while this one turns out to be an American clichéd space marmalade, and my best fitting comparison for it is Armageddon which is not really a movie, but a joke. Wormholes, saving of the human kind, bringing resources, planting/replanting, Plan A /Plan B, frozen embryos to colonize a distant world, overcoming gravity, scientists and even a quantum physics and so much camera- philosophy that Kubrick will turn in his grave, daddy-please-don't-go-to-space-cause –I'm- gonna-cry, bam the watch on the floor (I don't wanna see you anymore), counting while going into the stratosphere, Lego-robot which somehow was better acting than the rest of the actors or at least was more fun. Wait, wait, did I say actors? Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine (The rest of them are not worth mentioning apart from the crying daughter Murph who did her best job).Matthew McConaughey has one of the most annoying twangs ever and his jaundiced bad- version-face of Paul Newman cannot contribute to any script lately (let's not forget that without the help of Jared Leto and his masterful transformation in The Dallas Buyers Club his Oscar was going to hell). His mumbling could be understood only from the villagers in Kentucky and what he is on aboutSeriously, I needed subtitles to comprehend his actor's efforts in such a ""serious"" movie. How serious this movie was! I pushed myself to read couple of the 'serious' critical reviews and they had the audacity to call it ""scientific""??? Oh man, poor Anne Hathaway who looked sometimes at the camera and was likely apologizing for the mess she was in. I felt sorry for her.The script was the hell of the hells. Such nonsense with no credibility and no creativity at all. Total zero or even below the zero. As I said we left long before the end because my time is precious. I will open Isaac Asimov's (or Stanislaw Lem's) short stories and will be engulfed in characters and situations, so my brain will be given food for thought while all these poor people are going to see Interbol..cks and will be exposed on the radiation of a mediocrity (yes, I felt cheated like someone was trying to insult me). Well, if you who now read this review respect yourself and really like Kubrick, Moon, Gravity (and even Contact) and other good sci-fi don't waste your time and save your money. Today we wasted £40 including the drinks, the popcorn and the tickets and the only thing that I was inspired for was my generated anger for this text. My verdict on the scale from 1 to 10 is to give ONE for the director Christopher Nolan who needs a little encouragement and I am hoping he will not slip into the shoes of M. Night Shyamalan who have crafted a lot of rubbish lately as you know. God forbid that never happens.P.S.Don't tell me that I have sat there for 2 (it's actually 169 minutes) hours of a film and it had a great ending cause I don't want know.","Interstellar Christopher NollanReviewed Svetoslav GrigorovFirst , look score www.IMDb.com confirm rumors true ( 9 10 ) : Paul ones n't like movie left 45 minutes finished .

Interstellar,"This film tells the story of an ex-pilot in a world full of dust storms. He is chosen to travel to the uncharted parts of the space in search for a new habitable planet.""Interstellar"" is a long film, and the first two hours of it does not seem like a typical Christopher Nolan film. Most of the scenes are (literally) down to Earth, with no fancy visual effects. It spends much time building up the story, telling the story of a father and his daughter who sees 'ghost' in her bedroom. Through this ghost, one thing led to another, and the man is in space. When the film is not down on Earth, it looks more like a disaster film. The first adventure is a spectacular feat involving water. It also introduces the physics of relativity, on how time slows down in another world, leading to a misguided decision of the astronauts in retrospect. This sets the foundation for future plot involving more relativity.As the film progresses, there is more adventure, both in the form of adrenaline pumping adventure and humanity and integrity testing conditions. Matt Damon's character forms a central subplot that makes me reflect on what lengths would people go in order to achieve a certain goal. It reflects on the reality that people are driven by egocentric instincts. It is not a pretty truth, but it tells that human are not idealistic creatures.The final half an hour is what a typical Christopher Nolan film is like. It makes me hold my breath because it is so intense, both emotionally and cognitively. The ending gives me inexplicable exhilaration. Things come to a full circle, and it is filled with joy.It is not a film for everyone, as the story is long and takes a lot of time to build. Two people walked out of the cinema an hour into the film, and someone sitting behind me remarked after the film ended that he opined it was the most boring Christopher Nolan film ever. For me, I enjoyed ""Interstellar"" thoroughly, because it is emotionally captivating and intellectually challenging.","film tells story ex-pilot world full dust storms . chosen travel uncharted parts space search new habitable planet . `` Interstellar '' long film , first two hours seem like typical Christopher Nolan film . scenes ( literally ) Earth , fancy visual effects . spends much time building story , telling story father daughter sees 'ghost ' bedroom . ghost , one thing led another , man space . film Earth , looks like disaster film . first adventure spectacular feat involving water . also introduces physics relativity , time slows another world , leading misguided decision astronauts retrospect . sets foundation future plot involving relativity.As film progresses , adventure , form adrenaline pumping adventure humanity integrity testing conditions .

Oppenheimer,"I wont comment on Nolan this, Nolan that. I would call this movie a masterpiece because of its humanity & complexity.Oppenheimer is shown as complex, flawed, egocentric patriot. For eg, he is attracted to pretty terrible women, which begs questions about himself. He is arrogant, a brilliant scientist, and a great salesman. He is flawed, but patriotic no matter what. That makes for a very interesting character study.There's also a lot to be said about the violence, and the willingness of groups & individuals to commit monstrous acts. I am very interested in the evil within us. American crowds cheering at the death of 100k+ civilians, women going into trance because of a powerful man wielding an unimaginable weapon of death. All righteous people, mind you. The office discussion about which Japanese cities to wipe out, distilled down to a simple list of names, with Kyoto struck off because of its historical value and honeymooning there was sweet. And ofc, the responsibility of arms control.Then there's betrayal, and the system using people as cogs, with the military squeezing the scientists then ignoring them, if not actively shutting them down. And how to live a life of service despite that, testing loyalty, values, amid the power plays of groups or individuals.Anyhow. A great study of the complexity of humanity, social systems, war, right and wrong, and our propensity for evil.

Oppenheimer,"Will some think this is boring? For sure. Will some think it's too long? Undoubtedly. But overall I thought this was a very quality film like most of Christopher Nolan's movies, and while this one isn't my favorite it's still good for what it is. It's a JFK-like historical drama. The acting/cast were all incredible and so was the set design, and also the lack of CGI and special effects. The directing and camera work were awesome too. The middle part with them detonating the test bomb was a very well-constructed and tense scene. It was also intelligent in a way to only show the American perspective of the war and how out of touch/indifferent they were with the suffering that they inflicted on the Japanese civilian population, except of course for the main character. He was portrayed very well and this movie is coming out at a very critical time in history, reminding us of the destructive potential of escalating to nuclear war with other countries (no matter the side) and that our responsibility with handling weaponized nuclear technology is not to be taken lightly, and we must have a moral conscience. The movie also showed the quick/immediate development of a post-war McCarthyist government which was portrayed how it should have been.

Oppenheimer,"The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event.I am perplexed to see so many high reviews about the movie. But I find it pretty average and one would not miss anything in life if he or she skips this movie.What I feel Mr. Chirstopher Nolan is losing its streak actually. Nolan was one of my favourite story teller but with every passing movie I am losing interest in his movies. Batman, Inception, Interstellar were absolute marvels and all time favourites of mine. But then Dunkrik, Tenet and Oppenheimer happend and I feeling his losing his touch on path breaking genre of movies. I feel less and less inclined now a days to watch his movies precisely because of dull topics he selects for story telling.

Oppenheimer,"I might have given it and extra star if it had been an hour shorter and I could have actually heard what the actors were saying.Why on earth this film needed to be 3 hours long is a complete mystery to me.

Oppenheimer,"Although the time passed quickly, ultimately, Oppenheimer has left me disappointed. The problem with this film is that it can't decide which story it tries to tell - building the bomb or the inquiry of the national security committee. Both of those stories are depicted well, Nolan uses nice narrative devices to locate the characters in their currently depicted temporal location, etc. However, the cheap moral that the film concludes with has been beaten to death and because of that it undermines everything the script tried to achieve. The film didn't leave me speechless and a rather poorly executed sequence of the denotation doesn't really justify the historic development of a black and white IMAX film stock.","Although time passed quickly , ultimately , Oppenheimer left disappointed . problem film ca n't decide story tries tell - building bomb inquiry national security committee . stories depicted well , Nolan uses nice narrative devices locate characters currently depicted temporal location , etc .

Oppenheimer,"It's gratifying to know that in a supposedly ""dumbed down"" America, a three-hour docudrama about a theoretical physicist and his atomic ""project,"" along with a closed-door security clearance hearing and an open Senate confirmation hearing, both full of dialogue and minimal ""action,"" is generating a huge, but deservedly so, box office. I found this film mesmerizing as the three hours seem to fly by for me. It has a very intelligent script, some masterful acting, and a focus on a fascinating, if enigmatic, character, i.e., Oppenheimer. The ""father"" of the atomic bomb was, indeed, a genius and generous-minded (on occasion), but also exhibited character flaws, and for such an adept administrator was also politically naïve.The physicists behind the letter to FDR knew Germany had a head start in nuclear power (Germany under Otto Hahn was the first nation to split the atom), and it would have been a dangerous world indeed if Hitler had a monopoly on the atomic bomb, but those same physicists were reluctant to use it against Japan in the waning days of the Pacific War, and Oppenheimer shared some of their reservations. The subsequent guilt he felt was manifest in a great scene in the film where he meets with Truman and says he has blood on his hands. Truman barks to him: ""no you don't; you built it but I authorized its use."" Later in the film, where he's being humiliated at the security clearance hearing, his psychologically astute wife asks him why is he putting up with this in person....""you must need this humiliation as penance for your guilt.""Kudos to Nolan for not, at least explicitly, tying the use of the two bombs to Japan's surrender. In fact, except for one high level meeting where potential targets are discussed, there's almost zero real-time reference to Hiroshima, Nagasaki, or the battleship Missouri. It's almost folklore in U. S. history, but not elsewhere, that the two bombs were solely crucial in bringing about a surrender from a fanatical enemy, but although most of us Americans don't want to believe this, Soviet entry into the war against Japan (at our behest; see Yalta) was probably more crucial. The 5-year Soviet-Japan Neutrality Pact offered some hope to Japan's War Cabinet that a negotiated settlement could moderately soften the blow of unconditional surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria that hope was irretrievably gone and the Japanese leadership was shocked. There are more references to Soviet entry into the war in the minutes of the War Cabinet than the the atomic bombs which were indeed appalling to the leadership. The Soviets invaded the Kuril Islands and had plans, if the war continued, of invading Japan's large northern island of Hokkaido. The War Cabinet wanted no parts of a Soviet, even if shared, occupation of any of the home islands.Another historical issue is prompted by the film, and that is the veiled depiction that the physicists who were Jewish seemed more interested (if necessary) in using the bomb against Nazi Germany (who could blame them as emigres) but very reluctant to use it against Japan in the closing days. There's one pre-war scene where Oppenheimer meets Heisenberg in Germany, and as depicted, it's a fairly amiable meeting. Heisenberg's WW II impact is interesting. He apparently led the German nuclear effort which was subsequently found to be not very far along. Why, with the head start they had? Some explanations: (1) Speer did not allocate sufficient financial resources, (2) a negative opinion on Heisenberg is that he tried hard but made lots of mistakes, (3) a positive opinion on Heisenberg is that he purposely sabotaged the Nazi effort, and (4) theoretical physics in Nazi Germany was referred to as Jewish physics.","'s gratifying know supposedly `` dumbed '' America , three-hour docudrama theoretical physicist atomic `` project , '' along closed-door security clearance hearing open Senate confirmation hearing , full dialogue minimal `` action , '' generating huge , deservedly , box office . found film mesmerizing three hours seem fly . intelligent script , masterful acting , focus fascinating , enigmatic , character , i.e. , Oppenheimer . `` father '' atomic bomb , indeed , genius generous-minded ( occasion ) , also exhibited character flaws , adept administrator also politically naïve.The physicists behind letter FDR knew Germany head start nuclear power ( Germany Otto Hahn first nation split atom ) , would dangerous world indeed Hitler monopoly atomic bomb , physicists reluctant use Japan waning days Pacific War , Oppenheimer shared reservations . subsequent guilt felt manifest great scene film meets Truman says blood hands .

Oppenheimer,"Having seen every single one of Nolan's films and considering him the G. O. A. T. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Sadly, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. It started slow and boring and stayed here pretty much the whole movie. There was nothing compelling that happened at all. I know it's as a biopic, but this is Nolan...and where some criticize Tenet for doing too much, he did far too little here. I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters, they did not develop the conflict he was alleged to have felt, it was so difficult to understand the actors at times due to low speaking, poor accents and ridiculously loud bursts of music and sound, and it was about 45-60 minutes too long with dialogue in many places that not progress the storyline in any substantive way nor was it interesting. The only thing that kept me awake as long as I did was that the movie jumps around between around 3-4 different time periods while telling Oppenheimer's story. But you could spend 30 min on Google and get the same information you get from this movie or watch any of then various documentaries out there and get more excitement.Was this a bad movie? No, not in the least. But the hype around this movie centered on 3 things: 1) Nolan, 2) His take on Oppenheimer, and 3) The start studded cast. Only the latter delivered, and having seen the movie I now understand why so many A and well liked B list actors were needed.","seen every single one Nolan 's films considering G. . A. T.

Oppenheimer,"The love for this movie is very perplexing. I keep reading words like ""masterpiece"" to describe it and I just don't see it. What I saw was a disjointed mess! No character development and very poor story telling. I suppose its erratic quality was intentional on the part or the director (perhaps to help us into the mind of Oppenheimer), but it most certainly didn't land for me. I checked the clock a lot. Had I been watching it on streaming, I'd probably have turned it off after the first 30 minutes or so.A lot of folks seemed to have problems with the sex scenes, saying they didn't add to the movie. I actually disagree. I felt the sex scenes stressed Oppenheimer's immature attitude toward women and really his general attitude towards others. I suppose this could have been accomplished without nudity, but I thought the sex scenes made sense in the context of an otherwise confusing narrative.I suppose the acting was decent, but the script was so boring it gave the actors little to work with. It felt so emotionless and lifeless to me. Most of Nolan's work feels that way to me. Even Murphey seemed bored by the role and not always sure of the character he was playing. Emily Blunt had that pointed scene towards the end, but for the most part, I was unsure of her character and her place in the film. I'd have been curious to see this same story told by Aaron Sorkin or Ron Howard or Wolfgang Peterson. Bottom line - snore. In fact I think I did doze off a few times.","love movie perplexing . keep reading words like `` masterpiece '' describe n't see . saw disjointed mess ! character development poor story telling . suppose erratic quality intentional part director ( perhaps help us mind Oppenheimer ) , certainly n't land . checked clock lot . watching streaming , 'd probably turned first 30 minutes so.A lot folks seemed problems sex scenes , saying n't add movie . actually disagree . felt sex scenes stressed Oppenheimer 's immature attitude toward women really general attitude towards others . suppose could accomplished without nudity , thought sex scenes made sense context otherwise confusing narrative.I suppose acting decent , script boring gave actors little work . felt emotionless lifeless .

Oppenheimer,"A full throated, adult - I mean to say perfectly serious - epic story about American exceptionalism and how that is more likely than not a total crock; what the film is truly about, at least in my immediate estimation before I sleep on it, is how easily it is to make many, many enemies in a country that is at SuperPower status in a world where Nazism can fold and then Communism (or just you know anyone the Government disagrees with) can be next. It's a terrifically absorbing and gloriously verbose film about the creation of the Atomic bomb, like the pure joy of watching science nerds writing feverishly on chalkboards (and the jar of marbles), but that's just part of it.What I think made Nolan really want to make this a reality, aside from Oppenheimer being an endlessly fascinating collection of mixed emotions and thoughts and genius and ""blood on my hands"" level of guilt, is how power is so completely at the mercy of who gets to be in control - and what it means for a fubdamentaly decent person to reckon with the power to destroy (the apple scene early on is an apt metaphor). The Branaugh line about giving the world the power to destroy itself, and not being prepared. It's even more than that: some may think they are prepared, while others just try to wash their hands with it. And all the while, you are plunged and plugged into a first-person perspective like few others this high-wired and singular (Taxi Driver is in this league). Haunting, really.Lots and lots of thoughts on this I still need to digest, but easily Nolan's greatest achievement at least as a writer - the dialog is constantly involving and urgent and dramatically alive (and just fun to listen to) in ways I'm not sure I've experienced from him, and the structure is going to keep me going back to it another half dozen times in the next year or two - and Downey Jr, among a titanic heavyweight cast ranging from Gary Oldman to Macon Blair, almost steals the movie from everyone as a world class shitbag (or, your typical DC power-player who got scorned once). And the ending is devastating.Some more thoughts on a second viewing: I know JFK gets brought up in reviews and with critics (and even Nolan himself), but I thought of Born on the Fourth of July for the set piece when Oppenheimer gives the speech; when Ron Kovic talks to the 4th of July crowd and all the sound drops out except for a baby crying and helicopters, it's a subjective perspective of PTSD to an extreme.I think Oppenheimer has that as well, and it's a traumatic sequence that really got to me on a second viewing, not only the blinding white light and the woman with tatters on her face, but the subjects as he's stumbling out who are a) making out, b) crying, c) vomiting, and other things. It's astonishing the degree there and at a few other key points where Nolan means to break apart his mind through his editing and camerawork.And after all Oppenheimer is a theoretical physicist who thought he could maintain himself with what he was doing, and he absolutely could not.... but then I think Nolan's point here, as Stone maybe had with initially deluded boy scout Kovic and Vietnam, is that... who can ever face that? It's bigger than everyone on a psychic level. It's about how Science and Politics can't be compatible. That's chilling to me.Nitpick on this rewatch: Florence Pugh is not given a lot to work with past ""I'm kind of batty and tragic,"" and while Emily Blunt gets more to do and is terrific, and I dont mean to say Pugh phones it in on what she's asked to do, it seems kind of reductive that she is more of a story device. This doesn't mean she doesn't have a pivotal moment - I don't mean necessarily *that* line - the dialog right before it, where Oppy tells her about nearly poisoning his professor. Is he Jungian? Is he that kind of helmet from Full Metal Jacket, Born to Kill and Peace symbol? Not quite, it's more complicated than that... or maybe so simple. Which makes that Pugh's Isadora and her small role more difficult to accept.Or, to put it into comparison with the Aviator, which is strangely another film I thought of this time (not just because Nolan at one time wanted to make a Hughes biopic, rather both films deal with subjects who have mania and horrible weights on their shoulders, this one though far more grave), if Blunt is Katherine Hepburn than Pugh is Ava Gardner.

The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently.

Oppenheimer,"For every minute that passes during the 3-hour run time of the movie Oppenheimer, 1200 citizens in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki died. If you haven't got to see the movie it's worth pointing out that Oppenheimer - is not an anti nuclear movie. Nor is it a dramatic reconstruction of the devastating consequences of the use of the first nuclear bombs against the citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. For this, you would be better advised to seek out the superior acclaimed BBC drama documentary Hiroshima (2005.)
That film graphically dramatised what it is like to live through a Nuclear attack, millisecond by horror filled millisecond.The Oppenheimer movie pretty much sidled past that part of the horror story.Oppenheimer is a well made biopic of a man, or to be more accurate - a ghoul. A man who wilfully, along with his Los Alamos buddies, messed round with plutonium, mined from thousands of uranium mines to build a weapon that would annihilate the civilian populations of two cities and possibly one day humanity.What's good: A fast paced immersive movie into the allegedly tortured mind of the director of the Manhattan Project J. Robert Oppenheimer. His team delivered a fission bomb to the US airforce at the cost of $2 billion dollars. The lead up to and the culmination of the Trinity Test contains the movie's strongest moments.What's bad: The story of the creation of the worst imaginable weapon and the consequences of its use is virtually skimmed over in favour of the McCarthy era security hearing of Oppenheimer in 1954, which resulted in his losing his 'security clearance.'
The hearing, the movie shows, was secretly instigated by Levi Strauss, the director of the post war Atomic Energy Commission. Strauss who had taken over the Manhattan project in 1946, never got on with Oppenheimer, who apposed the development of the hydrogen bomb.While it's an interesting story, it decidedly distracts from the real horror of what happened to the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and descends - somewhat - into yet another attempt to justify the actions and subsequent hegemony of the United States. They even manage to name check JFK near the end for a little old fashioned jingoism.It's a good movie. But it would be timely for Netflix to stream When the Wind Blows (1986) and The Day After (1983) as well as the aforementioned BBC Hiroshima (2005)","every minute passes 3-hour run time movie Oppenheimer , 1200 citizens cities Hiroshima Nagasaki died . n't got see movie 's worth pointing Oppenheimer - anti nuclear movie . dramatic reconstruction devastating consequences use first nuclear bombs citizens Hiroshima Nagasaki . , would better advised seek superior acclaimed BBC drama documentary Hiroshima ( 2005 . ) film graphically dramatised like live Nuclear attack , millisecond horror filled millisecond.The Oppenheimer movie pretty much sidled past part horror story.Oppenheimer well made biopic man , accurate - ghoul . man wilfully , along Los Alamos buddies , messed round plutonium , mined thousands uranium mines build weapon would annihilate civilian populations two cities possibly one day humanity.What 's good : fast paced immersive movie allegedly tortured mind director Manhattan Project J.

Oppenheimer,"Nolan strangely moves from petentious films, bad ones right away after you take the glitter away, to straight ahead masterworks of movie making. He seams to go 1 good 1 bad each time. Now it was time for a good one after the pretentious, sloppy Tenet. And boy did he deliver. This is a wonderful, challenging, unapologetic, very brave in some political way piece of movie making. Well acted all along, well written, large in scope but fully accomplishing. But it's what lies underneath what I love the most.

Oppenheimer,"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film.","0 10 starsChristopher Nolan 's Oppenheimer bloated , overwrought , ultimately unsatisfying film . film three hours long , feels even longer , thanks Nolan 's penchant unnecessary scenes characters . supporting characters flat one-dimensional , n't enough time develop.The sound music also loud , overused , noisy . illusory scenes glaring disturbing . film also visually confusing , Nolan 's trademark use shaky cameras quick cuts.The bright spot film Matt Damon 's performance General Leslie Groves .

Oppenheimer,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view.

Oppenheimer,"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet.","Review - Oppenheimer Rating Ten plus 10/10 Cinemas nowIf movie represent last one hundred years existence planet placed time capsule opened 100 years time chance planet still existence Oppenheimer.This truly astonishing achievement Cinema storytelling covering wide arc world events personalities played pivotal roles 20th Century affect us today many still responsible fear instability around Globe.Oppenheimer written directed Christopher Nolan chilling disturbing engrossing movie sit 3 hours 's enlightening.I found Shakespearian portrayal human folly pursuit power corrupts jealousy lies spread like cancer undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler , J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy , Mussolini mentioned establish timeline name n't appear Oppenheimer however influence consequences tyranny obvious examine life Julius Robert Oppenheimer 1927 studied physics Germany returning America eventually recruited 1942 work Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer appointed director Manhattan project situated desert New Mexico Los Alamos Laboratory town specifically built one purpose . personnel Los Alamos Oppenheimer tasked developing first nuclear weapons , four years start German nuclear weapons program.The second half Oppenheimer found compelling inventor destructive force ever unleashed planet sidelined vilified terrible deliberate destruction 1945 bombings Hiroshima Nagasaki Japan ended one war know today nothing end war volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing beginning movie - , `` become Death , destroyer worlds '' , sums suspicion guilt fear destruction two cities Nagasaki Hiroshima President Harry Truman chose destroy glibly commenting would spare Kyoto 's beautiful city wife shared wonderful honeymoon .After events Oppenheimer vilified investigated Communist witch hunts 1950 's many ego driven powerful adversaries summon testify hearings prove 's traitor.The performances Oppenheimer stunning cast includes Cillian Murphy , Emily Blunt , Robert Downey Jr. , Matt Damon , Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti , Josh Harnett , Florence Pugh , Rami Malek Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances Irish actor Cillian Murphy title role J Robert Oppenheimer truly Oscar worthy performance . impressive quiet complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played Emily Blunt one finest performances moments movie also earn Oscar nomination.The standouts Robert Downey Jr. Lewis Strauss vindictive complicated associate Oppenheimer betrays friend sake ambition.The look movie also impressive especially huge screen like local GMax .

Oppenheimer,"""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it. Theory will take you only so far."" J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy)The ""it"" is the atomic bomb, for which Oppenheimer was called ""The Father."" Writer/director Christopher Nolan has adapted the authoritative 2005 bio ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Nolan, surveying Oppenheimer's life and especially his leadership of The Manhattan Project, has crafted a harrowing story deeply embedded in our history as Oppenheimer developed the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that helped end WWII.Yet, this film is not really about the making of the bombs-it is rather about the turmoil surrounding Oppenheimer with such weighty questions about killing tens of thousands of civilians with the bombs, whether that would force Japan to surrender, and whether or not he was a Communist.Nolan keeps it favorable to history only now and then emphasizing interactions that cannot be verified such as conversations with his wife, the alcoholic Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Murphy underplays masterfully Oppenheimer's struggles while he carefully considers each challenge, like the scientist he plays. Just as upending are the anti -Communist attacks that dogged him through his professional life.Along with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, Nolan captures the vast loneliness of the new Mexico desert using 65 mm film projected in 70mm. As in Dunkirk (2017), Nolan uses the process to mirror the magnitude of the subject and the intellectual excitement following Einstein's 1915 publishing of his theory of general relativity-it's the chalkboards that announce mankind's precipitate changes and provide the intellectual excitement eclipsing even that of the bomb itself.Nolan's mixing black and white and then color helps to relieve the monotony for some of the film's three hours but mostly shows the upheaval of his life, especially the last third in black and white, where the antisemitic Red Scare threatened his legacy as scientist and humanitarian.His turn as critic of nuclear war toward the end of his life was not without attendant compromise of his achievements. Perhaps his thoughts as he saw the first test mushroom cloud said it all about how his research for the bomb changed him and the world:""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" ""Oppenheimer"" is the best movie of the year so far and one of the great war movies of all time.","`` wo n't fear understand . wo n't understand 've used . Theory take far . '' J.

Oppenheimer,"I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history.","excited see film , ended feeling really disappointed . overall structure convoluted mess .

Die_Hard,"Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced, professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying, evil, brilliant, and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other, and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role, it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy, tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, blood pouring everywhere, and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100% classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 10/10","course Action Genre existed Die Hard .

Die_Hard,"1988 and the undisputed number one action star was that Austrian body builder with the funny name with that monosylabic guy from ROCKY in second place . The thing I hated about Arnie and Sly is that their action movies were uninvolving with over blown battle scenes where the good guys never seemed to be in danger of dying . I was also going to bring the James Bond franchise into the conversation but the series became a parody when Bond stopped speaking with a Scottish accent sometime in the early 70s
DIE HARD is different to the other 80s action fests with John McLane being a fairly believable genre character . Okay he`s two dimensional but that`s got to be one dimension more than John Rambo who only exists to kill a lot of nasty commies so Americans can flock to the cinema . It`s also interesting to note that McLane`s wife is used in the plot which is slightly different from how most action films work out where the hero is normally single , but that`s probably because DIE HARD as more depth to it than many contemparies. Perhaps the biggest difference is that McLane is slightly flawed as we`re shown one scene where the hero gives the bad guys something they want , not something you`d see in a Arnie or Sly movie . I won`t mention the stunts or the tightly written set pieces or how compelling they are because everyone else has beat me to it , except to say that big explosions and gun fights often overwhelm an action movie ( Bond movies are a good example ) but here they occur from the narrative instead of someone cramming them into the script in a vain attempt to thrill the audience . Normally I`d have a fit that an action blockbuster is well inside the IMDB top 250 but DIE HARD does deserve to be there since it`s the best movie of its type of its era .","1988 undisputed number one action star Austrian body builder funny name monosylabic guy ROCKY second place . thing hated Arnie Sly action movies uninvolving blown battle scenes good guys never seemed danger dying . also going bring James Bond franchise conversation series became parody Bond stopped speaking Scottish accent sometime early 70s DIE HARD different 80s action fests John McLane fairly believable genre character .

Die_Hard,"... and there was a big question mark there in 1988 because up until that time Willis had been only the thorn in Maddie Hayes' side in the TV show that unleashed him on the world, ""Moonlighting"", and tabloid headline fuel with all of his after hours exploits. John Goodman later said that he was just as drunk and disorderly as Willis was, but pre Roseanne nobody knew who the heck he was, so he was given a pass. But I digress.On Christmas Eve NYPD cop John McClane(Bruce Willis) is in LA to visit his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) at her place of business as a company Christmas party is in progress. She wanted to chase a big career and a big promotion on the west coast with a Japanese company, and John wanted to stay in New York as a cop. That is about the extent of their disagreement, but it put 2000 miles between them. But while they are talking a bunch of terrorists break in. They are actually just thieves, but they are using a terrorism angle as a front for the theft. They don't count on one thing though - McClane. They don't see him so he slips away and spends the evening thwarting their plans. The bad guys spend their evening trying to kill McClane. Why don't they use his wife as leverage? They don't know Bedelia's character is his wife.At one point McClane triggers a fire alarm and a lone cop, Powell, is sent to investigate. That lone cop talks to McClane through a radio and tells McClane he shot a kid once on the job, and he doesn't think he is capable of using his gun even if he must. The radio-bound comradery between the two is very good, in between all of the action.This is very likely one of the very best action films ever made. It has non-stop thrills, human interest, great acting by Willis which I think surprised everybody, and lampoons the media by showing them as lapdogs that eat up the contrived terrorist drivel they are fed by the thieves/kidnappers. And Alan Rickman gives a delicious performance as the head terrorist that is only surpassed by his role in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves three years later.Try it, as most big hits that were first in a franchise, it is much better than any of its sequels primarily because nobody was expecting it to be such a megahit, thus it is somewhat humble in its presentation. And that always helps.","... big question mark 1988 time Willis thorn Maddie Hayes ' side TV show unleashed world , `` Moonlighting '' , tabloid headline fuel hours exploits .

Die_Hard,"The 1988 was the movie that definitely put Bruce Willis on the radar for me, as this movie turned out to be such a blast of an action movie back in 1988. In fact, it is a movie that still holds up in 2020; where I just revisited it yet again.""Die Hard"" is very much a late 1980s action movie with everything that term carries. And ""Die Hard"" placed Bruce Willis right up there alongside the likes of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Seagal and Van Damme back in the late 1980s.The storyline told in ""Die Hard"" is an enjoyable and entertaining storyline, one that actually has enough contents and material to it to support several viewings over the years. And while one does know the story after having seen the movie, there is just something solid about it to make it possible to watch it again and again.Now, they cast some nice performers for ""Die Hard"". Needless to mention Bruce Willis in this movie, but Alan Rickman in the role of Hans Gruber was just so well-cast because he performed so well and that role was just tailored for him and his charismatic presence. I remember being rather impressed with seeing Reginald VelJohnson (playing Al Powell) in this movie back in 1988, as I had only seen him on that TV series ""Family Matters"".Some people claim that ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas movie. I beg to differ. Just because the story was set to take place during the Christmas holidays doesn't make it a Christmas movie, nor does ""Die Hard"" have the contents to be a Christmas movie in any way. So nay, I am not one of those claiming that ""Die Hard"" is a Christmas classic.If you haven't already seen ""Die Hard"", then there is something wrong, because this is one of the defining action movies of the late 1980s.

Die_Hard,"Die Hard is an action picture with a capital 'A'. In fact, you might as well go ahead and capitalize the whole darn word. It's an expertly constructed machine for mayhem - a relentlessly thrilling, masterfully executed action film that turns up all the knobs and sets the standard for all of the American films made in the genre.To begin with, it's the classic plot hook of one man against many, right against wrong - a sweaty, bare-chested, all-American hero who battles a band of swarthy, heavily accented terrorist villains. But Die Hard is more layered than your average action movie. It is Christmas Eve. John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York cop, is in town to spend the holidays with his kids and to fashion a reconciliation with his estranged wife Holly, who works for the Los Angeles branch of Nakatomi Corporation. Planning a rather different holiday agenda are the terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). The dastardly dozen invade the plush 30th floor offices of Nakatomi during its Christmas party, and hold the employees hostage as a computer whiz cracks a code that will put our bad guys in possession of $600 million in negotiable bonds. McClane's in the john when the bad guys arrive, and he manages to slip away into the bowels of the building with nothing but his handgun, where he becomes the fly in the ointment of the criminals' plans. As the FBI helplessly marshals its forces outside, it's up to McClane to carry on the battle from within. McClane must scrap his way through the mêlée, free the hostages, and in the process repair his troubled marriage. Shirtless and barefoot, McClane swings through elevator shafts, clambers up heating ducts and creeps across rooftops as he tries to pick off the bad guys one by one. There's something satisfyingly claustrophobic about the premise, and the movie makers fully realize it's potential. Director John McTiernan works here with a clever script that offers ample opportunity for violence that is mind-boggling without being mindless. He composes the action cleanly and logically allowing the proceedings to acquire a sense of scale that can't help but impress. The film always looks gorgeous, and it never stops being exhilarating.At the center of this whirlwind of a movie is Bruce Willis, who blends the vulnerability - normally unseen in action film heroes - deftly with the requisite superhuman feats. He almost burns the screen with his overwhelming charisma, his wicked sense of humor and his big-balled bravado. He ensures McClane remains human and relatable, even as the bodies pile up around him. The rogues in the movie pitch in equally commendable performances, particularly Alan Rickman. Smarmy yet charismatic, Rickman adds a theatrical flourish to his performance which only makes him more menacing. Sleekly engineered, impeccably staged and shrewdly dosed with humor and sentiment, Die Hard manages to be heart-pounding and teeth- gritting every single time.

Die_Hard,"When it comes to action-adventure films of the 1980s. You have Raiders of the Lost Ark standing as a colossus. The ultimate homage to the 1930 'B' serials. Hot on its heels is Die Hard the ultimate action- thriller.Bruce Willis was known for the comedy crime-drama Moonlighting and comedy movies such as Blind Date. He was not someone with bulging muscles like Sylvester Stallone or a former martial arts star or bodybuilder.John McClane the everyman who happens to be a New York cop visiting his estranged wife at her firm's Christmas party, rather partial to Roy Rogers ends up being in the wrong place at the wrong time.Just as the party gets into full swing a bunch of European terrorists take over the office tower block to rob some financial bonds, led by the magnetic and then unknown Alan Rickman (who in those pre Google days, some critics mistook to be some undiscovered German actor readymade to be a Bond villain!)However as the villains hold the rest of the group hostage waiting for their plan to unfurl including getting an assist from the FBI, there is a fly on the ointment. McClane is on the loose and picking off the bad guys one by one.You have a beat cop in contact with McClane, some inept cops, even more inept and gung ho FBI agents, a slimy journalist and a film director on top form giving you one of the best action films of all time.A mixture of thrills, action and humour. Just look at scene when Uli (the far eastern bad guy) glances at the chocolate bar during a tense moment and steals it, or Rickman naming some freedom fighter groups which seem to be made up.

Die_Hard,"One of my criteria for the best-of-the-best, top-shelf classic movies is that it is hard to imagine a world in which they did not exist. When it comes to ""Die Hard"", this film absolutely fits that description: a world without John McClane, Hans Gruber, and the Nakatomi Plaza seems utterly incomprehensible.For a very basic overview, ""Die Hard"" tells the story of John McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York cop invited to an LA business party by his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia). The couple are estranged, creating an awkward dynamic, and things go from bad to worse when a group of international terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) choose that night to raid the vault in the building's basement. With the police presence continually bungling the situation, it is up to John McClane to single-handedly take charge of matters.In terms of action set pieces alone, ""Die Hard"" would still be considered one of the best of all-time. Jumps off skyscrapers, helicopter chases, epic gun battles, perfectly paced espionage...it's all here. Yet, what elevates the film to the stratosphere is both the characterization and acting present in the John McClane character.Essentially, McClane is a ""wrong place, wrong time, right person for the job"" sort of protagonist. Yet, not in the Rambo or Schwarzenneger mode whatsoever. No, John McClane is the ""everyman"" who just happens to be a cop that can think on his feet. His reactions and wisecracks--perfectly created by the writers and Willis' acting talent--portray this expertly. He is what all the viewers would want to be in a similar scenario, and just believeable/attainable to be infinitely engaging. From his engaging marital backstory to his ability to keep a cool head and crack wise even in the most dire situations, John McClane is truly one of the greatest characters ever put to celluloid.Of course, the auxiliary cast is almost as iconic. Bedelia is great as Holly, while Rickman's Gruber (from accent to mannerisms) is basically as culturally well-known as Willis' McClane now! Paul Gleason (aka ""the principal in The Breakfast Club) plays a cop you'll love to hate, Reginald VelJohnson is the cop you'll be rooting for, and even De'voreaux White's Argyle chips in with some tension-breaking humor. Every performance here has stood the test of time.Overall, I consider ""Die Hard"" to be one of the finest films ever made, largely due to the John McClane character. But even taken as a whole product, this movie will forever remain the standard by which all subsequent action romps are judged.","One criteria best-of-the-best , top-shelf classic movies hard imagine world exist . comes `` Die Hard '' , film absolutely fits description : world without John McClane , Hans Gruber , Nakatomi Plaza seems utterly incomprehensible.For basic overview , `` Die Hard '' tells story John McClane ( Bruce Willis ) , New York cop invited LA business party wife Holly ( Bonnie Bedelia ) . couple estranged , creating awkward dynamic , things go bad worse group international terrorists led Hans Gruber ( Alan Rickman ) choose night raid vault building 's basement . police presence continually bungling situation , John McClane single-handedly take charge matters.In terms action set pieces alone , `` Die Hard '' would still considered one best all-time .

Die_Hard,"No doubt about it, to a lot of people, Bruce Willis will ALWAYS be John McClane, for better or worse.In the film that made him a star, or at least got him out of TV work, Bruce Willis is New York native cop John McClane, come down to LA to see his estranged wife and family for the Christmas holiday. Then Hans (Alan Rickman, in one of his best evil performances) and a group of thieves posing as terrorists who look European male models and an obnoxious black computer hacker show up, take over the building and try to rob the place. Only McClane can stop them, and his only real support comes from Sgt. Al Powell (played by the dad from TV's ""Family Matters""). Calamity, chaos and mayhem ensue as McClane and the foreign thugs tear the building apart trying to kill each other in the ultimate battle of all American cowboy hero and sophisticated Eurotrash and the idiot cops and FBI gets trip over themselves to help out.Based on the novel by Roderick Thorpe. Bonnie Bedelia is Bruce's wife, and the late Alexander Godunov is Karl, who's vendetta with Bruce turns personal. Bonnie does well as the sympathetic wife with a bad haircut and Godunov, in a role very different from his debut part as an Amish farmer in ""Witness"", is surprisingly menacing in spite of his pretty boy looks. Of course, it helps that his career as a ballet dancer gave him more dexterity than the usual hulking henchman. His knock-down-drag-out brawl with Willis is one of the best.Alan Rickman commented that he didn't view Hans as ""the villain"", but more as a guy who ""has made certain choices in life, wants certain things in life and goes after them."" All the same, Alan is the perfect villain for Bruce's wise cracking McClane, who is neither weak nor super human. Bruce worked very hard on this film and allegedly did a lot of his own stunts and really brought a lot of life and warmth to a character who could very easily have been just another grim loner. It's a shame that he's had to spend the majority of his career trying to get away from this character (kind of like Sean Connery trying to live down his glory days as James Bond). And to think that Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Burt Reynolds and Richard Gere all turned this part down (probably better that they did).
Sadly, the appeal of the McClane character was lost in #3 ""Die Hard: With A Vengeance"", where McClane HAD become a grim, burned out, wasted loner.
A big part of the power of ""Die Hard"" is that there are no easy escapes, very few places to run and very little ""cheating"" as director John McTiernan put it. And it's true that very few moments require you to suspend logical disbelief, although we do have to question if it's possible to successfully pull of the stunt where Bruce jumps off the building with a hose wrapped around him.So grab the popcorn and get ready for the madness of ""Die Hard""! This is actually one of the few action films my family and I enjoy watching together. This was actually filmed at the 20th Century Fox Plaza.","doubt , lot people , Bruce Willis ALWAYS John McClane , better worse.In film made star , least got TV work , Bruce Willis New York native cop John McClane , come LA see estranged wife family Christmas holiday .

Die_Hard,"'Die Hard' is without a doubt the pinnacle of classic action films and a highlight of the 80s. There's only one name that terrorist fear; McClane!1. In a time when a new action star was needed, a young Bruce Willis rose to the challenge amidst the likes of Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Reluctantly on a trip to Los Angeles to meet his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and kids, John McClane (Bruce Willis) finds himself under the radar of a terrorist plot on Christmas Eve. Willis really was a breath of fresh air at the time of this film's release, considering no one knew what to expect since action stars of that era were damn near body-building types.2. As far as Willis is concerned, with every great hero...there must be a great villain to follow; enter Alan Rickman (Hans Gruber). Apart from '007' films, Rickman defined what a suave, intelligent and deadly antagonist can be. No matter how bad a villain is, it's equally fun to have a formidable henchman at his side, which (the late) Alexander Godunov (Karl) portrays with sheer brutality. However sad it was to hear of Rickman's passing, his legacy still lives on in his most memorable and career defining role as Hans Gruber.3. Behind a great action-flick like this, stood an exceptional director. John McTiernan proved his worth in the realm of action the previous year when he directed another cult and sci-fi classic; 'Predator'. It was clearly a no-brainer having him on board and in turn, McTiernan also went on to direct the third film in the franchise: 'Die Hard: With a Vengeance'. His directing style is obvious as can be since the action sequences are well maintained so that things never get derailed or too crazy.4. Reginald Vel Johnson and Paul Gleason round out the main cast, with memorable side characters as well that stand in as other terrorists and comic reliefs respectively. Willis himself adds more of the humor to the film when he finds himself in stressful situations as the film progresses. He just has a natural charm as McClane which no other action star has ever brought to a character before.To find things that don't work about this film is a hard task, cause I honestly can't think of anything. When spectacle meets action, that's when you'll know that old habits DIE HARD!!!","'Die Hard ' without doubt pinnacle classic action films highlight 80s .

Die_Hard,Die Hard is one of many action films made in the 1980s. Part of them weren't very good but some are real classics. This first Die Hard movie is one of those classics. Other Die Hard movies aren't as good as the first though I think Die Hard 3 and 4 are very good too. Before Die Hard series Bruce Willis was just a television actor. John McTiernan is the director of the movie.On Christmas Eve John McClane (Willis) who is a police from New York comes to Los Angeles to meet his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) who works for the Nakatomi Corporation. The company is holding a party at Nakatomi Plaza where Holly is invited too. Soon after John and Holly has argued Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) who is a West German former political radical and his armed henchmen take control of the building. They are going to steal 640 million dollars.The movie is very exciting. The chemistry between the main characters John McClane and Hans Gruber is the most important thing why Die Hard is so good movie. McClane is a traditional hero character who opposes crime. Willis brings much rough charisma to his character. McClane's sense of humour is also very ruthless. Gruber is a manipulative criminal and mastermind. He is very cool and insensitive man. Rickman was even better as Gruber than Willis as McClane. His role work is of the highest quality. Gruber's very violent henchman Karl is totally crazy guy and memorable character. Gruber is maybe the best movie villain ever. The Plot isn't too simple. I think action scenes are more credible because computers and special effects don't play a big role in the movie.In my opinion Die Hard is best action movie ever. 10/10.,Die Hard one many action films made 1980s .

Die_Hard,"Bruce Willis stars as John McClane, a New York cop who flies out to Los Angeles to meet with his estranged wife at a Christms party in an LA Highrise that belongs to a wealthy company for which his wife works. Unknown to the guests, a group of terrorists headed by Alan Rickman takes everyone hostage, except McClane who manages to sneak by. Left with only his pistol, brains, and brawn McClane starts to give the bad guys hell.US action pictures were never the same after this film came out in 1988 and in watching it you can easily see why. Placed in one building over one night with one hero, who could have imagined such an exciting movie? Other 80s action films, while many of them are classics, never quite managed to accomplish what Die hard did so well. It is not the relentless action nor the characterization, but both of them combined. McClane is introduced like any other cop would be and not like some big guy who is obviously going to kick ass like say Schwarzenegger was shown in Commando. This film put a real human side to its hero - he's tough as nails, but not invincible. He relies on his brains and his brawn. He winces in pain, but pushes on. And of course he snaps wise-cracks and quotable lines: I mean who can truly forget ""yippy-kah-yay, motherf***er"" after seeing this movie even once?And it is not just the hero, but the villains he combats as well. They have their unlikable side and are obviously meant to be the bad guys, but they have their brains, their brawn, and of course their own weaknesses. Scripters Jeb Stuart and Steven de Souza must have gone about describing the villains pretty carefully in their screenplay and they have created a memorable bunch little army that is not your typical cardboard cut out set of villains. They range from a hacker who can't fight if his life depended on it to the mountainous assault rifle packing Karl who makes John McClane's day especially bad. Interestingly, Karl's seemingly endless fury isn't just an excuse to have a ""real tough ass"" bad guy, but it is characterized and introduced in of itself.Also, the music is very well developed. Beethoven's 9th is the backdrop for the score and it is interesting to see how it was put into the story in a both diagetic and a non-diagetic level. Added to that, they even put a Christmas twist to it.Finally, when you consider the fact that this one movie not only spawned an overall great trilogy, but a whole little sub-genre of ""Die Hard on a..."" makes this a great film all around. 10/10Rated R: violence and profanity","Bruce Willis stars John McClane , New York cop flies Los Angeles meet estranged wife Christms party LA Highrise belongs wealthy company wife works .

Die_Hard,"Is there anyone out there who hasn't seen Die Hard? It's an American staple in the universally loved genre of action movies, so unless you really don't like them, you've probably seen it. I'll tell you a secret: I fell asleep the first time I watched it. Thanks to the magical DVD player and the boxed set of Die Hard DVDs my dad bought, there've been ample opportunities to rectify my mistake and watch the movie again.In this Bruce Willis classic, action, tense drama, comedic one-liners, and Christmas are all mixed together to make a winning combination. Walking barefoot on broken glass might not be the type of scene you want to watch him in during the holidays, but Die Hard has been added to many people's Christmas movie traditions. He plays the iconic policeman John McLane-with an iconic catchphrase that isn't appropriate to write out or say in front of children-who, on Christmas Eve, winds up fighting the scary Alan Rickman, a German terrorist who takes a building full of people hostage, instead of reconciling with his wife, which was his original plan for the evening.Sometimes the old action flicks wind up becoming cheesy over time. While I'm not one to call 1988 an ancient time, this movie has had time to settle, and even among the young, impatient audiences of today, it's still enjoyed and entertaining. When James Shigeta says, ""You'll just have to kill me,"" he's not saying anything new; hostages have always whimpered to villains that they don't have the needed information, and the villains always shrug and let them live. In Die Hard, Alan Rickman shrugs and follows James's suggestion. It's iconic, funny, terrible, and makes Alan both a wonderful and frightening villain. Get ready to start quoting both the hero and the villain, and you're guaranteed to have a ""yippe ki-yay"" of a good time.","anyone n't seen Die Hard ?

Die_Hard,"(r#56)This was an exhilarating movie that anyone should be able to enjoy. Bruce Willis shines in his breakthrough role as John McClane, the wise-cracking hard-ass cop. Willis, although a rookie actor, handles his shamelessly bad-ass one-liners as well as his dramatic scenes very well and never feels unbelievable. Alan Rickman almost steals the show from Bruce himself as the ultimate German villain, Hans Gruber. Rickman is a fantastic actor and it makes me sad to see him sleepwalking through The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and the Harry Potter series when he should be focusing on finding a good script instead. We need more movies like Galaxy Quest and Die Hard from him.John McTiernan creates a perfect balance between the smashing action sequences, the character development and the humour, and as a result, Die Hard is one of very few movies that can be called ""perfect"" blockbusters. McTiernan had previously directed the Arnold classic Predator, but in my opinion Die Hard blows its predecessor out of the water in terms of pure awesomeness. The script is shock full of memorable lines that seem to have been written for Willis. The tension is thick throughout, but the comedy (mainly provided by McClane's one-liners, but also by a pathetically incompetent police deputy and an ignorant newsreader) never feels out of place or forced. It is perfection on all levels, and I wish that I could've been born in the late seventies just so I could've seen this film in the theatre. I don't think any fan of action could dislike Die Hard, and neither would most fans of movies in general. It is a great thrill-ride from start to finish and features some of the greatest one-lines in history. It's just plain awesome even 18 years after its release. See it.","( r # 56 ) exhilarating movie anyone able enjoy . Bruce Willis shines breakthrough role John McClane , wise-cracking hard-ass cop .

Die_Hard,"Die Hard still remains, to this day, one of the best action films of all time. Directed by John McTiernan (The Hunt for Red October, Predator) and written by Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive), the story packs a great amount of action and suspense with memorably immortal characters.The acting: This was the film that propelled Bruce Willis to absolute stardom. Starring as the charismatic Officer John McClane of the NYPD, Willis lacks the Schwarzenegger-esque physique but shows us you don't need bulging muscles to defeat your foes. Rather, he is presented as the everyday Joe who is thrust into a flurry of German terrorists. His screen presence is strong throughout, with his witty one-liners (Yippy-Ki-yay, motha*****) and believable character development. There are smaller details presented where Willis reveals more of a vulnerable side to him (usually when he is alone) that perfectly contrasts his 'cop machismo'. As he barely escapes one threat presented after another, we are reminded that this is a normal guy in a highly abnormal situation.Another character who absolutely owns his screen time is Hans Gruber, played by an electric Alan Rickman. He gives a spectacular performance as the leader of the terrorists - conniving, intelligent and also has a comical side. His subtly sinister demeanor keeps us on the edge of our seat and we relish his every move. Perhaps that is why Die Hard has succeeded where so many other action films have failed. We are equally engrossed by both the virtuous and villainous figures presented.The screenplay: Taking place in predominantly one area for the majority of the film, Die Hard delivers one taut thrill after another. The sense of realism and grittiness does not seem too far-fetched, even for an action flick. The explosions are not superfluous and the gore is not unnecessary – it all helps in developing McClaine's character and shows us the right extent of how chaotic things become for him.I particularly loved the meta-humor (""This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly."" ""That was Gary Cooper, a**hole."") And banter was common in this film, whether it being between Hans and John, John and Office Powell. The superb dialogue, acting and direction manage to elevate this film an echelon above its action-film wannabes.","Die Hard still remains , day , one best action films time .

Die_Hard,"The idea has a certain allure to it: A cop is trapped inside a high-rise with a team of desperate terrorists. He is all that stands between them and their hostages. Give the terrorist leader brains and a personality, make one of the hostages the estranged wife of the cop and you've got a movie. Die Hard,"" and it stars Bruce Willis in another one of those Hollywood action roles where the hero's shirt is ripped off in the first reel so you can see how much time he has been spending at the gym. He's a New York cop who has flown out to Los Angeles for Christmas, and we quickly learn that his marriage was put on hold after his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) left for the Coast to accept a great job offer. They, too, are a multinational group, led by a German named Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) who is well-dressed and has a neatly trimmed beard and talks like an intellectual and thinks he is superior to the riffraff he has to associate with. He has a plan that has been devised with clockwork precision involving the theft of millions of dollars in negotiable bonds, and it is only after Willis starts causing trouble that he is forced to take the Nakatomi employees as hostages. But then the filmmakers introduce a gratuitous and unnecessary additional character: the deputy police chief (Paul Gleason), who doubts that the guy on the other end of the radio is really a New York cop at all. Without the deputy chief and all that he represents, ""Die Hard"" would have been a more than passable thriller. With him, it's a mess, and that's a shame, because the film does contain superior special effects, impressive stunt work and good performances, especially by Rickman as the terrorist. Here's a suggestion for thrillermakers: You can't go wrong if all of the characters in your movie are at least as intelligent as most of the characters in your audience.","idea certain allure : cop trapped inside high-rise team desperate terrorists . stands hostages .

Die_Hard,"In the 1980s, a unique trend developed in American Cinema. It became popular for one man to go against a larger superior force and emerge triumphant. Die Hard if not the progenitor of this genre, it most certainly stands as the prototype. It helped to establish what is possible for the emerging action genre when done right.This film also established the career of Bruce Willis. At the time, he was considered a major risk. He had not had any significant ""breaks"" into film and had an average television career. Through his performance he became a household name and would be propelled into stardom. Mr. Willis was able to capture the ""everyman"" struggling through his life and never giving up.Die Hard also introduced to the world the character actor, Alan Rickman. An actor whose speaking voice comes across solemn and droll. His voice was perfect for conveying the arrogance of Hans Gruber, the film's antagonist. He also has a chance to put his voice talents to use as he is required to use two different accents for the role.The film follows a New York policeman, John McClain (Bruce Willis) who finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time when a group of German terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take control of a skyscraper. The film does a good job of balancing action with McClain's physical and emotional suffering. Over time it has held up as an iconic film of the decade as well as within it's own genre.","1980s , unique trend developed American Cinema . became popular one man go larger superior force emerge triumphant .

Die_Hard,"New York City cop John McClane has flown to Los Angeles to reconcile with his estranged wife, Holly. He arrives on Christmas Eve and heads to Holly's office, where her company's Christmas party is in full swing. Holly does not work for some ordinary company. She works for the Nakatomi Corporation, whose headquarters are located high up in the Nakatomi Plaza skyscraper which is still under construction. In this office there is a vault. In this vault there are bearer bonds worth $640 million. Enter Hans Gruber. He and his heavily-armed goons storm the building, take everybody hostage and set in motion their plan to open that vault and get that money. Only one thing stands in their way: John McClane.McClane is conveniently the only person in the building who manages to escape being taken hostage. He then conveniently manages to stay alive as a whole swarm of well-trained, heavily-armed terrorists continually fires at him with machine guns and attempts to blow him to smithereens with powerful explosives. He makes quite the nuisance of himself, Hans is not pleased. Anyhow, there's a lot of shooting and a lot of things blowing up...and then there's a lot more shooting and a lot more things blowing up...and then...well, you get the picture. It's basically two hours of this on an endless loop. It's an action movie that indeed has lots of action but that action gets repetitive rather quickly. This movie is often described as innovative and revolutionary. That's overselling it by quite some distance. It's an average shoot-'em-up action movie. No more, no less.The best thing the movie has going for it is the talents of its two leads. Bruce Willis plays the hero, Alan Rickman plays the villain and if anything in this movie rises above the level of cliché it is their performances. Willis infuses McClane with some personality, delivering wisecracks which bring a smile to your face. Rickman makes Hans into a rather unique villain, a detestable guy to be sure but one with some serious intelligence and cunning. Unfortunately these two main characters spend very little time actually squaring off with one another, McLane spending the bulk of the movie dealing with a bunch of anonymous bad guys you really don't care about. Supporting characters offer very little support. Aside from McClane and Hans there's not much there. Reginald VelJohnson has a few good moments playing an LAPD officer who comes onto the scene. Unfortunately he is soon overshadowed by a deputy police chief character whose stupidity is just mind-boggling. Any momentum the movie threatens to gather comes to a screeching halt anytime this guy opens his mouth. Then some FBI guys show up and remarkably they're even worse. There's a lot of stupidity outside Nakatomi Plaza. And there aren't enough interesting things happening inside the building. Die Hard is a movie which is considered to be a standout in the action movie genre, a classic. The truth is it's a rather ordinary movie.","New York City cop John McClane flown Los Angeles reconcile estranged wife , Holly . arrives Christmas Eve heads Holly 's office , company 's Christmas party full swing .

Die_Hard,"Die HardOne of the most full-out action movies of all time. It had the best formula, the best dialogue, the best stunts, the best characters, and the best explosions. ""Die Hard.""Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a recently divorced cop who travels to LA for the opening of his wife's new workplace, Nakatomi Plaza, owned by a rich Japanese man. His wife (Bonnie Bedalia) is happy to see McClane come, and we feel that they want to get back together. Perhaps this opening party will do it. But then it happens. As John takes a trip to the bathroom, a gang of terrorists (headed by Alan Rickman) take charge of the company building, demanding money. John hides out in the building and tries to think of a way to get the bad guys. They have no idea that John McClane is loose in the building, and only realize that someone is out there watching them when an elevator shaft is blown to pieces by Willis. Pretty soon, the LAPD, FBI, CIA, and just about anything with three or more letters is outside, and only one man has contact with John McClane from the outside - Reginald VelJohnson, a cop with a walkie-talkie.This is, without a doubt, Bruce Willis' best film. By far. His personality fits the persona of John McClane. It's fun watching him, for once.The formula for this movie is what makes it so great, however. Think about it. A man, trapped in a building with some bad guys; a one man army. The perfect action flick formula. But what makes it even better is the non-stop action and excellent, adrenaline-packed explosions and gunplay. People can criticize this movie for being unrealistic, but everyone needs an escape from reality once and a while. One of my favorite parts is where John grabs a fire hose from the top of the building, ties it around himself, and jumps off the edge of the building, smashing into the outside of the glass. Yes, it is very unrealistic, but I'll be darned if it isn't fun.Reginald VelJohnson, of TV's ""Family Matters,"" is perfect as The Cop on the Outside, having contact with The Man in the Inside. VelJohnson has mainly gotten supporting roles in films over the years. These credits include ""Turner and Hootch,"" ""Die Hard,"" and ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder,"" which was more of a cameo than anything else. Regardless, he is a good actor, and it's too bad his career has been so bad lately that he has had to resort to his old days by re-doing his character from ""Die Hard"" by voicing him in a PC game. It's sad enough when actors resort to videogames, but it's even sadder when video games only want you because of an old character you have played and not because of you, yourself. Of action is your specialty, see ""Die Hard"" as soon as you can. And if you don't like action...well...there's always ""Gods and Generals"" for you!","Die HardOne full-out action movies time . best formula , best dialogue , best stunts , best characters , best explosions . `` Die Hard . `` Bruce Willis plays John McClane , recently divorced cop travels LA opening wife 's new workplace , Nakatomi Plaza , owned rich Japanese man . wife ( Bonnie Bedalia ) happy see McClane come , feel want get back together .

Die_Hard,"Believe it or not, many people are dead serious when they say that Die Hard falls into the category of Christmas films. There actually is some truth to this, but the story itself doesn't really have anything to do with it. Because it's often considered one of the best action movies, the focus is squarely set on that and little attention is payed to the impending holiday, especially with regards to the huge amount of cursing the movie has. For an action movie, I was a little surprised by Die Hard's somewhat long set up. Before things start exploding and bullets start flying everywhere, the storyline has to be laid down through a number of dialogue scenes. The plot centers on John McClane (Bruce Willis), an NYPD cop who is flying to LA in order to clear up some misunderstandings with his wife, Holly, and hopefully get his marriage back on track. He is scheduled to meet her is a big skyscraper owned by the Nakatomi Corporation during a christmas party they're hosting. The holiday is tomorrow, and there's a bunch of people not wanting to miss any excitement. As John and Holly start talking, the building suddenly comes under the control of a group of West German terrorists led by the sophisticated (but also evil) Hans Gruber. Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his associates aren't just your average, run of the mill street thugs, and storm the building with missile launchers, stun grenades, and automatic rifles in their possession. Hans' ultimate objective is to break into the building's vault, which contains over 600 million dollars worth of bonds. John manages to stay undetected when the terrorists start shooting up the party and kill several hostages. He later witnesses Gruber fatally shoot Mr. Takagi (Holly's boss) for refusing to give Gruber access to the money. Even without the code, Hans is determined to break open the vault and assigns a computer nerd to try and find the right pass code. Meanwhile, John wreaks havoc throughout the building and kills several terrorists who Gruber sends after him in order to put his interference to an end. The police eventually form a perimeter around the building, but even a SWAT team is unable to breach the terrorists' defenses. McClane causes more chaos for the terrorists and manages to kill some of them in a huge explosion with plastic explosives, which just serves to irritate Gruber even further. He resorts to having one of John's friends, Ellis, try to talk some sense into him over a walkie talkie, but Gruber kills him too when John refuses to cooperate. In a particularly intense scene, Hans tries to track down John himself, posing as a defenseless hostage who doesn't know where he is. He almost succeeds in killing John after the latter willingly hands him a pistol, but it doesn't have any bullets in it. A subsequent gunfight initiated by the terrorists, trying to rescue their stricken leader, leaves John badly wounded. Meanwhile, outside the building, a cop talks with John on a radio, convincing him he will succeed. The FBI has also showed up and orders the building's power to be shut off, which inadvertently ends up helping the terrorists because it disables the vault doors. Gruber makes ridiculous demands to the FBI outside, saying he will let the hostages live (but not release them) if the cops agree to releasing various terrorists in prisons throughout places such as Northern Ireland and Canada. The FBI lies and says they will do it and send helicopters to evacuate Hans, but they will actually send attack helicopters instead. As the hostages are led to the roof, John makes the sickening discovery that the whole roof is wired to explode in order to kill them. McClane fires his gun wildly into the air, telling the hostages the roof is just one big death zone and they all need to head downstairs. In a terrible twist of irony, a helicopter pilot thinks John is shooting because he's a terrorist, and orders his crew to open fire. John is almost killed by the heli, but Gruber blows the roof to bits and it is destroyed. The hostages are all safe now, except for Holly, who has been personally kidnapped by Gruber after he figures out she is John's spouse. John tapes a pistol to his back, pretends to surrender to Gruber, and shoots him when he lets his guard down. Hans is finally killed after being dropped from a window. With his main adversary finished off and the terrorist threat neutralized, John and his wife leave the devastated building. A reporter tries to gets John's thoughts on the spectacular event, but he's punched by Holly. This is quite a good movie. It's not perfect, but I think it manages to set itself apart from many other action movies because of its main character. Bruce Willis plays a man who is not an unstoppable, (somewhat) mindless killing machine like John Rambo or The Terminator, for example. There's several times in Die Hard where he looks to be in a vulnerable state, and he is nearly killed several times. This helps make his character more believable, because no matter how tough you are, you can still die. Another person who deserves praise (arguably more than Willis) is Alan Rickman, who plays Hans, leader of the terrorists. He is a sly, shrewd, and thoroughly despicable person, with many reluctantly agreeing to call him a human being. He kills several people throughout the movie, but he always has class doing so. Lots of villains in movies are what I call stupid evil, meaning that they're loud and boisterous, thinking that makes them intimidating. Gruber on the other hand rarely needs to raise his voice. He's just simply a psychopath. I also enjoyed how there are several references to older movies throughout this one, but not many. Hans often taunts John on his walkie talkie as he knows he is trying to interfere with his terrorist plans, and calls him a ""cowboy wannabe"", similar to John Wayne. Right before Gruber is killed, he thinks John is really surrendering to him this time, and remarks how he won't be riding into the sunset with Grace Kelly now. In all, Die Hard is a pretty lengthy movie, but it is worth seeing because John McClane is much more believable as a character than your ordinary hero. He's not invincible, and it shows. There's other reasons to watch this, but that's my primary one. I still don't really consider this a christmas movie, however.","Believe , many people dead serious say Die Hard falls category Christmas films . actually truth , story n't really anything .

Thrilling,unexpected,dangerous etc. This is not meant to be ""real"" because this is an action film,not a documentary on terrorism or police work. For non-stop action and just releasing pent up feelings of helplessness. I say more power to films like this.

This surefire Twentieth Century Fox franchise has yielded four sequels, including the latest ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" In the first film, Willis played a 'loose cannon' New York cop visiting California. He had been a member of the NYPD for eleven years when he flies out to see his wife, Holly, who works with a Japanese corporation at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles. He arrives for the Christmas Party, meets Holly, gets into an argument with her and then gets separated from the main party with his wife. Everybody is taken by surprise when a German terrorist and his minions storm the Nakatomi Towers. They take everybody hostage, but they slip up and miss John McClane.

Alan Rickman is able to show that Han has a curt attitude to people whom he did not know and jokey nature with those he knew. Alan Rickman is able to make him out to be somewhat of a suit. He flaunted his knowledge and boast of his education to anybody, but McClane manage to slip from his grip. The film follows his exploits as he slowly engages the German terrorists one by one barefoot to retake the tower while dealing in depth of personal pain. The broken glass on his barefoot can be seen as his Achilles's heel. McClane lacks heroic virtues and qualities like Achilles. He can be explains to be a Byronic hero or Anti-Hero by having similar traits to those who like being arrogant and cynical. He is also cunning and able to adapt. He has a dis-tasted for social institutions and norms when he was at the party. John McClane works better alone than in a crowd. Die Hard gives their hero, a cutting edge from cookie cut heroes. What Die Hard does well is keeping a small scale budget while exporting a big blockbuster result. Most of the movie takes taking place entirely within a few floors of the Nakatomi Plaza. It was one of the first of the limited-space, small cast action films. This formula of putting characters in limited area spawn great sequels in their own right, but also an entirely new sub-division of the action genre. The movie is condensed in a few scenes and areas that get so well know. It simplified in such a way that lets the characters and the action really develop and shine through. While having a few explosion-filled sequences, the movie allows the audience to care for the characters and not feel like disconnected from the story-arch or the depth of the characters portray. The movie takes light-hearted approach to the genre, incorporating many less-than-serious elements and one-liners keeps the movie fun and enjoyable no matter how many times watched through, but it comes with a cost. Sub-characters in the film seem corny, low-intelligent or bad written. The scenes with the LA police for example drag the movie down and slow it down. The film brings in Reginald Vel Johnson playing a role as a cop which doomed the actor to playing cops for the rest of his life. He continues to be type cast to this day. Reginald Vel Johnson's character has a trouble past where he accidentally shot a kid and now wouldn't be able to shot. While they did give some back-story to Reginald Vel Johnson character, most of his lines were bad and his actions in the movie are nearly useless. All the main characters in this film are fairly complex and well written compared to most of the dumb action hero movies of the 1980s. Still the police chief doesn't serve any purpose except for delaying police intervention which would have wrapped the story up faster. Matters would have been more easily solved had the chief acquired an average intelligence. Since the sub-characters took a backseat, the character of McClane and Gruber makes the movie watchable. The sarcastic nature of McClane's character against the whimsical Gruber makes this hero and villain pairing one of the finest in film history. The movie even makes a famous quote out of its hero's swearing mouth that can be still heard today. The language can be harsh and the violence too much but it's a good movie. The plot might seem rudimentary and unoriginal today, but it still one of the first movie with many of the things action movie need to be a success. It's the blueprint to any action movie today.","Die Hard Christmas movie directed John McTiernan 's traditional , still watched year holidays . Die Hard serves alternated holiday movie .

When he arrives at Nakatomi Plaza, he and Holly go into a private bathroom and get into an argument. When Holly leaves to give a speech, thirteen armed terrorists lead by Hans Gruber seize control of the building and take the occupants of the 30th floor, who are the only ones left in the building, hostage.

To this day, there never has been a better screen villain, and it's not because of his evil-ness, its the fact that the man is so normal and just so laid back, its as if he's just attending a business meeting.The action is taut, and despite the fact that the building is huge, it's a very claustrophobic movie, that never lets go of you once we hear the first gunshot.Hilarious in places, very gut wrenching in others, but always thrilling, Die Hard is not only the greatest action movie of all time.In my humble opinion, it's the greatest film ever made.","John McClane cop New York way Los Angeles see family .

Die_Hard,"""Die Hard"" has inspired countless replicas in the decades that have passed since its release. Everything from ""Air Force One"" (""Die Hard on a Plane"") to ""Speed"" (""Die Hard on a Bus"") throughout the 90s and early 2000s drew near direct inspiration from the film.Aside from its influence and near immortal status as to how to create an almost infinitely rewatchable popcorn movie, ""Die Hard"" earns its credit from me for its pacing. The slow buildup of the terrorist takeover, the realization of the outside world of what's going on in the Nakatomi Building, and John McClane (Bruce Willis) slowly taking out bad guys as he unravels the true intentions of the terrorist group.Special props to the cinematography (love the use of Dutch angles in this one) and also the incredible performance of Alan Rickman as the slimy Hans Gruber.","`` Die Hard '' inspired countless replicas decades passed since release .

Die_Hard,"Back in 1968, 20th Century Fox released The Detective. Based on the book by Roderick Thorp and starring Frank Sinatra, the film was quite successful for the studio and Thorp would follow up with a sequel book in 1979 with the story following Sinatra's character named Joe Leland attending a Christmas party with his daughter when a group of German terrorists show up and take over the building. 20th Century Fox had expressed an interest in adapting the book into a film but given that Sinatra was obligated to appear in the film, he would have to be offered the part but with Frank being in his 70s, he turned the role down. There were rumors making the rounds for years that the film was going to be a recycled screenplay for the intended sequel to Commando but that was never the case. With Sinatra out of the picture, it gave them the chance to change the characters and remove the connection to the previous story. WIth Joel Silver producing and having worked with director John McTiernan on Predator, Joel felt he would be the right director to bring Die Hard to life. However, McTiernan didn't like the early drafts of the script and turned the offer down several times and only took the job after being convinced to do it. Feeling the screenplay to be too mean-spirited and wanting to lighten up the film a bit, McTiernan decided to add in humor so that the audience wouldn't despise the villians. John also didn't want the villians to be terrorists ether seeing that direction as too distasteful for a summer blockbuster so he decided to stay away from the terrorists' political views and focus more on them being professional thieves in search of financial gain feeling that this would make Die Hard more appropriate for moviegoers. When it came time to casting the lead for Die Hard, names like Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood were offered the role of John McClane, but both of them turned the role down. Bruce Willis eventually got the role, seeing it as a chance to expand his acting range and do a different kind of film with Die Hard. Shooting began in November of 1987 and finished in March of 1988 with the 20th Cenrty Fox headquarters filling in for Nakatomi Plaza. When the film was released in the summer of 1988, It wasn't well-received by film critics but it still did well at the box office. Over the years, Die Hard has been more warmly received by both critics and the moviegoing public as it's level of filmmaking and storytelling have been given more respect.Now, my experience with Die Hard is next to non-existent as I never had the chance to see it when I was younger and only got around to watching it late last year. Given that I'm a big fan of action films like Raiders of the Lost Ark, a film like Die Hard feels right up my alley. After watching the film, I can certainly saw that Die Hard is easily one of the best action films ever made thanks to it's screenwriting, John McTiernan's solid direction, the performances and it's storytelling qualities. With the current crop of mostly generic action films, Die Hard still stands on its own in the world of action cinema.The film begins with New York police officer John McClane arriving in Los Angeles intending to reconnect with his alienated wife Holly. John is driven to the Nakatomi Plaza to attend a Christmas party and soon meets up with his wife. At first, she is pleased to see him but things quickly turn sour as the tension between them begins to show. As Holly leaves, John gets himself ready for the party. Meanwhile, a gang of professional thieves masquerading as terrorists led by Hans Gruber seize control of the plaza, and only McClane evades capture. Gruber takes Nakatomi executive Joseph Takagi hostage and questions him on the access code to the building's vault but Takagi refuses to cooperate and is killed by Hans. In an attempt to alert the authorities, John gets into a fight with one of Gruber's henchmen and uses his radio to connect the Los Angeles police force. A police sergeant named Al Powell is sent to investigate but finds nothing unusual and prepares to leave but McClane tries to get his attention by throwing one of the dead bodies onto his squad car but this alarms Powell causing him to crash. The rest of the Los Angeles police force arrives on the scene but d nothing to help the situation. Now, John is on his own and must find a way to stop Gruber and save the hostages.In the world of moviemaking, creating the perfect action film that is able to give the viewer an exhilarating thrill-ride while also making them care about the characters onscreen is never an easy task to pull off and every guideline that dictates such actions always has a number of exemptions to this rule. Unlike Rambo and Predator, Die Hard went against all of those rules mostly with the rule of not amping up the action in an effort to have a majority draw. Having shown in Predator that he could handle both captivating sci-fi themes as well as nerve-racking tension, John McTiernan was the right guy to tell the story of a New York policeman facing overwhelming odds and adjust it for the 1980s action crowd and while the movie is nowhere near as explosive as say Comanndo or Rambo III, it nevertheless endures as an appealing and smart action film that doesn't insult or talk down to its audience unlike action movies like Transformers: Age of Extinction or Robocop 3.Nowadays, action movies like Skyscraper, A Good Day To Die Hard, and the Fast and the Furious movies have become identified with idiotic and cheesy dialog, cardboard characters, redundant storytelling, and horribly shot action scenes that it's now easy for audiences to forget the brilliance and improvements directors like McTiernan, Cameron, and Spielberg brought to the genre. Die Hard was such a revelation in the action film genre during the '80s that for the next half-decade, moviegoers were treated to a multitude of Die Hard clones from Speed to Under Siege. Even if people can't agree with each other on whether or not Die Hard is a Christmas film, it's still incredible that John McTiernan's 1988 action classic still stands tall amongst many other 80s action films. Like Nakatomi Plaza, the film seems to dwarf most of the competition and it's not because Die Hard does anything particularly new or interesting with the action film genre but merely because the film uses all the conventions and cliches of action films extremely well as well as not treating its story beats as mere check-list items.It's not hard to see Die Hard as a Sylvester Stallone film in some ways. If the film was released in an alternative reality with Stallone as the lead, it would just another run-of-the-mill 80s action with tons of explosions and gun battles but with generic stock characters and a lack of tension and would have been forgotten by all but the most die-hard 80s action film fans. Sure, the makings of the film are fairly simple with a police officer trying to make amends with his wife, a British villain, a situation where people are being held hostage, explosions out the ass, and the usual confrontation between the hero and villain. If Hollywood made cookbooks for making a mainstream action film, all of them would say that directors and writers should use the basic ingredients of filmmaking when making an action film. Now, if a lesser director and a lesser cast of actors tried doing a film like Die Hard with a lesser screenplay, it would feel forced with cliched plot points one would have to check off before enjoying the gun battles, explosions, and all the predictable action film troupes moviegoers pay to see.Judiciously, Die Hard does work as a film because unlike a film like Speed 2: Cruise Control or Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever, Die Hard actually is interested in what is happening to the characters. Despite this not being essential for a solid action film, there's really no sense of responsibility. John McClane's vacation to Los Angeles to reconnect with his family isn't just used as a plot point to get us to the action scenes or to try to make us at least feel some sort of sympathy for him, it feels much more steadfast on its own terms because we are given time to see John and his wife interact with each other and see why their marriage is on the rocks. It's the small things that make the opening sequence work like John not knowing what to get his kids for Christmas or his fear of flying. In a way, these moments may feel like they belong in a bad family melodrama but with Steven E. de Souza's witing and McTiernan's directing, they feel more genuine and heartfelt and therefore make the film all the more wonderful.That now brings us to the hero of this film: John McClane. In the world of action films, John McClane isn't your stereotypical tough guy. He's not an invincible killing machine unlike say Rambo or John Matrix from Comanndo but rather an ordinary cop from New York and to some, an icon of 80s' masculinity. He's uncouth, hostile, unsympathetic, and aggressive. He's never without a cigarette in his mouth. He's scornful for any sort of advance and even a bit sexist. He's estranged from his wife, suffers from jet lag, and is stuck in a scenario he's not comfortable with. Despite these faults, John is still a good-hearted person and is devoted to his job and wants to help people and do the right thing, but his personal life as well as his relationship with his wife is a hassle for him to manage, thus showing that he's more focused on his job than he is on his family. This makes the character incredibly relatable to so many people. John's masculinity is one of the core themes of the story. Hans Gruber continually compares McClane to a cowboy. John's heroism inside Nakatomi Plaza is mismatched with the more in your face mockeries of 80s' machismo such as the coked-up white-collared worker Ellis whose snobbish and degrading manner towards Hans is what gets him killed and endangers McClane considerably.

Once the action starts it's thrill a minute stuff as we watch Maclane trying to sabotage their plan against impossible odds. Some fabulous action scenes including a now iconic shot involving a fire hose as fall arrest equipment! The action and high tension is punctuated by fabulous snappy dialogue between McLane and chief villain Hans Gruber played superbly by Alan Rickman. Still packs a punch over 30 years after its release.

Die_Hard,"I've never understood the rampant admiration for this movie. As far as inane American action films go, it's barely even amongst the better ones- let alone a classic. Every single character is a walking cliche, complete with corny Bond villains, arrogant cops, witty black chauffeur and swooning love interest. Bruce Willis is uninteresting and arguably a little irritating while Alan Rickman simply deserves better than this awful writing. The amount of plot armour that Willis is given takes all the suspense out of the film and makes it a rather arduous experience. I have no problem with this genre of movie but Die Hard lacks the atmosphere of The Terminator or the charm of Raiders of The Lost Ark.

Die_Hard,"In stepped John McTiernan and Bruce Willis with Die Hard. Willis, most famous at the time for the comic TV Series 'Moonlighting', made a perfect ordinary-man-in-an-extraordinary-situation action hero. He was believable as John McClane and not immune to being hurt. He bled and felt pain, a first for the genre. And yet his cool confident delivery of a great wisecracking, intelligent script made him all the cooler. But most credit should go to Director John McTiernan, king of the sophisticated action flick. He made action movies slick, smart and full of pace and wit while never letting up on the bullets, cars and bombs front. Special praise must go out to Alan Rickman too whose performance as chief baddie Hans is to this day one of cinemas finest, moving convincingly from cool, calm and collected to desperate and nervous, never once seeming anything less than utterly ruthless and calculating. Even after we discover that Hans isn't there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no villain credibility when he responds to Holly McClane's criticism by saying ""I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving to kidnapping you should be more polite."" Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end. His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as quite a gentleman outside of the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard's arc. In the end though, Hans is a pure sociopath that even the audience is conned into sympathizing with. I would actually argue that Die Hard is the greatest pure action film ever made. Yippie-ki-yay *muddy funster*... and happy holidays.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.","stepped John McTiernan Bruce Willis Die Hard .

Die_Hard,"Seeing 'Die Hard' for the first time as a teenager was a one-of-a-kind experience. This level of raw, ""edge-of-your-seat"" action was unknown to me prior to this film; it made my head spin and the intensity of it was nearly unbearable. When it was over, I could only think of one word: Wow!For a long time - at least in western cinema - the only ""true"" action movies (by that I mean films that were all about the action and you went to see them because of the action) were the 'James Bond' movies. They had the most unreal stunts and crazy, over the top action sequences that you could imagine at the time, and they were (and still are) great fun. However, they usually lacked three vital ingredients:1. A sense of realism (meaning: the hero is only human and can get hurt)2. Grit (messy, unpolished action, dirty people and LOTS of swearing)3. R-rated violence (showing the audience what real weapons do to the human body)Well, it took John McTiernan to bring those three key elements together in 'Die Hard' - and thus the modern action film was born (it had a good run through the late eighties until the end of the nineties – then the studios figured out they could maximise the box-office by taming down the swearing, violence and sex and thus, alas, the contemporary, toothless PG-13 action film was born). Sure, there have been a couple of others before McTiernan's masterpiece ('First Blood', 'Terminator', 'Predator' - which was also by McTiernan - or 'Lethal Weapon' and probably some more), but those films could have fallen into any number of other categories as well ('Adventure-/Survival-/War-', 'Sci- Fi', 'Horror-' or 'Buddy-movie') – and I can't think of another film that was just such a relentless, pure-action-from-the-beginning-to-the-end film as was 'Die Hard'. To me, it's the ultimate thrill ride. The formula has since been repeated so many times, but the original still sets the standard by which I judge an action film.

Godzilla_Minus_One,"A kamikaze pilot lands on Odo island in the final days of WWII, the bomb strapped to the bottom of his plane barely staying above the rocks peppered across the runway. Something is wrong with his vehicle, which is why he has diverted from his destination and hasn't been able to ""die honourably""... or so he says. The mechanics can't find any faults with the aircraft, and the pilot's shaking hands do little to assuage their suspicions that he may have just been too ""cowardly"" to do his duty. Lost in his own thoughts, perched by the sea which laps at the ground near his feet, the pilot is approached by a young worker who tells him Japan needs more people like him. Before he can contemplate believing the man, he notices several deep sea fish floating belly up to the surface. How strange. As night falls, he returns to the nearby barracks. But there's a strange noise nearby, and nobody is prepared for what's making it. A watchtower turns it's light to the beach, where a hulking prehistoric monster is revealed in its light. Godzilla is here, and he isn't happy.So begins 'Godzilla Minus One (2023)', the latest in a long line of monster movies starring cinema's foremost Kaiju. The picture acts as a prequel to the previous Japanese 'Godzilla' films, although it's unclear if it also acts as something of a reboot, and - as you can tell from my description of the unconventional first scene - it also instantly takes things back to basics to much more closely emulate the original picture than its bevy of sequels or American remakes (including the on-going Monsterverse series). This Godzilla isn't a hero, he's a monster - or, perhaps, malevolent god - through and through. He isn't misunderstood, he doesn't go toe to toe with any other gigantic creatures, he isn't the unsung saviour of humanity, he's just big and mean and entirely uninterested in altering his path simply to avoid the destruction of entire cities and the deaths of thousands of people. What's more, he isn't the main character, and I can't stress enough how big of a deal that is. He isn't actually in the narrative all that much, and the human drama that drives the experience exists independently of him (although it obviously involves him in a significant way). The protagonist spends the piece wrestling with his self-perceived cowardice, his inability to do what was needed and therefore save lives. He isn't so much working to overcome a giant monster as he is working to overcome his own demons - primarily guilt - and allowing himself to live, to fully live, once more. It's a compelling arc that seamlessly weaves into the picture's rudimentary yet effective examination of the political landscape of post-war Japan. Much like the original 'Godzilla (1954)', the film is a reaction to the palpable terror felt at due to the threat of nuclear holocaust that would hang over the country - and the entire world - for decades to come. It also looks at how poorly Japan treated its soldiers and workers during the war and, while it never actually shows any US forces, it also looks at the struggles that the country endured during its American occupation. When push comes to shove, the only people who can save Japan from Godzilla's wrath are a band of scientists, engineers and mine-clearing sailors. America will not intervene for fear of provoking the Soviet Union with a military manoeuvre, whereas the Japanese government will not intervene because it refuses to take responsibility for the situation. The workers have to take things into their own hands, and - although it has a definite sense of national pride to it - the flick shows no love for neither the government (pre nor post war) nor the military. The feature's subtext and fairly nuanced character arcs are fairly unexpected considering that the few 'Godzilla' movies I've actually seen (the modern American ones) are mostly just mindless smash-'em-ups with weak human plots that come secondary to the weirdly weightless MUTO mayhem. Here, the human drama is what keeps you watching, not the promise of creature-feature devastation, and it's really compelling. It's perhaps the main reason why the disastrous set-pieces work as well as they do.That's not to imply that those sequences aren't everything you'd hope them to be. When the deep-sea destroyer returns after his post-prologue hiatus, he's much larger, much more powerful and much more ferocious. Powered-up by the USA's use of nuclear weaponry in and around Japan, he sets out on a collision course for Tokyo and doesn't stop until he's wreaked havoc on land. Backed by Akira Ifukube's monumental original score (arranged by Naoki Sato in various progressions used in some of the early sequels), the big bad lumbers around with a permanent scowl and an evil glaze over his unblinking eyes. Designed so that his movements resemble the suitmation used in the first film, his presence is tactile and utterly believable (the CGI is fantastic). Purposefully limiting his motion to resemble a man in a suit doesn't dampen his power, it just compounds the fact that he moves like that. His footsteps shake the earth (literally crush it in some cases), his tail whips through the landscape, his jaws crush whatever comes between them and his iconic roar tears through the sky. Don't even get me started on his atomic breath, which powers up with an ominous drone as the sharp spines on his back extend one by one, then shoots out in a short, sharp burst of bright blue fury and detonates a literal nuclear explosion that eviscerates anything in its radius and still triggers devastating shockwaves and skin-burning acid rain. It's horrific, legitimately scary stuff. Godzilla is as mean as he's ever been, and his violence truly is harrowing. You don't cheer for him, you fear him. That's what really stands out about this version, at least to me. I often found myself with my mouth hanging open, my palms beginning to sweat as a pit formed in my stomach. People die. A body count is explicitly mentioned in the aftermath of Godzilla's mid-movie attack, and we spend time with the collective grief such death causes. As the exciting finale approaches, the heroes' determination that no-one else is going to die seems like it must be in vain. How can mere morals defeat this force of nature?But there is hope. There's always hope. If the people of Japan can rebuild their country in the wake of war, they can surely rebuild it in the wake of this. After all, they have to. That is to say that the feature always retains an underlying optimism, something that perhaps gives you a hint towards its eventual predictability. No matter how conventional it eventually becomes, it always remains utterly compelling and entirely satisfying because it has laid the foundations to get you fully invested in its story. It does everything so very well that you're happy to overlook its few flaws, including its slightly baggy pacing and its occasionally heavy-handed flag-waving. It's a really enjoyable experience that inspires a whole bevy of emotions. It's the best monster movie I've seen in a long time.","kamikaze pilot lands Odo island final days WWII , bomb strapped bottom plane barely staying rocks peppered across runway .

I am getting a tattoo of the poster for Godzilla vs King Ghidorah in a couple of weeks.

And make no mistake, Legendary is full of fans that know the formula, and follow it to a T. The results have been nothing but i enjoyable and fun.The problem here is, Toho has decided to create a new and better formula. This, is not a great Kaiju film, it's a great film. It deals with all kinds of heavy emotional territory, survivor's guilt, loss, PTSD, personal redemption, duty.... The film is a HARD tear-jerker. You heard me right, a Godzilla film that will wring tears out of anyone short of corpse status. Godzilla itself is returned to the roots, a force of nature, an analogy for the atomic bomb, it cares not about good or evil, it kills both with as much thought, none.There have been hints from Toho over the decades that they were and could be smarter than their reputation, the Cold War paranoia of Matango, the original Godzilla, the environmental message of Godzilla vs the Smog Monster, but this....

Godzilla_Minus_One,"""Godzilla Minus One"" is the 37th film in the Godzilla franchise and Toho's 33rd film overall. Written and directed Takashi Yamazaki and starring Ryunosuke Kamiki in the lead role, it pulls off the near impossible task of balancing harrowing human drama with that signature Godzilla mass destruction.In 1946 in Japan, kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) returns home to a ruined Tokyo after failing to stop the giant lizard-like monster Godzilla from killing the inhabitants of Odo Island. Still overcome with guilt, Koichi takes up a job as a minesweeper to support himself, as well as a homeless woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and the orphaned baby Akiko she rescued. Meanwhile, Godzilla has become more mutated and powerful as a result of America's nuclear tests in Bikini Atoll, and is now heading directly towards Japan. One year later, Koichi and his crew are given the task of preventing Godzilla from reaching the Japanese mainland, and despite some initial success, Godzilla quickly breaks through their blockade. Upon making landfall, Godzilla unleashes a fury of destruction on the city of Ginza, killing tens of thousands of people in the process. Shocked by the carnage left in its wake, Koichi vows revenge against Godzilla and soon find himself working on a plan to take out the gargantuan monster once and for all.If there were ever a more iconic giant movie monster that didn't come from Hollywood, it would have to be Godzilla of course. For almost seven decades, this colossal reptilian has stomped its way through cities around the world and battled other large monsters (""Kaijus"") of similar size using its physical strength and atomic breath. But what many may not know is the real reason why Godzilla was created at all, and that was for it to serve as an allegory for the misuse of nuclear weapons post-World War II. This metaphor is at the forefront of the 2023 film ""Godzilla Minus One"", which not only features some clever social commentary regarding Japan's future in the nuclear age, but also a lineup of well-written characters and great special effects to help things along nicely.Separating itself considerably from most other movies of its type, this film actually has a three-dimensional human protagonist for the audience to support. Our hero Koichi is World War II kamikaze pilot, whose job was to fly his plane into the enemy, killing himself in the process. However, Koichi cannot bring himself to go through with this literal suicide mission and upon returning home is labelled as a dishonourable coward by those around him. Throughout the film, we see Koichi experiencing survivor's guilt due to him being indirectly responsible for many deaths at the hands of Godzilla, and he finds himself in constant conflict with his emotions.A set-up like this is particularly interesting, because it shows a unique perspective of what the Japanese perceive as courageous. In their culture, the Japanese believe that surrendering to an enemy victory is an act of cowardice, so in addition to his PTSD of letting others die, Koichi also has the burden of his country's high expectations to once again prove himself worthy to their cause. By watching Koichi work desperately to overcome both his guilt and shame, we see him grow as a person over the course of the film, allowing for a rather in-depth character arc that is not usually seen to this extent in giant monster movies. Because of this, the audience now has a believable, sympathetic main character for them to cheer for against all opposition.Something else worth mentioning here is that it is not just Koichi who has a lot to benefit from growing throughout the story, but also the plethora of supporting characters he comes into contact with. For instance, many of Koichi's minesweeper crew are former members of the Japanese navy, who are each trying to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of their country's bitter defeat in World War II. One crew member never even had the chance to see combat but still wants to help out wherever he can. With so much to prove after losing the War, all of these brave men work tirelessly around the clock to protect their homeland from an outside threat, only this time from a giant lizard creature instead of a global superpower. I couldn't help but admire the sense of public duty each of these men have for their country, which is not often seen outside of a typical war film, and watching it demonstrated so effectively in Godzilla movie of all things is nothing short of impressive.Of course, aside from all these heavy-handed themes and character motivations, it just wouldn't be a Godzilla film without what everyone pays to see in the first place - the chaos and destruction. For any doubters, there are still plenty of scenes of the iconic monster crashing its way through buildings, biting into warships like they were food, and blasting away large areas with its signature atomic breath. It's worth noting that this Godzilla is a bit smaller than other incarnations, as it still relatively young and hasn't yet grown to full size. Despite that, I still really liked Godzilla's design and the film's special effects used to bring it to life. Essentially, Godzilla is treated like a force of nature acting on its youthful animalistic instincts rather than as a calculating villain, with anyone or anything in its path likely to meet an untimely end.As the film takes place just after World War II, the human weaponry to fight back against Godzilla is exclusively limited to that particular time period, with no modern day artillery available at their dispersal. To make matters worse, despite being responsible for its creation, the Americans refuse to assist Japan in stopping Godzilla at the risk of causing tension with the nearby Soviet Union. This leaves Japan with no other choice but to fight Godzilla all by themselves, with only their intellect and home field advantage as their aces in the hole. Because of that, you really get the sense that the Japanese are the underdogs in this fight, exacerbated by the fact that they are still in the process of rebuilding their country after World War II.For a character like Koichi, Ryunosuke Kamiki brings an appropriate level of dimension to his performance in the main role. As mentioned earlier, Koichi is not just battling Godzilla, he is also grappling with his own inner turmoil. Often times he is haunted by his past mistakes and the longing to fix them before he completely loses his mind. Kamiki does a great job showing the array of emotions Koichi is going through, ranging from reserved shame for his past actions to intense anger for what Godzilla has done to those he cares about. He holds a personal vendetta against Godzilla, and like Captain Ahab hunting Moby Dick, he becomes obsessed with destroying the giant Kaiju as a way to achieve peace of mind. Watching Koichi develop throughout the story is one of the film's biggest strengths, and it is balanced out near-flawlessly with the usual scenes of Godzilla destroying things.From the viewpoint of a casual fan, ""Godzilla Minus One"" ranks among the most entertaining and emotionally deep monster movies ever made. Having only watched a handful of movies in the series, I have to admit it's quite refreshing to find one this well-made with likeable, interesting human characters in addition to everything else one would expect. To my surprise, this movie was made on a budget of less than $15 million, far lower than most of the Hollywood features rushed out to theatres these days. Western movie studios should take note because this is clearly how action films should be made instead of the same over-produced and over-priced content they continue to churn out every year. After all, if the Japanese can do it, then surely the west can follow suit.I rate it a solid 9/10.","`` Godzilla Minus One '' 37th film Godzilla franchise Toho 's 33rd film overall .

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Man, I've been looking forward to this one! In the wake of a struggling American cinema, Japan graces us with a brand-new kaiju film that shockingly impressed Western audiences left and right. That, folks, is ""Godzilla Minus One"".Plot: A few years after WW2, disgraced kamikaze pilot Shikishima struggles to settle down with his new family and friends. However, a ghost from the past has returned to haunt him as well as the nation, the saurian Godzilla, mutated by nuclear radiation. As the monster vents his rage and plunges Japan in despair, Shikishima and his cohorts face their inner demons and unite to defend their homeland when no one else could.This film is cinematic in every possible way. The story tackles the trauma the Japanese people had to deal with after the war head-on: failures on top of a crippling defeat, personal loss, government failings, and economic decline. Shikishima is a great protagonist, wracked with guilt to the point of reoccurring nightmares yet deep down wants to make amends and help those close to him towards a brighter future, helped by his lovable bunch of companions with their own distinct personalities and insecurities who also served during the war. The drama and interpersonal conflicts are powerful, really making you feel their turmoil, so much so that even when the monster isn't around for a long stretch, they keep you engaged (I actually heard someone in the audience crying from such scenes!). All this serves to emphasize the theme of living and rebuilding after such harrowing times.As for Godzilla, he's presented as an aggressive territorial animal. He feels huge yet personal, his mere presence spine-chilling and power very impactful. This is helped by haunting music (though you still get the classic theme) and equally scary imagery and hard-hitting violence (not overtly bloody, mind you, but enough to leave an impression). There were even moments where it felt like ""Jaws"" in a good way. The times when he uses his atomic breath alone are straight up jaw-dropping. The army's battles with the kaiju are also done well, a good amount of destruction and utter fear, with a climax that's creative in its concept and execution. All this spectacle is done with excellent special effects despite being a fraction of the usual American budget these days; I could practically count every scale on Big G.All in all, ""Godzilla Minus One"" is a must-see that is well-deserved of the large amount of praise it's getting. Not only does it present the monster in a scary light that borders on horror, but it also has human characters that keep your attention, not to mention great music, effects, action, and story.

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Godzilla Minus One doesn't even need Godzilla to succeed. Takashi Yamazaki's film is set in post World War II Japan, following a failed kamikaze pilot haunted by trauma and guilt, which manifests in the form of a destructive behemoth from the sea. The film stars Minami Hamabe and Kamiki Ryunosuke.The film is at its peak when it's a character study of a devastated Japan. Outside of the action scenes with Godzilla, the other half of the film is balanced well with compelling characters. Even with English subtitles, American audiences feel the emotional weight and turmoil of the actors' performances as their characters navigate the reconstruction of their lives. While I expected an epic action film, I was completely surprised by a poignant character-driven story. Showing the many conflicting viewpoints of the Japanese people through its characters, the film ultimately argues against the senseless loss of human life that was seen during WWII.Godzilla can be perceived as a symbol of death and destruction as the film brings the iconic reptilian monster back to its roots, unlike many of the recent American Godzilla films. Presented as a force of nature, Godzilla shows no remorse as it crushes people and buildings. Right as the struggles that the characters face seem to be coming to a resolution, Godzilla steps in with its atomic breath, a clear allegory for the atomic bomb and its destructive power. Since strong characters are established, the audience actually feels sadness when Godzilla mows through civilization.While the film had a tiny budget of 15 million dollars (compare that to Godzilla vs. Kong's nearly 200 million dollar budget), the visual effects were still effective. Though there were a few shaky shots, Godzilla's monstrous size came across nicely, creating thrilling action scenes. These action scenes were elevated further by the sturdy emotional core of the film.It should be noted that the film's back half wasn't nearly as compelling as its first half. The first hour of the film had a well balanced mix of action and drama. Unfortunately, the action takes a backseat during the last hour and the drama doesn't pack as much of a punch. The film also doesn't fully commit to some of its plot points, lessening the impact of some heartbreaking character moments. But, the film does eventually reach an explosively satisfying conclusion.Oddly, some may take issue with the film's inclusion of Godzilla. The character study aspect does stand on its own two feet and could've been made even better if it were solely focused on. Then again, a story about a pilot overcoming his guilt and creating a family wouldn't bring as big of an audience to theaters. In my opinion, Godzilla isn't totally unnecessary as its presence reinforces the film's messaging and metaphors.Godzilla Minus One not only succeeds at reinvigorating the terror in Godzilla but it also serves as a gripping presentation of a country pulling together to rebuild a past life. The synthesis of heart and action creates one of, if not the best, monster-centered action films.","Godzilla Minus One n't even need Godzilla succeed .

I never thought I'd see a Godzilla movie where people were crying in the theater. It was quite the experience.

Godzilla_Minus_One,"The BankofMarquis just viewed one of the most entertaining films of 2023 - and it's a GODZILLA film.Yes, a GODZILLA film.From famed Japanese Studio Toho, makers of the original Godzilla film from the 1950's plus other ""man in a rubber suit"" monster movies like MOTHRA and WAR OF THE GARGANTUANS, Godzilla Minus One subverts the genre for a moment for instead of presenting a ""Monster stomping on buildings"" movie with some people in the background, this film is about the Japanese people and how they deal with the aftermath of World War II while (also) running from a giant monster stomping on buildings - but the monster story is the ""B"" story and the people story is the ""A"" story...and this subversion of the genre works very very well.The title of the film, Godzilla Minus One, refers to the fact that...after World War II.... Japan was ""starting from zero"". When Godzilla starts attacking, it knocks Japan back another peg, hence...Godzilla Minus One.Director and Screenwriter Takashi Yamazaki tells the tale of Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki) who encounters Godzilla towards the end of WWII and freezes, causing the death of his fellow soldiers (so his PTSD continues to tell him throughout the film). Once back in Japan, he encounters a young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe) who has been left orphaned, homeless and alone and is sheparding an abandoned baby. This unlikely trio form a bond...and a home...while trying to rebuild their lives and (in Koichi's case) tries to make sense of the devastation he encountered in the war.Into to this rebuilding stomps Godzilla.This story is effectively told by Yamazaki, who knows when to focus on the people aspect of the film and when to focus on the building stomping of Godzilla. It's a delicate balance that is helped by the performances of Kamiki and Hamabe...and the special effects that brings the spirit of the 1950's and 1960's Toho monster films to light.A surpwisingly rich entertainment, Godzilla Minus One will entertain you with monster stomping...and deep human emotion.Letter Grade: A- (I'm as surprised as you are)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","BankofMarquis viewed one entertaining films 2023 - 's GODZILLA film.Yes , GODZILLA film.From famed Japanese Studio Toho , makers original Godzilla film 1950 's plus `` man rubber suit '' monster movies like MOTHRA WAR GARGANTUANS , Godzilla Minus One subverts genre moment instead presenting `` Monster stomping buildings '' movie people background , film Japanese people deal aftermath World War II ( also ) running giant monster stomping buildings - monster story `` B '' story people story `` '' story ... subversion genre works well.The title film , Godzilla Minus One , refers fact ...

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Godzilla Minus One is virtually perfect, just as good as everyone is saying it is.Minus One is essentially a remake of the original Godzilla. Even the science fantasy plan to destroy the monster is a variation on the plan from the original, albeit somewhat less silly. Also like the original, a thematic focus of Minus One is the collective trauma which immediately follows a catastrophe. Interestingly, rather than staging the atomic bombs as the backdrop of that trauma, as in the original Godzilla, the trauma here, and in fact the physical setting in the first part of the movie, is Tokyo after the notorious fire bombing by the United States.Into the collective and immediate trauma, Minus One folds the post-traumatic trauma of its main protagonist, while also playing on the theme of redemption. The motivation behind this character's trauma is the conflict between that expectation of fulfilling one's duty that is so particular to Japanese culture, particularly WWII military culture, and specifically the duty to die expected of kamikaze pilots.If all of that seems rather intense for a ""mere"" monster movie, well, there is nothing ""mere"" about this flick. All of that depth is perfectly delivered through excellent acting from top to bottom (I teared up twice during this movie, something I have never done watching a kaiju), genuine character development, even among secondary characters, and impeccable direction. The choice of camera distance from characters, camera placement and angles, and the judicious use of slow motion, all contribute to that depth, too. Regarding slow motion: I generally hate it because it is so rarely used effectively and so often used in a cheesy, eye rolling way. As much as I love the Lord of the Rings trilogy, there are only one or two moments across all 11 and 1/2 hours that were made more effective through slow motion. The rest of those slow mo moments are the weakest shots in the entire trilogy. The exact opposite is the case here. Somehow, director Takashi Yamazaki uses slow motion several times with each moment being effective and affecting. One particularly brilliant use of slow motion combines it with screen silence. Yamazaki pulls out all the stops.The score is equally compelling. During some sequences, it's almost creepy, certainly atmospheric in a very non-action movie kind of way. It lends those moments a gravitas completely lacking in the blaring, heavy-handed scores of every American Godzilla movie. Composer Naoki Sato even works in Akira Ifukube's famous, doomy leitmotif, but does so sparingly. His score is as impeccable as Yamazaki's directing.Finally, the special effects. Unlike the cartoonish, glowy, neon CG of the American Godzilla movies of the last 10 years or so, Minus One's monster is naturalistic. It looks like an animal be it a horrifying, almost supernatural one. Similarly, the buildings and their destruction is less spectacle and more catastrophic devastation, more appropriately reflecting the damage done by the fire bombing and the atomic bombs.I don't often write such long reviews, but this movie knocked my socks off. I will buy it when it's available on disc, also not something I often do with newer movies.","Godzilla Minus One virtually perfect , good everyone saying is.Minus One essentially remake original Godzilla .

Godzilla_Minus_One,"""Godzilla Minus One"" is the 37th film in the Godzilla franchise and Toho's 33rd film overall. Written and directed Takashi Yamazaki and starring Ryunosuke Kamiki in the lead role, it pulls off the near impossible task of balancing harrowing human drama with that signature Godzilla mass destruction.In 1946 in Japan, kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) returns home to a ruined Tokyo after failing to stop the giant lizard-like monster Godzilla from killing the inhabitants of Odo Island. Still overcome with guilt, Koichi takes up a job as a minesweeper to support himself, as well as a homeless woman named Noriko (Minami Hamabe) and the orphaned baby Akiko she rescued. Meanwhile, Godzilla has become more mutated and powerful as a result of America's nuclear tests in Bikini Atoll, and is now heading directly towards Japan. One year later, Koichi and his crew are given the task of preventing Godzilla from reaching the Japanese mainland, and despite some initial success, Godzilla quickly breaks through their blockade. Upon making landfall, Godzilla unleashes a fury of destruction on the city of Ginza, killing tens of thousands of people in the process. Shocked by the carnage left in its wake, Koichi vows revenge against Godzilla and soon find himself working on a plan to take out the gargantuan monster once and for all.If there were ever a more iconic giant movie monster that didn't come from Hollywood, it would have to be Godzilla of course. For almost seven decades, this colossal reptilian has stomped its way through cities around the world and battled other large monsters (""Kaijus"") of similar size using its physical strength and atomic breath. But what many may not know is the real reason why Godzilla was created at all, and that was for it to serve as an allegory for the misuse of nuclear weapons post-World War II. This metaphor is at the forefront of the 2023 film ""Godzilla Minus One"", which not only features some clever social commentary regarding Japan's future in the nuclear age, but also a lineup of well-written characters and great special effects to help things along nicely.Separating itself considerably from most other movies of its type, this film actually has a three-dimensional human protagonist for the audience to support. Our hero Koichi is World War II kamikaze pilot, whose job was to fly his plane into the enemy, killing himself in the process. However, Koichi cannot bring himself to go through with this literal suicide mission and upon returning home is labelled as a dishonourable coward by those around him. Throughout the film, we see Koichi experiencing survivor's guilt due to him being indirectly responsible for many deaths at the hands of Godzilla, and he finds himself in constant conflict with his emotions.A set-up like this is particularly interesting, because it shows a unique perspective of what the Japanese perceive as courageous. In their culture, the Japanese believe that surrendering to an enemy victory is an act of cowardice, so in addition to his PTSD of letting others die, Koichi also has the burden of his country's high expectations to once again prove himself worthy to their cause. By watching Koichi work desperately to overcome both his guilt and shame, we see him grow as a person over the course of the film, allowing for a rather in-depth character arc that is not usually seen to this extent in giant monster movies. Because of this, the audience now has a believable, sympathetic main character for them to cheer for against all opposition.Something else worth mentioning here is that it is not just Koichi who has a lot to benefit from growing throughout the story, but also the plethora of supporting characters he comes into contact with. For instance, many of Koichi's minesweeper crew are former members of the Japanese navy, who are each trying to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of their country's bitter defeat in World War II. One crew member never even had the chance to see combat but still wants to help out wherever he can. With so much to prove after losing the War, all of these brave men work tirelessly around the clock to protect their homeland from an outside threat, only this time from a giant lizard creature instead of a global superpower. I couldn't help but admire the sense of public duty each of these men have for their country, which is not often seen outside of a typical war film, and watching it demonstrated so effectively in Godzilla movie of all things is nothing short of impressive.Of course, aside from all these heavy-handed themes and character motivations, it just wouldn't be a Godzilla film without what everyone pays to see in the first place - the chaos and destruction. For any doubters, there are still plenty of scenes of the iconic monster crashing its way through buildings, biting into warships like they were food, and blasting away large areas with its signature atomic breath. It's worth noting that this Godzilla is a bit smaller than other incarnations, as it still relatively young and hasn't yet grown to full size. Despite that, I still really liked Godzilla's design and the film's special effects used to bring it to life. Essentially, Godzilla is treated like a force of nature acting on its youthful animalistic instincts rather than as a calculating villain, with anyone or anything in its path likely to meet an untimely end.As the film takes place just after World War II, the human weaponry to fight back against Godzilla is exclusively limited to that particular time period, with no modern day artillery available at their dispersal. To make matters worse, despite being responsible for its creation, the Americans refuse to assist Japan in stopping Godzilla at the risk of causing tension with the nearby Soviet Union. This leaves Japan with no other choice but to fight Godzilla all by themselves, with only their intellect and home field advantage as their aces in the hole. Because of that, you really get the sense that the Japanese are the underdogs in this fight, exacerbated by the fact that they are still in the process of rebuilding their country after World War II.For a character like Koichi, Ryunosuke Kamiki brings an appropriate level of dimension to his performance in the main role. As mentioned earlier, Koichi is not just battling Godzilla, he is also grappling with his own inner turmoil. Often times he is haunted by his past mistakes and the longing to fix them before he completely loses his mind. Kamiki does a great job showing the array of emotions Koichi is going through, ranging from reserved shame for his past actions to intense anger for what Godzilla has done to those he cares about. He holds a personal vendetta against Godzilla, and like Captain Ahab hunting Moby Dick, he becomes obsessed with destroying the giant Kaiju as a way to achieve peace of mind. Watching Koichi develop throughout the story is one of the film's biggest strengths, and it is balanced out near-flawlessly with the usual scenes of Godzilla destroying things.From the viewpoint of a casual fan, ""Godzilla Minus One"" ranks among the most entertaining and emotionally deep monster movies ever made. Having only watched a handful of movies in the series, I have to admit it's quite refreshing to find one this well-made with likeable, interesting human characters in addition to everything else one would expect. To my surprise, this movie was made on a budget of less than $15 million, far lower than most of the Hollywood features rushed out to theatres these days. Western movie studios should take note because this is clearly how action films should be made instead of the same over-produced and over-priced content they continue to churn out every year. After all, if the Japanese can do it, then surely the west can follow suit.I rate it a solid 9/10.","`` Godzilla Minus One '' 37th film Godzilla franchise Toho 's 33rd film overall .

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Man, I've been looking forward to this one! In the wake of a struggling American cinema, Japan graces us with a brand-new kaiju film that shockingly impressed Western audiences left and right. That, folks, is ""Godzilla Minus One"".Plot: A few years after WW2, disgraced kamikaze pilot Shikishima struggles to settle down with his new family and friends. However, a ghost from the past has returned to haunt him as well as the nation, the saurian Godzilla, mutated by nuclear radiation. As the monster vents his rage and plunges Japan in despair, Shikishima and his cohorts face their inner demons and unite to defend their homeland when no one else could.This film is cinematic in every possible way. The story tackles the trauma the Japanese people had to deal with after the war head-on: failures on top of a crippling defeat, personal loss, government failings, and economic decline. Shikishima is a great protagonist, wracked with guilt to the point of reoccurring nightmares yet deep down wants to make amends and help those close to him towards a brighter future, helped by his lovable bunch of companions with their own distinct personalities and insecurities who also served during the war. The drama and interpersonal conflicts are powerful, really making you feel their turmoil, so much so that even when the monster isn't around for a long stretch, they keep you engaged (I actually heard someone in the audience crying from such scenes!). All this serves to emphasize the theme of living and rebuilding after such harrowing times.As for Godzilla, he's presented as an aggressive territorial animal. He feels huge yet personal, his mere presence spine-chilling and power very impactful. This is helped by haunting music (though you still get the classic theme) and equally scary imagery and hard-hitting violence (not overtly bloody, mind you, but enough to leave an impression). There were even moments where it felt like ""Jaws"" in a good way. The times when he uses his atomic breath alone are straight up jaw-dropping. The army's battles with the kaiju are also done well, a good amount of destruction and utter fear, with a climax that's creative in its concept and execution. All this spectacle is done with excellent special effects despite being a fraction of the usual American budget these days; I could practically count every scale on Big G.All in all, ""Godzilla Minus One"" is a must-see that is well-deserved of the large amount of praise it's getting. Not only does it present the monster in a scary light that borders on horror, but it also has human characters that keep your attention, not to mention great music, effects, action, and story. My only slight critique is that the second half does drag a little. I should note that, as of the timing of this review, it's in Japanese with English subtitles, though the actors use a lot of facial expressions to convey the right emotions even when not talking. It gets my recommendation to those who haven't seen it.

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Godzilla Minus One doesn't even need Godzilla to succeed. Takashi Yamazaki's film is set in post World War II Japan, following a failed kamikaze pilot haunted by trauma and guilt, which manifests in the form of a destructive behemoth from the sea. The film stars Minami Hamabe and Kamiki Ryunosuke.The film is at its peak when it's a character study of a devastated Japan. Outside of the action scenes with Godzilla, the other half of the film is balanced well with compelling characters. Even with English subtitles, American audiences feel the emotional weight and turmoil of the actors' performances as their characters navigate the reconstruction of their lives. While I expected an epic action film, I was completely surprised by a poignant character-driven story. Showing the many conflicting viewpoints of the Japanese people through its characters, the film ultimately argues against the senseless loss of human life that was seen during WWII.Godzilla can be perceived as a symbol of death and destruction as the film brings the iconic reptilian monster back to its roots, unlike many of the recent American Godzilla films. Presented as a force of nature, Godzilla shows no remorse as it crushes people and buildings. Right as the struggles that the characters face seem to be coming to a resolution, Godzilla steps in with its atomic breath, a clear allegory for the atomic bomb and its destructive power. Since strong characters are established, the audience actually feels sadness when Godzilla mows through civilization.While the film had a tiny budget of 15 million dollars (compare that to Godzilla vs. Kong's nearly 200 million dollar budget), the visual effects were still effective. Though there were a few shaky shots, Godzilla's monstrous size came across nicely, creating thrilling action scenes. These action scenes were elevated further by the sturdy emotional core of the film.It should be noted that the film's back half wasn't nearly as compelling as its first half. The first hour of the film had a well balanced mix of action and drama. Unfortunately, the action takes a backseat during the last hour and the drama doesn't pack as much of a punch. The film also doesn't fully commit to some of its plot points, lessening the impact of some heartbreaking character moments. But, the film does eventually reach an explosively satisfying conclusion.Oddly, some may take issue with the film's inclusion of Godzilla. The character study aspect does stand on its own two feet and could've been made even better if it were solely focused on. Then again, a story about a pilot overcoming his guilt and creating a family wouldn't bring as big of an audience to theaters. In my opinion, Godzilla isn't totally unnecessary as its presence reinforces the film's messaging and metaphors.Godzilla Minus One not only succeeds at reinvigorating the terror in Godzilla but it also serves as a gripping presentation of a country pulling together to rebuild a past life. The synthesis of heart and action creates one of, if not the best, monster-centered action films.","Godzilla Minus One n't even need Godzilla succeed .

Godzilla_Minus_One,"The BankofMarquis just viewed one of the most entertaining films of 2023 - and it's a GODZILLA film.Yes, a GODZILLA film.From famed Japanese Studio Toho, makers of the original Godzilla film from the 1950's plus other ""man in a rubber suit"" monster movies like MOTHRA and WAR OF THE GARGANTUANS, Godzilla Minus One subverts the genre for a moment for instead of presenting a ""Monster stomping on buildings"" movie with some people in the background, this film is about the Japanese people and how they deal with the aftermath of World War II while (also) running from a giant monster stomping on buildings - but the monster story is the ""B"" story and the people story is the ""A"" story...and this subversion of the genre works very very well.The title of the film, Godzilla Minus One, refers to the fact that...after World War II.... Japan was ""starting from zero"". When Godzilla starts attacking, it knocks Japan back another peg, hence...Godzilla Minus One.Director and Screenwriter Takashi Yamazaki tells the tale of Koichi (Ryunosuke Kamiki) who encounters Godzilla towards the end of WWII and freezes, causing the death of his fellow soldiers (so his PTSD continues to tell him throughout the film). Once back in Japan, he encounters a young woman, Noriko (Minami Hamabe) who has been left orphaned, homeless and alone and is sheparding an abandoned baby. This unlikely trio form a bond...and a home...while trying to rebuild their lives and (in Koichi's case) tries to make sense of the devastation he encountered in the war.Into to this rebuilding stomps Godzilla.This story is effectively told by Yamazaki, who knows when to focus on the people aspect of the film and when to focus on the building stomping of Godzilla. It's a delicate balance that is helped by the performances of Kamiki and Hamabe...and the special effects that brings the spirit of the 1950's and 1960's Toho monster films to light.A surpwisingly rich entertainment, Godzilla Minus One will entertain you with monster stomping...and deep human emotion.Letter Grade: A- (I'm as surprised as you are)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","BankofMarquis viewed one entertaining films 2023 - 's GODZILLA film.Yes , GODZILLA film.From famed Japanese Studio Toho , makers original Godzilla film 1950 's plus `` man rubber suit '' monster movies like MOTHRA WAR GARGANTUANS , Godzilla Minus One subverts genre moment instead presenting `` Monster stomping buildings '' movie people background , film Japanese people deal aftermath World War II ( also ) running giant monster stomping buildings - monster story `` B '' story people story `` '' story ... subversion genre works well.The title film , Godzilla Minus One , refers fact ...

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Godzilla Minus One is virtually perfect, just as good as everyone is saying it is.Minus One is essentially a remake of the original Godzilla. Even the science fantasy plan to destroy the monster is a variation on the plan from the original, albeit somewhat less silly. Also like the original, a thematic focus of Minus One is the collective trauma which immediately follows a catastrophe. Interestingly, rather than staging the atomic bombs as the backdrop of that trauma, as in the original Godzilla, the trauma here, and in fact the physical setting in the first part of the movie, is Tokyo after the notorious fire bombing by the United States.Into the collective and immediate trauma, Minus One folds the post-traumatic trauma of its main protagonist, while also playing on the theme of redemption. The motivation behind this character's trauma is the conflict between that expectation of fulfilling one's duty that is so particular to Japanese culture, particularly WWII military culture, and specifically the duty to die expected of kamikaze pilots.If all of that seems rather intense for a ""mere"" monster movie, well, there is nothing ""mere"" about this flick. All of that depth is perfectly delivered through excellent acting from top to bottom (I teared up twice during this movie, something I have never done watching a kaiju), genuine character development, even among secondary characters, and impeccable direction. The choice of camera distance from characters, camera placement and angles, and the judicious use of slow motion, all contribute to that depth, too. Regarding slow motion: I generally hate it because it is so rarely used effectively and so often used in a cheesy, eye rolling way. As much as I love the Lord of the Rings trilogy, there are only one or two moments across all 11 and 1/2 hours that were made more effective through slow motion. The rest of those slow mo moments are the weakest shots in the entire trilogy. The exact opposite is the case here. Somehow, director Takashi Yamazaki uses slow motion several times with each moment being effective and affecting. One particularly brilliant use of slow motion combines it with screen silence. Yamazaki pulls out all the stops.The score is equally compelling. During some sequences, it's almost creepy, certainly atmospheric in a very non-action movie kind of way. It lends those moments a gravitas completely lacking in the blaring, heavy-handed scores of every American Godzilla movie. Composer Naoki Sato even works in Akira Ifukube's famous, doomy leitmotif, but does so sparingly. His score is as impeccable as Yamazaki's directing.Finally, the special effects. Unlike the cartoonish, glowy, neon CG of the American Godzilla movies of the last 10 years or so, Minus One's monster is naturalistic. It looks like an animal be it a horrifying, almost supernatural one. Similarly, the buildings and their destruction is less spectacle and more catastrophic devastation, more appropriately reflecting the damage done by the fire bombing and the atomic bombs.I don't often write such long reviews, but this movie knocked my socks off. I will buy it when it's available on disc, also not something I often do with newer movies.","Godzilla Minus One virtually perfect , good everyone saying is.Minus One essentially remake original Godzilla .

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Nothing will prepare you for how spectacularly awesome this version of Godzilla is. Dare I say it even bests the original 1954 version, which I thought could never be done. Forget all those regrettable storylines of hollow earth or Godzilla as the great protector of Mother Earth. Godzilla Minus One is less a movie about giant Kaiju wreaking havoc on civilization- although we do get that, too- and more a serious (deadly serious) tale of the human toll of war. Unlike previous Godzilla films, there isn't the direct link between the birth of the atomic age and the birth of Godzilla. Instead, Minus One very effectively takes a more human approach.Ryunosuke Kamiki' Koichi is the lens we are forced to see the horrors of the aftermath of the war. Returning to his village to far less than a hero's welcome, Koichi is faced with trying to rebuild his life after loss of his parents. Soon, his burden is set upon by the arrival of Hamabe Minami' Noriko and the baby she has been left to care for. This is a bleak film. And, Koichi and Noriko painstakingly try to eke out an existence among the rubble. The performances of Kamiki and Minami are near Oscar worthy. But, in all honesty, there isn't a single bad performance in this film.There is not a lot of Godzilla in this film. American audiences will probably expect more giant lizard for their ticket price, but in this case the film is better for it. When we do see Godzilla, he is all menace. He is hell bent on destruction, and ravages the city reminiscent of the first film. However, because this takes place in a post war landscape, the devastation carries more weight. The emotional tug is something unlike any previous Godzilla movie.There really isn't much not to love about this movie. The cinematography is excellent. The performances are exceptional. The effects make most Hollywood big-budget films of recent memory seem laughable. And, there is enough classic Godzilla moments to remind you why you bought a ticket in the first place.Bravo Toho Studios and Takashi Yamazaki!

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Highly recommended for anyone jaded with over use of CG effects, or tired of catching up on hours of TV / movie series in order to fully enjoy a fully paid yet incomplete film.The film smartly introduces characters and plots with minimalist dialogues so non-Japanese speaking audiences can focus on the story instead of busy reading subtitles. The cast of familiar seasoned actors expressed themselves with universal body language such as embraces and tears so the language barrier is not a concern at all.This movie serves up a touching story of personal tragedy, post-war grief, and the strength of friendship, familial bond, and courage in face of rising cold war tensions and unprecedented crisis from a terrifying creature.Obviously one can read into the heatwave blast from Godzilla and its territorial attacks (it tries to move into Tokyo Bay and shop in Ginza district, fancy!) as a symbolic cautionary tale of weapons of mass destruction, wrath of nature, etc. Thankfully the action scenes delivered tension without overstaying its welcome nor being preachy. 2 hours is just right amount of time to build characters, relationships, suspense and tension.One critical message in the story was the redemptive power of forgiveness, hope and communal solidarity to protect the future. A few remarks were made about how the government treated its soldiers' lives too cheaply, with poor equipment and supplies; and how information about Godzilla's imminent attack on Tokyo was suppressed to avoid chaos (uh, that reminds me of the mayor unwilling to warn the beach goers about the great white). The writers try to acknowledge the dire poverty and a sense of abandonment in postwar Japan without being cynical. The story is made to be uplifting and hopeful. The success of this movie is telling studio executives that audiences want movies with a heart. If the film happens to be in a theatre near you, enjoy!","Highly recommended anyone jaded use CG effects , tired catching hours TV / movie series order fully enjoy fully paid yet incomplete film.The film smartly introduces characters plots minimalist dialogues non-Japanese speaking audiences focus story instead busy reading subtitles . cast familiar seasoned actors expressed universal body language embraces tears language barrier concern all.This movie serves touching story personal tragedy , post-war grief , strength friendship , familial bond , courage face rising cold war tensions unprecedented crisis terrifying creature.Obviously one read heatwave blast Godzilla territorial attacks ( tries move Tokyo Bay shop Ginza district , fancy ! ) symbolic cautionary tale weapons mass destruction , wrath nature , etc .

Godzilla_Minus_One,"For perhaps the first time in his 70 year career, Godzilla is terrifying. Not only is this the best of the Godzilla series, nothing in the Jurassic films comes close to the terror, suspense, intelligence, and drama of GODZILLA MINUS ONE. The performance of Ryunoskuke Kamiki anchors the film and carries the audience on a rewarding emotional journey. Naoki Sato's score is particularly effective. Rarely does cinema get better than this.Feeling as if he unfairly cheated death too many times, Shikishima, a surviving Kamikaze pilot is attacked on Odo Island along with many war plane engineers by a gargantuan monster. After the engineers die due to Shikishima failing to distract the monster, an overwhelming amount of guilt weighs on him, especially after a homeless woman and a baby move into his home when he returns. Shikishima, now on a personal mission, teams up with a large group of veterans to finally take down the monster known as Godzilla.","perhaps first time 70 year career , Godzilla terrifying . best Godzilla series , nothing Jurassic films comes close terror , suspense , intelligence , drama GODZILLA MINUS ONE . performance Ryunoskuke Kamiki anchors film carries audience rewarding emotional journey .

Japan was the only country to experience the atomic bombs and made Godzilla as a way to show this experience in a form people could connect with.All I could think of when we saw what Godzilla was capable of is ""wow this must be what an atomic bomb must be like.""

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Set at the end of World War 2 and Japan is defeated and in ruins. Our protagonist is Koichi, a pilot who returns to his devastated hometown in Tokyo. He is unwelcome and guilt ridden for sneaking out of a kamikaze raid in the pacific. Japan is at its lowest point and then Godzilla arrives.This is a brilliant setup for this period story that sees a country without the military might, technology and morale to face this new enemy. The film also leans into the drama and emotion that made the first film so iconic and sets it apart from the family fun films of the 70s and 80s as well as the recent American blockbuster treatments. My Japanese is not good enough to understand all of the film so there will be lots that I didn't get. However it manages to be a strong, emotional story with a scary and ferocious Godzilla. In my mind it is far superior to Shin Godzilla which I found dull and goofy. This is the best Godzilla film in many years and perhaps the best since the 1954 original.","Set end World War 2 Japan defeated ruins . protagonist Koichi , pilot returns devastated hometown Tokyo . unwelcome guilt ridden sneaking kamikaze raid pacific .

Godzilla_Minus_One,"2014's Godzilla looked very impressive, with great sound and impressive visuals, etc., but it was missing a crucial element: interesting HUMAN characters. I found myself not caring anything about the people in it. This movie rectifies that. Sure, it has plenty of Godzilla monster action, showing him stomping on Tokyo, chomping on people, destroying ships, and using his atomic breath, but this time, it's not just empty spectacle. He's threatening and interacting with people we care about. It's a very personal story. The original was a powerful anti war film, portraying Godzilla as a metaphor for atomic weapons. I see this movie more as a metaphor for Japan coming to terms with WWII. The final line of dialogue emphasizes this.","2014 's Godzilla looked impressive , great sound impressive visuals , etc. , missing crucial element : interesting HUMAN characters . found caring anything people . movie rectifies .

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Godzilla: Minus One (2023)(10/10): I managed to get myself to the theatre this weekend to see the newest entry in the Godzilla Canon that is celebrating Godzilla's 70th anniversary, and happy birthday Godzilla, you sure know how to celebrate.Made by Toho the company that created Godzilla, the film is more true to the monsters roots than any of the American films but it marks a major shift for Godzilla as it is the first period piece Godzilla film and not only that but the film is a huge leap in terms of its storytelling as they were more giant monster mashes that had a story but it wasn't why one would be watching.FROM HERE ON I'M DIVING INTO SPOILER TERRITORY SO YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.Godzilla: Minus One takes place back in the World War Two era where we find our main character, Koichi, who is a Kamikaze fighter pilot that went rogue and landed on an island in hopes of surviving the upcoming battle that night Koichi notices fish that have died and rose to the surface and floated ashore and then the small base begins to feel a large quake and then when the spotlight turns on a large dinosaur like creature is revealed.They believe it to be the long rumoured beast Godzilla, a monster who comes from the sea that causes fish to die and rise to the surface and then leaves nothing but destruction in its wake.Being as the base is only small and not meant for battle, Koichi is ordered to sneak over to his place and fire his guns, but he freezes and eventually the monster is angered and kills everyone at the base, with the only two living being Koichi and the man who had ordered him to shoot.Eventually Koichi returns home now stricken with the guilt of many deaths he could've possibly prevented, but he then finds himself then suffering from more guilt as the city is destroyed by the war with thousands of lives lost, even his parents.He is one day at the market built from the rubble of the city when a mysterious woman being pursued by authorities gives him a baby, he decides to take it home as he couldn't just leave her alone and then is greeted by the woman who handed him the baby as she explains that she was orphaned and her parents told her to watch over her.Koichi decides to let them stay with him and then they raise the child themselves, however Koichi is still not able to accept that he is now the child's father with the memories that haunt him and make him refuse to let anyone in.He gets a job on a small ship that is designed for the destruction of mines and is eventually forced into the battle against his inner demon when he is confronted with the reality that Godzilla is far from gone and both US and Soviet forces have already decided that they are not aiding in this fight.His crew are sent out into the waters where they soon realize that they are acting as a diversion to distract Godzilla while larger ships are on their way as Godzilla is heading towards Tokyo when they see a huge naval ship that had been destroyed something that no weapon or large sea animal could do.They also realize that the enemy has most likely gotten much larger since the attack on the island two years ago when a much larger amount of fish rise to the surface.They are then confronted by a massive behemoth of a monster and they're only armed with a mounted machine gun and two mines, they manage to detonate the first one to no avail and as they detonate the second in Godzilla's mouth they are then faced with the threat that he has the ability to regenerate from wounds.Luckily they are saved by the arrival of the naval forces, or so they think as Godzilla quickly makes mincemeat of the heavy artillery and blows them off the face of the earth with his newly acquired atomic breath.Waking in a hospital Koichi is then immediately determined to have the government inform the public of the oncoming threat yet they refuse and he heads home and is eventually put in the position where he has to tell his companion of all the things that torment him and he is even restored of his hope for a normal life again.A couple days later the city is thrown into chaos as Godzilla ensues destruction upon the city and Koichi is then forced to run into the fray to save his companion yet once Godzilla annihilates the entire city with his atomic breath she sacrifices herself for Koichi and pushes him out of the way of all the shrapnel.Koichi now devastated is furious and fueled by vengeance, his colleagues come to him with a plan for killing Godzilla once and for all, and they are wondering if he was interested in attending the meeting to pitch the idea to the remaining civilians as the armed forces have since stated they are no longer planning to retaliate against the beast.They are now aware that Godzilla cannot be killed by conventional means so they will instead be using the remaining naval ships to deploy canisters that will cause the water to bubble and then make Godzilla sink, they intend to execute it in the deepest part of the ocean in their territory and distract Godzilla long enough to loop the canister around him and then once tied up activate the canisters and force Godzilla down as far as possible as fast as possible so that he suffers from the effects of intense pressure and as a backup have floatation devices attached to then make him rise fast enough to succumb to more pressure, but Koichi has something he feels is necessary, he needs a plane so he can serve as bait just in case Godzilla doesn't pass through those waters.He contacts the man from the island and manages to convince him to get an old fighter plane up and running, and even equipping it with a bomb on the inside as a last resort for him to kamikaze into Godzilla's mouth with an active bomb.Koichi leaves his daughter behind in the care of a trusted friend and is ready to make his sacrifice and be able to put his demons to rest, but will they succeed? What will happen to Koichi?Well that was a mouthful, but it is something that a Godzilla has been lacking up until now, a full character arc and an engaging human story.First off I must say that Godzilla looks phenomenal, I love everything about his new design and biology as well as the effects which were fantastic, hands down best digital effects and CGI I have seen in the longest time, and it was all in the approach to it.Godzilla looks more like his original design where it was a man in a suit, but they took that look and touched it up with modern technology that then made him have more fluid movement.Also Godzilla looks so good that he puts CGI in modern Hollywood to shame as he actually looks real, like legitimately terrifying at some points, I especially found the scenes in the water where Godzilla was chasing the small boat and we get a good look at his face for the first time, but all scenes were pulled off very well and made Godzilla frightening as well as awesome.I did find myself conflicted with rooting for Godzilla or the people, because it feels so satisfying to see the destruction unfold yet the characters are incredibly strong and compelling that you feel their pain, especially Koichi, who made me cry more than once.The new Godzilla design, I forgot that, so like I said it was primarily if not all CGI and it looks phenomenal, and the look of Godzilla is reminiscent of the original design but with more detail and some added biological elements that make Godzilla feel even more powerful than before.First is the regeneration which I had mentioned before but there's more to it than just regeneration, he is more susceptible to damage from the inside than the outside as much of the damage sustained from the outside is brushed off quickly. The Atomic Breath also gets a bit of an upgrade as Godzilla begins to glow blue starting from the end of his tail making it's way up to the back of his neck as each of his plates protrude a bit more as they glow as well but what really is the newest aspect is that the beam is thin and is almost like firing a sniper rifle except for the fact that the damage is the literal equivalent of an atomic bomb, Mushroom Cloud, fallout and completely irradiating the ground zero for the target, however his regeneration plays into his Atomic Breath as it's so powerful Godzilla even suffers damage from it and has to rest and regenerate.I also like the approach of going back to where it all started, as an allegory for the Atomic Bomb dropped during World War Two, even making it set in the forties makes the threat that much stronger, especially with the newly added abilities.I would say that it could use more Godzilla but that would only be true if the human story was not engaging, so I am actually satisfied with the amount of screen time that Godzilla has.Now I hope you're watching Hollywood, and you best take notes as Japan knows how to make a monster movie, because they have been doing it for seventy years.Godzilla: Minus One is a contender for not only best Godzilla film, but could very well be a contender for best monster movie.Seventy Years Later and you still haven't lost your touch,

Godzilla_Minus_One,"My family left the theater in awe. And I think Godzilla's atomic bomb breath blew all the speakers out of the theater. What an amazing achievement this director and the actors have done by creating this Post world war II movie. We were awe struck by the set pieces in this film.

Godzilla_Minus_One,"""Godzilla is the son of the atomic bomb... ...He is a nightmare created out of the darkness of the human soul. He is the sacred beast of the apocalypse. As long as the arrogance of Man exists, Godzilla will survive..."" - David Kalat, author, ""A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series""""Godzilla Minus One"" is living proof that in the words of one viewer over on YouTube, you can re-tell the exact same story a dozen different ways and you can still produce an excellent end-product. Japan saw fit to reboot its long-running ""Godzilla"" series with ""Shin Gojira"" back in 2016, and has re-booted the franchise, yet again, with ""Godzilla Minus One,"" which was released in Japanese theaters on November 3rd, 2023, to mark the 69th anniversary of the film that started it all, Ishiro Honda's grim black & white ""Gojira"" (1954); ""Godzilla Minus One"" saw an American theatrical release today on December 1st, 2023, making it the first Japanese-produced ""Godzilla"" film to be released theatrically in the United States since ""Shin Gojira,"" which itself was the first Japanese-produced ""Godzilla"" film to be released domestically since ""Godzilla 2000"" (1999) (which as a tearful aside, was the last film I ever saw at the Cineplex Odeon at my local shopping mall before it closed down later that summer in 2000).As most readers here know, I am a life-long Godzilla fan; ""Gojira"" is my all-time favorite giant monster movie (and 1989's ""Godzilla vs. Biollante"" is my favorite giant monster ""versus"" movie and is a unique gem amongst giant monster movies and ""Godzilla"" movies, more specifically - I love it). When I had first heard that Toho was planning on releasing yet another kaiju-eiga (""Japanese monster movie"") featuring the mighty ""King of the Monsters,"" I began to get really excited. (It's really hard for me to get excited about most new movies these days for a litany of reasons. More on this in a bit.) Of course, Toho was keen to keep the very specific details of the movie under wraps, which only made the anticipation greater. (I had experienced that same sensation of immense excitement when ""Shin Gojira"" received a one-week distribution stateside back in 2016, and I had to drive all the way to Washington, D. C., from my home in Northern Virginia, which is where the nearest theater playing the film was located.)As written and directed by visual effects specialist Takashi Yamazaki, ""Godzilla Minus One"" takes a huge creative leap with firmly established Godzilla lore by going back to the beginning. Well, not just going back to the beginning, but going back even FURTHER than when things first began with ""Gojira"" in 1954. Yamazaki's film opens during the closing days of World War II in Japan, and ends two years later in 1947 - seven years before Honda's original. We all know the story of how a fictional dinosaur species called a ""Godzillasaurus,"" which was living on a deserted island in the South Pacific Ocean after the Second World War, was then exposed to radioactive fallout from American nuclear weapons testing in the region, and how it later mutated into a gargantuan, seemingly indestructible fire-breathing beast that later attacked Japan - Gojira (""Godzilla,"" in English).But right there, by setting ""Godzilla Minus One"" immediately after Japan's defeat in World War II and having Godzilla appear much sooner than he did in Ishiro Honda's original, Yamazaki's film stands apart from ""Gojira"" and it gives Yamazaki some new creative and dramatic territory to explore - in this case, how Japan, already at its lowest point after having surrendered to the Allies following the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945, must now contend with another looming disaster of unprecedented scale: an attack by a gigantic, radioactive, fire-breathing monster (or daikaiju, ""giant strange beast"").The story here focuses on Imperial Japanese Navy kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki), who in the final days of WWII in 1945, lands on Odo Island after feigning that his plane is experiencing technical issues. He meets with the lead mechanic there, Sokaku Tachibana (Munetaka Aoki), and during the night their camp is attacked by a giant dinosaur that comes ashore from the ocean and slaughters everyone except Shikishima and Tachibana, who comes to blame Shikishima for his hesitation at a critical moment which resulted in the deaths of all their comrades.Later that year after Japan's surrender, Shikishima, wracked with survivor's guilt, returns to Tokyo, which has been ravaged by Allied fire-bombing raids - raids that claimed the lives of both his parents. (As an aside, these scenes of a devastated post-war Tokyo have to be a visual reference to the eye-witness accounts given by Ishiro Honda himself after he'd been discharged from service overseas in the Imperial Japanese Army, and then toured Hiroshima on his way home following the city's atomic bombing, and he later used these experiences to form his vision of the character of Godzilla. And as a matter of fact, Yamazaki, as a visual effects artist, has a nice taste for shocking and unsettling imagery - the first sighting of the un-mutated Godzillasaurus, the actual first appearance of Godzilla at sea or the so-called ""black rain"" following the giant monster's later rampage on Tokyo, are some prime examples - which makes his film one of the more visually interesting ""Godzilla"" features ever produced.) While salvaging what little he has left, he meets Noriko (Minami Hamabe), another war orphan who carries in her tow, an infant girl named Akiko (Sae Nagatani), whose mother perished in the fire-bombing raids and had charged Noriko with the child's care. He allows the two of them to move in with him and a loose family of sorts is born.Pretty soon, however, Japan, which is only in the early stages of reconstruction (just at it was in ""Gojira""), is threatened by the terror of Godzilla, who rises from the Pacific Ocean to unleash his wrath on a country that has already suffered heavy devastation brought on by nuclear bombers, and must now face a threat that could destroy the country completely. Since Japan cannot rely on its military (the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces were disbanded in 1945 following the surrender, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces - JSDF - weren't founded until July of 1954) or the United States (Japan would not begin to enter into a series of mutual security and cooperation legislative agreements with the U. S., and thus become our closest Asian ally, until the early 1950s) for aid - due to rising tensions with the Soviet Union - it is up to Shikishima and a few other dedicated private citizens to defeat Godzilla and protect what little country of theirs that is left to protect.""Godzilla Minus One"" is a thrilling cinematic event the likes of which I have not experienced since, well, ""Shin Gojira."" I should now state here that I rarely go to the movies anymore, as there just isn't much out there these days that truly interests me. Since superhero movies no longer carry the geeky thrill that they once did for this viewer, I found ""Godzilla Minus One"" to be a much-welcomed shot in the arm, and something very, very different from much of what I've seen lately. That it was a subtitled foreign-language feature that had received a wide distribution stateside (""Godzilla 2000"" had a wide theatrical release back in 2000, while, as stated earlier, ""Shin Gojira"" only had a one-week engagement back in 2016), ""Godzilla Minus One"" lives up to its high expectations and by going in a different direction from the anti-bureaucratic satire of ""Shin Gojira"" and by extension the dark apocalyptic tone of ""Gojira,"" this makes it stand out from much of the fare that I've seen in recent years, and even other ""Godzilla"" films.What also makes ""Godzilla Minus One"" stand out is that it's a feature that is not steeped in nostalgia or purposeful throwbacks to the ""Godzilla"" films of yesteryear (most domestic so-called ""legacy"" features love doing that for eagle-eyed, dog-eared fans of the originals to compensate for a lack of originality). Yes, ""Godzilla Minus One"" does include some obligatory references to films past, including some familiar musical themes by the late Akira Ifukube, who also created Godzilla's signature roar in the original 1954 ""Gojira"" and who remained Japan's most esteemed composer until his death in 2006. But this film is not about an avid fan-boy geeking out and showing off his hero-worship of the material. No, ""Godzilla Minus One"" is simply a tale of a country trying to pick itself up again following the end of a devastating conflict - a conflict that nearly destroyed the nation - and having to face a force of nature more dangerous and destructive than any war. That is perhaps where Takashi Yamazaki succeeds the most, and his film is also not steeped in the usual anti-American resentment and finger-pointing and anti-nuclear allegory, and - and! - the assertive pro-Japanese nationalist sentiment of most recent ""Godzilla"" movies (a more recent phenomenon that has been pervasive in many ""Godzilla"" features since the early 1990s, after Japan had fully rebuilt its economy and was looking to re-assert itself on the global market).""Godzilla Minus One"" is a ""Godzilla"" film that was well worth the seven-year wait.""Godzilla Minus One"" rates a solid ""10.""10/10.","`` Godzilla son atomic bomb ... ... nightmare created darkness human soul . sacred beast apocalypse . long arrogance Man exists , Godzilla survive ...

Godzilla_Minus_One,"The story is set amidst the physical and emotional wreckage of Japan at the end of WW2 and just after. This realism is blended very well with a fictitious monster. For Japan, the war was not over.The unforgettable production utilizes some of the original Godzilla music. It is in Japanese with English subtitles.The story is pro-human. Seeing how people cared for each other in the midst of disaster is what moved me to tears. No snarky or edgy dialog or lame jokes that ruin so many Hollywood scripts in my opinion. Come to think of it, I can't remember a single humorous moment in the movie, though there were moments of joy and comraderie.It is a story about grass roots self-reliance and cooperation. Although some military men assist them, the Japanese realize that their government won't save them. Scientists and former military men come together, borrow some military equipment form a plan to defeat Godzilla.It is also a story about cowardice, the crippling shame that comes with it, and how cowardice can actually buy time for one to build one's courage. Remember what they say about backing away from a fight and staying alive so you can live to fight another day.I am not going to spoil it for you.

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Watched for the first time on December 2nd 2023
Format: IMAX
My rating is 8.5/10Synopsis: Post war Japan is at its lowest point when a new crisis emerges in the form of a giant monster, baptized in the horrific power of the atomic bomb. (Source: IMDb)When was the last time that we witnessed a 'monster film' that didn't have a cheap script with a target of just making lots of money?Minus one proves that it's not entirely a film about a monster, rather it's a film about humanity, Inner self, grief, and family. The film was able to create a story about Godzilla but from a different perspective by combining both drama and action together. Brining a character that struggles with himself, his past, his grief, and his PTSD. As well as adding side characters that will bring a more dramatic experience to his life and to audience members.Moreover, the film really surprised me by using Japan's tragedy after the WWII, and building the film's plot around it.

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Almost 70 years after the first GODZILLA film by Ishiro HONDA, the Japanese film studio TOHO has dared to reorient the globally successful Kaiju film franchise. And this venture has succeeded spectacularly. But one after anonther!On October 27, 1954, the very first GODZILLA film (the monster's actual name is Gojima in Japanese) premiered in Tokyo. One of the main actors was the actor Akira TAKARADA (1934-2022), who died just a year ago. The aftermath of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the devastating defeat in the Second World War and the psychological devastation of Japanese society were congenially woven into a monster story that could be understood worldwide and led to a long-lasting film success with countless follow-up films.GODZILLA MINUS ONE follows on from this, with director Takashi YAMAZAKI (born 1964) telling the history and origins of GOJIMA.The focus is on the deserting kamikaze pilot Koichi (Ryunosuke KAMIKI), who encounters the monster for the first time in the very last days of the war. Back in Tokyo, Koichi is confronted with the destruction of Japan and the distress of the survivors. He soon finds a companion (Minami HAMABE) and joins a ship that takes care of removing the explosive weapons. The still badly shaken Koichi and the ship's crew soon meet Gojima again. When the monster sets course for Tokyo, events come to a head...This film has become an outstanding monster film that impresses with spectacular scenes that you should definitely see on the big screen. At the same time, it is also an illuminating depiction of the disillusioned post-war society in Japan.The Japanese film studio TOHO has achieved a great success here, which will almost certainly be a worldwide success. A sequel is sure to follow, which is something to look forward to now!","Almost 70 years first GODZILLA film Ishiro HONDA , Japanese film studio TOHO dared reorient globally successful Kaiju film franchise . venture succeeded spectacularly . one anonther !

Godzilla_Minus_One,"'Godzilla Minus One' is a story about survival, struggle, relationships, trauma, PTSD, the effects of war, shame, guilt and redemption. Never have I seen a movie about Godzilla that was so much not about Godzilla.While the special effects were worthwhile with some frightening sequences from the monster himself, I left the theater in tears with so much on my mind about this story, the people, the monster that is war itself and the personal wars we still live through after the fight is over.The actors themselves give the type of performance I haven't seen in a long time in monster movies. Typically, this tends to be an issue with those types of movies where the human characters actually get in the way of the story developing either by regressing it or deviating from it.

Godzilla_Minus_One,"Godzilla Minus One was one of my most anticipated films of the year, and it mostly lived up to the hype for me. It's got an intriguing premise, taking place even earlier than the 1954 original film, with the events of the film playing out in the first couple of years after the end of World War II. The emergence of Godzilla at such a time makes him even more of a danger, given Japan is recovering from the war, and it gives a reason for the then-decimated Japanese military to not be around much to deal with the threat (US forces are also said to be too busy dealing with the new Cold War to help much, which feels about right).There is less action than one might expect from a Godzilla movie, but the big moments do deliver. I loved the opening (surprisingly reminiscent of the campy time-travel-themed Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah from 1991), and then the way each appearance of Godzilla felt bigger, more dramatic, and longer than the last. As for the human side of things, the side characters aren't too complicated, but they are interesting and endearing. The protagonist is given easily the most to reckon with, as he's haunted by guilt from his involvement in the war, and becomes something of a reluctant here with very personal reasons for wanting to take down Godzilla.The plan to deal with the monster is clever, and makes for a good climax. Godzilla himself is also pretty scary in this one - maybe not as visually horrifying as the monster in Shin Godzilla, but that Godzilla was more an oddly tragic and kind of mindless force of nature - more natural disaster than enemy. Minus One's Godzilla is mean, and it makes every appearance he has feel truly weighty.There are elements of the ending I didn't find particularly satisfying - not so much the third act climax, but certain things after that ensured Minus One ended on a tiny bit of a whimper for me. Some might not be crazy about the fact Godzilla disappears for large amounts of time, but the story and the characters involved within it were generally interesting to me; much more so than your average Godzilla movie.As far as Godzilla vs. Humanity movies go (I do have more of a soft spot for Godzilla vs. Other monster entries), Minus One is one of the better ones; up there with the 1954 original and 2016's Shin Godzilla.","Godzilla Minus One one anticipated films year , mostly lived hype .

Godzilla_Minus_One,"It's interesting how in the summer of 2023, people ironically watched ""Barbieheimer"". The pairing that actually makes the most sense for 2023 is a double feature of Oppenheimer followed by Godzilla Minus One. Both are epic stories about man versus nature, set on opposite sides of the atomic age, the second world war, and the line between history and historical fiction.This Godzilla has a unique style and tone. The movie's theme is about the horror and aftermath of war, comparing the conflict between US-Japan against the conflict between Japan-Godzilla.Most striking is the movie's understated style. As a Japanese film, the CGI is naturally more muted than what they produce in Hollywood. The movie is set in the late 1940s and they made the movie look like it was filmed in the 1950s. The score is riveting, combining the classic Godzilla themes with modern epic themes. The characters act like real people, not like caricatures typical of most superhero films.I'm very pleased to have watched the movie at a theater. I only wish I had seen it earlier when it was shown in the larger auditoriums.","'s interesting summer 2023 , people ironically watched `` Barbieheimer '' . pairing actually makes sense 2023 double feature Oppenheimer followed Godzilla Minus One . epic stories man versus nature , set opposite sides atomic age , second world war , line history historical fiction.This Godzilla unique style tone . movie 's theme horror aftermath war , comparing conflict US-Japan conflict Japan-Godzilla.Most striking movie 's understated style .

Barbie,"Firstly, let's start with what was good about Barbie and move forward from there. The colourful palette, the set designs and costumes were perfect to bring you into a world that doesn't take itself too seriously. Barbie wasn't meant to get all philosophical and it wasn't necessarily supposed to provide us with a point. What it gave little girls is happiness and entertainment value. In the early stages of the movie it undoubtedly had potential to be a lot of fun with a comedic effect.This silly satire soon finds itself covering too much ground about how the world of Barbie is female dominant, alongside how the real world is male dominant. It evolves into a feminist movement film that is a little dated, then slowly back peddles and suggests everyone should be who they want to be. That all you have to do is find out who you are and what your purpose is. It almost becomes lost within its own thought pattern without really conveying anything meaningful. It feels like a load of thoughts with no conclusion or that somebody has thrown a pad of post-it notes in the air. The musical tone and lighthearted comedy that seemed set to propel this movie into box office glory, felt neglected to some extent, when real world themes were contemplated. What was working at first will slowly devour with over dramatic speeches of everything that is wrong with a male dominated world. As well as other complaints about having so much on your plate and being too god damn tired.Barbie finds herself wanting to leave Barbieland to feel real emotions rather than go through day to day life like everything is perfect. The cross-over between worlds worked to some degree, to me it was showing the girl leaving behind her dolls and becoming a woman to join the sometimes scary, but real world. (Margot Robbie) portrays Barbie very simplistic, her approach works as that seems to be what Greta Gerwig aimed to show. Greta Gerwig differentiates the worlds developing both Barbie and Ken as they learn from their experience interacting with the real world. There appeared to be references to the Matrix to me as Barbie is given a choice between staying in Barbie world or going to the real world to discover what's causing her malfunctions. Also the owner Ruth Marianna Handler gives off an Oracle vibe in the scene where she offers Barbie tea. One little girl blames Barbie claiming she set women back decades making them stereotypical girly girls without a purpose except looking pretty putting clothes on and off and doing house chores.(Ryan Gosling) gives Ken a lot of charisma and is purposely obnoxious at times creating an antagonist for Barbie. The Ken's are portrayed as weak little love puppies in Barbie world without a purpose juxtaposed with how women are received in the real world. Gosling reminds me of a wrestling villain that the crowd are wanting to hate on, he is a little over the top as he is turned against his fellow Ken's by Barbie manipulation. The poor performance of Gosling attempting to cry towards the climax added to the later half of the movie losing it way. It all becomes a little too silly leaving the audience flabbergasted at what absurdity they just witnessed.","Firstly , let 's start good Barbie move forward . colourful palette , set designs costumes perfect bring world n't take seriously .

The subjects touched on are explicitly verbalized in the film, it doesn't allow for such a deep analysis without being redundant with the message delivered.If we get into the technical fibers of the film, the script and the performance of Ryan Gosling is the highlight of the film.

Barbie,"BARBIE is a film I find incredibly difficult to both review and rate. On the face of it, the trappings are pitiful and the tone is all over the place. The audience I saw it with were laughing at the dumbest jokes imaginable (like Gosling bouncing off the plastic wave) and missing all of the depth, which is what I personally found appealing. It's very hard to take such a tongue-in-cheek approach seriously, but then you could argue that it's deliberately bad, deliberately plasticky. Not that that excuses the bad acting from the likes of Ferrera et al. Despite this, the film's skewering of the patriarchy is spot-on, and Gosling turns out to be very good, stealing the film from the others. So it's a film I appreciate some parts of, and not others.","BARBIE film find incredibly difficult review rate . face , trappings pitiful tone place . audience saw laughing dumbest jokes imaginable ( like Gosling bouncing plastic wave ) missing depth , personally found appealing .

Barbie,"The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.","movie funny really enjoyable laugh full theatre .

Napoleon,"I feel unsatisfied walking out of that theater after three hours of melancholy and confusion. I understand every single word and every single scene, but when they connect into a whole film I don't understand anything. To start off, the costume/production design, naturalistic sceneries, the two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares --- one amid the doleful squall of Austerlitz and another atop the dampened prairie of Waterloo --- and all other technical stuff are spotless. However, there's an anxiety-inducing problem with the narrative --- the movie has no focus. No climax, no resonating themes like Oppenheimer, just one plain, linear, chronological plot; and even that we get multiple baffling time jumps throughout. The plot is so simple that everything in the film was taught in my AP World History class last year in one day, except it nibbles on some superficial details. Highlighting the relationship between Napolean and Josephine is a unique take, and I do see efforts from the two esteemed performers to capture their mutual toxicity and intricacy, but this love story has barely anything to do with the movie's main arc, Napolean's personal rise and fall. Nothing! Two basically unrelated storylines unfolding in the most bland way possible. Also adding to this insipid mess is the score, which is composed primarily of classical or really old-sounding French folk --- what happened to Radiohead from the trailer? God Ridley I don't wanna say three hours of my life is wasted but it kinda is!I didn't think it was possible but, I think Oppenheimer's winning the Oscar.","feel unsatisfied walking theater three hours melancholy confusion . understand every single word every single scene , connect whole film n't understand anything . start , costume/production design , naturalistic sceneries , two meticulously-depicted ancient warfares -- - one amid doleful squall Austerlitz another atop dampened prairie Waterloo -- - technical stuff spotless .

Napoleon,"I ""wanted"" to like this movie.I really did.I've been warned about the pacing issues tho.And well, they didn't lie.It doesn't matter if Scott wants to release a 4 hour version.You do not spend 200 MILLION on movie, working on it for years to then put in a wide-release in cinemas and not be content with your own product.He had no studio interference, no budget cuts, no last-minute rewrites, edits or recasts.Everything went exactly the way he wanted to do it.So why is this the final result?Hundreds of historical inaccuracies.He doesn't care for accuracy?That's ok, it's a movie, not a documentary.But what does he do with this ""creative freedom""?Next to nothing.Hardly perceivable character arcs, atrocious pacing (seriously, it's absolutely all over the place) and lack of depth.What ""saves"" this movie to a 5/10 are Phoenix and especially Kirby, top notch technical filmmaking (not Scott's work tho but oh well) and interesting story adapted to begin with.But this could have been so much more.2023 really seems to be the year of the exciting, fresh, original and risk taking blockbusters, which all, ultimately, disappoint one way or the other.It's just sad, honestly.Even against the horrendous ""competition"" in the big budget market, all the Finchers, Scorceses and Scott's STILL, inexplicably, manage to underperform.We need new directors, new stories, new approaches, and new chances.They have run their luck.PS:

Napoleon,"This film is simply made to try to destroy a historical, complex character, putting only the bad and accentuating it but forgetting everything that led him to be great.It lacks a script or a common thread, the trailer comes closer than the time wasted on a film without the slightest trace of history, only the lucubrations of its director (who could have dedicated the money of this film to do something with more quality).It is for the young audience with no knowledge of history who know nothing about Napoleon, to try to destroy the historical figure, in the same way that current movements judge without having the slightest idea of how the era worked, in which the characters are framed. And for that audience, the movie will become terribly boring. And for those who know history, the film will seem like a disgrace.A budget splurge one might expect from Jar Jar Abrams. It sounds sad, but Ridley Scott after this movie should think about retiring.The best are the battle scenes, of course, discounting the effect that the artillery in its effects seems more like something out of the artillery of the First World War than of the artillery of that time.But the battle scenes don't balance a lack of script and a negative respect for the character and historical fidelity. And Josephine, it's better not to talk about it, her function in the film is to remind us that we are seeing a yellow rubbish of zero historical value.","film simply made try destroy historical , complex character , putting bad accentuating forgetting everything led great.It lacks script common thread , trailer comes closer time wasted film without slightest trace history , lucubrations director ( could dedicated money film something quality ) .It young audience knowledge history know nothing Napoleon , try destroy historical figure , way current movements judge without slightest idea era worked , characters framed . audience , movie become terribly boring . know history , film seem like disgrace.A budget splurge one might expect Jar Jar Abrams . sounds sad , Ridley Scott movie think retiring.The best battle scenes , course , discounting effect artillery effects seems like something artillery First World War artillery time.But battle scenes n't balance lack script negative respect character historical fidelity .

Napoleon,"It's got the budget, the cast, the set... And then it falls flat on its face. What a waste!The script and Ridley Scott as director are probably the first to blame. The script is neither here or there. With a 2.5 hour run time, the script tries to be a bit of everything and it delivers on nothing. I'm not even looking for a historically correct story, but at least give me 'a story'. Does the script takes you through the rise and fall with napoleon in his storied life? Nope. Does the script deliver on war tactics, war action, or political strategy? Nope. How about love story between Napolean and Josephine? No. At least shed some lights on Napolean's personality and what drives him through his career? Nada. There isn't a story, at all. Instead you get glimpses of his life's major milestones in fast forward.And boy oh boy, despite the strong cast, you get some really poor acting in this movie. This is, by far, the worst performance by Phoenix I've ever watched. He's primarily 'wooden' in the entire movie start to finish. It's almost as if he sleep-walks through the entire movie. There's absolutely no way you actually connect with Napolean's character at all. Kirby's Josephine isn't much better. Most of the movie you really can't understand why she acts the way she does, if she actually has feelings for Napolean, and/or when or why.All in all, a total disaster of a movie. I gave it 5 stars because the set is amazing. Lots of attention to details with costume and set.

Napoleon,"I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan. His world building skill, whether it's historical or sci fi, always impressed me and leaves me enthralled. This movie just did not hit the spot. It reminded me of Killers of the Flower Moon. Terrible editing, cutting, and scene organization. And way too forced. Both movies tried to shove things in your face instead of just SHOWING you. And both movies suffered from the fault of having unreliable narrators. The narrator is the most powerful weapon in a movie, if the movie does choose to have a narrator. Why is Josephine the narrator? Why did they choose to create and frame her character as highly unlikeable, with that smug grin on her face that can't help but make you dislike her? And then you choose to give that character all of the power in the movie. That's why this movie should have been called Josephine. Also, this movie portrayed Napoleon as an intellectual dummy, and never really captured his tactical excellence as a military general. The battle scene of Austerlitz was one of the worst choices I have ever seen. That was Napoleon's masterpiece and I was stuck watching slow motion freeze frames of soldiers and horses drowning in the water. Gosh, there's so much more I could say about what went wrong with this movie but I'll just cut it here.","'m huge Ridley Scott fan . world building skill , whether 's historical sci fi , always impressed leaves enthralled . movie hit spot . reminded Killers Flower Moon .

Napoleon,"This evening I joined several others to watch Ridley Scott's new epic Napoleon. Being a well read student of Napoleonic history I have been looking forward to this for some time, although having seen one or two of the historical inaccuracies present in the trailer it did put me off, but I thought the battle scenes should be good. I was however wrong. Napoleon is a tawdry piece of effluence. The historical inaccuracies seen in the trailer are but a defecators flourish on the Mr Whippy style pile of excrement this film has become. Phoenix is plain terrible, unbelievable, childish... I thinking casting R2D2 in the role would have been more believable. The supporting cast, aside from Josephine, were instantly forgettable. Rupert Everett as Wellington was so uninspired and his one liners so full of cheese I swear he was sponsored by babybell. The score, script and acting made one think one was watching a channel 5 reconstruction of the life of Napoleon... this is probably doing them a disservice as even they of probably have read the lady bird book of Napoleons battles and perhaps had a game of Napoleon Total War before they committed pen to paper... Scott obviously thought such research was a waste of time and instead watched Black Panthers defence of Wakanda for practical tactical Napoleonic tips. Certain Waterloo bore more resemblance to some kind of trench warfare and was later inspired by Jar Jar Binx and the Gungans battle with the evil trade federation. In fact at one point I literally thought I was watching Monty Python's Batley Womensguild reenactment of the battle of pearl harbour. Suffice to say please, please, please don't watch this film if you have any interest in Napoleon or Napoleonic warfare. I don't know how much clearer I can be.Addendum: could Prussians please attack from the correct flank and perhaps acknowledge some other participators in the battle.","evening joined several others watch Ridley Scott 's new epic Napoleon . well read student Napoleonic history looking forward time , although seen one two historical inaccuracies present trailer put , thought battle scenes good . however wrong .

Napoleon,"Napoleon is a film that traces his career from the 1st significant battle that made him noticed, until his exile and death. It also covers his relationship with Josephine, with times of love, separation, and infidelity. At over 2-1/2 hours, it seems long, but in viewing, it seems to be an attempt at an Epic, but very rushed, as various characters seem to cameo and disappear. One example is Josephine's daughter, who seemed to appear out of nowhere, whrn Josephine was supposed to be infertile. I expect a longer Director's Cut would make more sense - either with an intermission, or in 2 or 3 Parts.A lot of the life of Napoleon can be easily researched, but it seems that Ridley Scott bent history to suit his idea of drama, and not logically. At the battle of Waterloo, Napoleon's cannons could hit the jumping-off point of Wellington's troops and beyond, but when the English troops marched forward in tight formations, the cannons were silent. All this drove me to look on the internet, which is not likely Scott's intention.I saw this in 70 mm, and some battle scenes would have benefitted from seeing an IMAX screening, but this film is destined for streaming, which appears to be a waste.","Napoleon film traces career 1st significant battle made noticed , exile death . also covers relationship Josephine , times love , separation , infidelity . 2-1/2 hours , seems long , viewing , seems attempt Epic , rushed , various characters seem cameo disappear .

Napoleon,"The title of my review refers to what the creator has done in ""Napoleon"", of course.Coming from such an acclaimed director as Ridley Scott and, therefore, so highly anticipated, it is a real shame that the film came out as a load of cringeworthy garbage. The fact that it contains so many historical inaccuracies is hardly its biggest problem. The issue is that the plot is silly and incoherent, with hardly a storyline, just relatively disjointed episodes, while the directing is boring, with zero psychological or emotional depth. Almost like reading Cliff Notes of Napoleon's biography with multiple pages torn out. So you are left dumbfounded as to why the creators have taken so many liberties with history, if what they replaced it with hardly made for a superior story that one could follow and watch. I mean, ""Braveheart"" was similarly historically inaccurate movie, but it had a story and character development viewers could relate to. None of that here.Much of the time is spent on covering Napoleon's relationship with Josephine. And I am not really going to take issue with the creators' main guiding thought: that all of Napoleon's actions that shaped the course of world history, were driven by what was happening in his relationship with Josephine. I'd be ready to cut some slack for poetic license in that regard, but this relationship in the movie comes out completely vapid and insipid, interspersed with sexual episodes of embarrassingly pointless nature, I mean some really buffoonish and cringey stuff. Josephine is depicted as an aloof emotionless woman, without any of the charm and intelligence the historical character was famous for. So one is left scratching his head why would anyone, let alone Napoleon, become obsessed with her, let alone find her as the source of inspiration for his deeds. If this film has been made as a drama about a complex and tortured love relationship, it fails at it miserably. I have read that the additional features in the longer 4-hour version of ""Napoleon"" will be mainly about the his relationship with Josephine. If so, I am glad I have seen the shorter version.It also fails as a historical epic and narrative. Beyond Napoleon and Josephine, all characters are presented in such a cursory way, that you can hardly distinguish one from another. And despite the generous accompanying captions, explaining when and where things take place, you can hardly follow what is happening to the bigger picture, even if you are familiar with the history and the personalities of the Napoleonic era.In true Ridley Scott fashion, the movie is rich visually. The battle scenes are reasonably well made, but are of limited length and consequence, lack dramatic climax, and are rife with unnecessary inaccuracies. So, as good as the visual effects are, they do not redeem the movie. The storming of Toulon and the battle of Waterloo looked pretty well, but the way the movie shows Austerlitz, the Egyptian campaign, and the invasion of Russia and Moscow is downright stupid, with some more really cringey and unjustifiably ahistorical stuff there. I mean, how hard was it to build a set that showed Moscow the way it really looked, given that many of its notable buildings remain intact and given how many depictions of the city at that time there are? No, the film's creators decide to spend lots of time and money to create some screamingly fake fantasyland instead.So, I am giving this movie three points for the visual spectacle that it is, plus the outstanding performance by Joaquin Phoenix. But both are completely overshadowed by the poorly written plot and wooden directing. If you are a Napoleonic Wars history buff, save yourself the trouble of watching this movie, and wait till battle scene clips from it appear on YouTube. You will thank me for this advice.","title review refers creator done `` Napoleon '' , course.Coming acclaimed director Ridley Scott , therefore , highly anticipated , real shame film came load cringeworthy garbage . fact contains many historical inaccuracies hardly biggest problem . issue plot silly incoherent , hardly storyline , relatively disjointed episodes , directing boring , zero psychological emotional depth .

Napoleon,"When i first heard about Ridley Scott making a Napoleon movie with Joaquin Phoenix as lead actor, i was very excited. Little that i knew that this movie would not match the expectations set. First of all i would like to state that i didn't expect an historically accurate movie given the fact that it is not Ridley Scott strongest suite (see Kingdom of Heaven). There is a small measure of truth in all of his movies but they are not built as a documentary and they are not intended to be one. Nevertheless, this movie doesn't even come close to the vibe given by Kingdom of Heaven or other historical movies, from an historical point of view. I always look for a particular type of energy in movies, especially in historical ones but Napoleon in my opinion fails to deliver. This movie tries to much to contain all peculiarities of Napoleon's life but fails miserably. We see all and nothing. The feeling that i got was that we saw a fast forward version of his life but without any soul or essence. Even the battle scenes seemed dull and without soul. I think Ridley set the bar too high through his previous movies for this part. Regarding Joaquin's performance, there is not much to say. I think his interpretation was similar to a performance you would see in a stage theater. I don't know why but at some points in the movie, it felt like a low budget movie with very poor writing and very poor dialogue. I will wait for the extended version to see if my opinion changes for the best.","first heard Ridley Scott making Napoleon movie Joaquin Phoenix lead actor , excited .

Napoleon,"Okay so this was one of my most anticipated movies of the year, so it frustrates me to say that Napoleon is my biggest disappointment 2023.I watched the film on the biggest IMAX screen in the world, in Leonberg, Germany.The scale is massive, the set-pieces are unprecedented, all the designs are great, Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is sublime, the score is exquisite and of course Ridley Scott exactly knows how to direct big scale kabooms (the battle on the ice is fantastic). But what does it have to say that's actually interesting? Having one of the all time greats Joaquin Pheonix play a notorious general as a bit of an idiot and seeing Vanessa Kirby shine is enjoyable, but at least half of the movie feel lifeless and bland. Never obtaining a feel of Napoleon as a character or, more significantly, his leadership skills.I'm sure the 4 hour cut is much better, but for now it's an unfocused, random, zero build up picture with moderate payoff.To give an example for the messy structure: Napoleon meets Zar Alexander I. They share drinks, talk about their mutual hatred for great britain and how they are going to be brothers. Then cut to an unrelated scene and directly after that Napoleon reads a letter -my dearest Josephine, the Russian dude stabbed me in the back, I'm going off to conquer him-. I could literally sense the frowning in my theater. Napoleon meets Josephine; next scene: -I cannot live without you-. There's simply no time to grow those feelings, making it feel organic. No chance for the audience to get emotionally hooked on the story thanks to that unfocused scene flow.Ridley Scott's (theatrical) Napoleon sadly is an emotionless juggernaut that uses its monumental battle sequences to hide the fact that it's a complete misfire in its attempt to explore anything personal between Napoleon and Josephine.5,5/10.","Okay one anticipated movies year , frustrates say Napoleon biggest disappointment 2023.I watched film biggest IMAX screen world , Leonberg , Germany.The scale massive , set-pieces unprecedented , designs great , Dariusz Wolski 's cinematography sublime , score exquisite course Ridley Scott exactly knows direct big scale kabooms ( battle ice fantastic ) . say 's actually interesting ? one time greats Joaquin Pheonix play notorious general bit idiot seeing Vanessa Kirby shine enjoyable , least half movie feel lifeless bland .

Napoleon,"This was one of my most expected movies of the year, I really like history and Im specially fascinated by the story of Napoleon, so I was very excited for this. I kinda doubted Phoenix was a good choice for napoleon, given that napoleon accomplished all he is remembered for at a very young age but I accepted it and thought it was to have just a good actor, but not even that was achieved with this movie. I can say, I HATE this movie, it portrays Napoleon as a stupid horny teen, all the movie is you watching Napoleon lust over his first wife Josefine, thats all. The only battle you see is the battle of Waterloo, his very last battle before being exiled. But before that nothing, you barely see any of his doing in Europe, theres no politics, no battles, no war, no side characters, no historical events, you only see his relationship, which sucks and has nothing to do with how anything happened in real life. It looks as if the director just read half of the article in wikipedio where it talks about Napoleon and his first wife and forgot to read the rest. This movie enfurates me and I hope no one actually thinks this is how napoleon actually was, because this is more like a cartoon of the man himself.","one expected movies year , really like history Im specially fascinated story Napoleon , excited . kinda doubted Phoenix good choice napoleon , given napoleon accomplished remembered young age accepted thought good actor , even achieved movie . say , HATE movie , portrays Napoleon stupid horny teen , movie watching Napoleon lust first wife Josefine , thats . battle see battle Waterloo , last battle exiled . nothing , barely see Europe , theres politics , battles , war , side characters , historical events , see relationship , sucks nothing anything happened real life . looks director read half article wikipedio talks Napoleon first wife forgot read rest . movie enfurates hope one actually thinks napoleon actually , like cartoon man .","one expect movi year , realli like histori Im special fascin stori napoleon , excit . kinda doubt phoenix good choic napoleon , given napoleon accomplish rememb young age accept thought good actor , even achiev movi . say , hate movi , portray napoleon stupid horni teen , movi watch napoleon lust first wife josefin , that . battl see battl waterloo , last battl exil . noth , bare see europ , there polit , battl , war , side charact , histor event , see relationship , suck noth anyth happen real life . look director read half articl wikipedio talk napoleon first wife forgot read rest . movi enfur hope one actual think napoleon actual , like cartoon man .",good,negative,-0.9839
Napoleon,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ridley Scott long ago etched his name on the list of filmmakers whose projects are nearly always interesting and deserving of a watch. After all, he has helmed such beloved classics as ALIEN (1979), BLADE RUNNER (1982), THELMA AND LOUISE (1991), and Best Picture winner GLADIATOR (2009). Returning to the historical epic genre and working from a script by his ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD writer, David Scarpa, Scott takes on the life and legend of Napoleon Bonaparte. Of course, that legend is a bit conflicted since Napoleon and his bicorne hat remains a hero to France, yet something less to England.With thousands of books written on Napoleon, most of us still possess only rudimentary knowledge of the man, even though we do understand his namesake 'complex'. One would think a movie that spans a quarter century and runs 2 hours and 38 minutes in length would sufficiently fill in the gaps, but unfortunately the result is a fascinating mess that wows mightily with its battle scenes, while mostly falling flat in every other area. This is especially disappointing since the film tries to juggle Napoleon's brilliance as a military leader, the muddled and complex politics of the era, and the strange obsession he held for Josephine de Beauharnais.Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix (JOKER, 2019) stars as Napoleon, and the exceptional Vanessa Kirby (PIECES OF A WOMAN, and The White Widow in the two most recent Mission Impossible movies) co-stars as Josephine. One can't help but fear the effect had this film been made without two such talented leads. Still, at least for me, there was a cold disconnect with Napoleon and Josephine, as we never quite grasp his military leadership, nor her hold on him.Director Scott kicks off the film by showing a bound Marie Antoinette (Catherine Walker) trudge through the angry masses on her way to the guillotine in 1789. Sound effects add to sense of realism, as does the executioner's final act of display. After this chilling sequence, a young Napoleon goes on his quest for battlefield victories, military promotions, more power, and a male heir.The battle scenes are truly epic and as spectacular as any we've seen on screen. Two particular standouts are the 1793 Siege of Toulon and the 1805 battle at Austerlitz. The first shows the brutality of war and gives us a glimpse of Napoleon's renowned strategic expertise, while the second has some remarkable footage on (and under) the frozen lake. In between these two are bits from Napoleon's conquests in 1798 Egypt and The Coup of 1799. Napoleon gains power with each step, and ultimately, his battlefield wins make him a hero at home where he ultimately claims the title of Emperor. Director Scott and Director of Photography Dariusz Wolski shine in this sequence and re-create the familiar Jacques-Louis David painting of the coronation.Unable to produce a male heir, Josephine must be cast aside and divorced, although their letters to and fro make up most of the film's structure of their relationship, even after divorce. The 1812 invasion of Russia is shown, as is Napoleon's exile to the Isle of Elba, where he escapes after a year to reclaim his power in France. Of course, we do know how this ends, as the brilliant military strategist meets his literal Waterloo at the hands of the Duke of Wellington (Rupert Everett). His second exile to St. Helena concludes with his death at age 51 in 1821.Ridley Scott's director cut is rumored to be an additional two hours in length and is supposedly headed to AppleTV+ in January. Although that is an incredibly long run time, Napoleon's short up-and-down life was filled with so many events (61 battles and more than 3 million deaths) and deserves a more complete telling than what this theatrical version offers. For those historians who are quick to point out inaccuracies, the well-known grump, Ridley Scott, has made his response to you quite clearly and succinctly.Opens in theaters on November 22, 2023.","Greetings darkness .

Napoleon,"This was one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. I made it toward the later half of the movie and everyone had already walked out, I decided to also walk out. It was the first film I ever walked out on. Here is why:Napoleon opens with what is seemingly going to be a historical biography film adaptation of Napoleon's life, what you instead get is a poorly made, half attempt at a comedy. That's not an exaggeration, it really does play out like a half attempted comedy that's neither funny nor entertaining.It starts in the French Revolution, the first problems was Joaquin Phoenix. I never thought he was a bad actor, but he's bad in this movie. Not only is he a bad Napoleon, not only is he way older looking than actual Napoleon (who is supposed to be 24 at the start of the film), but it's like he didn't even wanna play the role. I don't know what he was going for here but what we got is a bumbling fool with no confidence in any regard, no sign of intelligence, no backstory, no character development, no knowledge of his life outside of his marriage, and above all no historical accuracy whatsoever.This isn't only Joaquin Phoenix's fault, it's Ridley Scott and writer David Scarpa too. Everyone failed this project.If what you were looking for is a film about the Napoleonic Wars, look elsewhere. There is almost no war in it, and what little war there was, is only little clips of warfare, and then straight back to Napoleon's marriage life. Even if you found the marriage stuff interesting about Napoleon, this still isn't the movie for you, because it's not accurate and the film makes it's point early on, but for some reason they keep going over the same ground already covered about Napoleon's love life. It get's very repetitive and quite frankly, boring.These clips of combat we get are completely disconnected from the story, it looks like it's randomly thrown in. They're also really short. If you remember, the trailer has combat in Egypt. You see all that combat in the trailer, that's it. There's no more of it. The trailer was better than the movie.As a history buff (especially history on the French Revolution/Napoleonic Wars) and a film buff, it comes off as offensive to the entire subject matter it's covering in history, offensive to the entire art form of filmmaking, and offensive to the intelligence of it's viewer.It takes nothing seriously, all these huge events regardless of your opinion is treated with disrespect.But most historical events are absent from this film. It focuses so heavily on this marriage story that you don't care about it because the film never tried to make you care, to the point where you feel shocked to see how much time has passed and how many events they skipped when you finally see a date pop up on the screen or an actual recognizable event.Or if you don't know Napoleonic history, you will be entirely lost as to what's happening because it explains nothing, it doesn't even mention why the Napoleonic Wars is happening at all. It doesn't even cover Napoleon growing as a general. Or even growing as a person. The look of Napoleon is even lazily done in this.This version of Napoleon is such a fool instead of a smart general, he makes Napoleon Dynamite look like a cool, collected, Chad.From a film making perspective, the movie is horribly made, generic to bad camera work, a bland soundtrack, HORRIBLE writing, a plot that goes nowhere.The only positives I can find is that some of the costume design is good, the sets are pretty well made, and the one scene in the trailer with the ice was cool. But I'd say watch the trailer again instead of the movie. But that's it. Those are the only good things.If you like Napoleon you won't like this, if you hate Napoleon you won't like this. If you like history you won't like this. If you don't care about history you won't like this. It's poorly made and boring for all. Find any other Napoleon focused movie and I'm sure it will be more entertaining.The trailer makes it seem like a different movie. I feel scammed, I feel lied to.A history film about the Napoleonic Wars with no history, no Napoleonic Wars, and an inaccurate Napoleon that's not fun to watch and at times straight up cringe to witness, makes this movie a solid 1. No entertainment value.","one worst big budget movies ever seen . made toward later half movie everyone already walked , decided also walk . first film ever walked . : Napoleon opens seemingly going historical biography film adaptation Napoleon 's life , instead get poorly made , half attempt comedy .

Napoleon,"Napoleon is one of the most evil and grotesque persons in all of human history. Leaving a trail of bodies, destruction and misery as he tried to conquer everything in sight. Although some of his megalomaniac traits are shown here, he is still the protagonist and as such the writers and director find both redeeming traits and very inaccurate history to showcase.I am really, really tired of Hollywood rewriting history over and over again...The worst about this movie is however how tedious and boring it is. The entire ""love Story"", which take up way too much of the movie, is not sold at all. Not even the two leads, both excellent actors normally, aren't able to sell it to us in the audience. The run time is bloated beyond reason which ads to the tiresome boringness which is this movie.The sound design is very good, and most of the cinematography holds very well. Those traits together with a few excellent scenes save the movie from becoming a complete disaster, but this cannot be recommended to anyone.If you want to be bored out your mind watching a weirdly written movie which spits on real history, a movie which is all over the place, then perhaps give this a go. But for me this is a 3/10.I cannot remember the last time I was this bored at the cinema. Bring a pillow and be prepare to sleep.","Napoleon one evil grotesque persons human history .

Napoleon,"I still don't know what to say about the film. Fantastic equipment, great backdrops, the battle scenes as intense and haunting as they haven't been since Saving Private Ryan. In France the film is perceived as a national affront. And what should I say? That's right.Despite the initial praise, the film is a disaster. The script and direction are a mess. There is so much history - to put it nicely: inaccurate - the portrayal of the people is a complete failure. Napoleon is presented as a minor, characterless, horny goat, cowardly, without any charm or charisma. Now I am not a fan of this man, who undoubtedly has the blood of hundreds of thousands on his fingers, and I cannot understand the adoration for him that still exists in France to this day. But the depiction in the film is wrong. Simply discrediting.Now you can say that this is a satire, but again he is not caustic and not smart enough for that. For a comedy, it largely lacks any sense of humor. The character drawing is too imprecise for a biography (why Phoenix played Napoleon like he had played the Joker is beyond my comprehension) and superficial. As a historical film, this is too wrong (just as a few examples at the very beginning: Why does the film start with the execution of Marie Antoinette, at which Napoleon was not actually present? Was this bloody shudder needed? Or the fall of Robbespiere? None of this mattered to Napoleon at the time because he was in Toulon. I stop here, it is just too much, too much for such a movie). It doesn't work as a drama either.The only character drawn with a minimum of sympathy was Josephine. The film is a massive anti-French work, historically wrong, and all in all questionable. In the end everything leads to the fact that an Englishman has to save Europe. The fact that many others were involved is completely ignored. Blücher's Prussians hardly appear at Waterloo, and the Battle of Leipzig is not even mentioned. According to the film, 560,000 deaths in the Russian campaign were the reason for Napoleon's banishment. Not the defeat at Leipzig, which was the largest battle in Europe before World War I - but there were no British fighting there either and so it seems to be not of importance for director Scott.This film becomes more and more of a nuisance the longer it drags on. The bad thing: Generations of film-only viewers will now take this as historical truth.","still n't know say film .

Napoleon,"All right ! Ridley Scott is a master when it comes to battle scenes and there are 500 extras to direct. But, please, why have you respected historical truth so little!At the time of Marie-Antoinette's beheading (magnificent scene, treated in a very realistic manner), Bonaparte was 24 years old, not 49 (age of Phoenix at time of filming)!In the crowd, he's seen watching the queen's execution, with a sullen face. But his presence was completely impossible, because throughout the second part of 1793, the young general was in the South for the siege of Toulon.Furthermore, at the time, he wore his hair long to his shoulders.When he married Joséphine, in March 1796, he was 26 and she was 32.As much as Vanessa Kirby is credible for her role, the choice of Joaquin Phoenix (who always looks grumpy and tired) is catastrophic, except in the last half hour of this disappointing film.","right !

Napoleon,"This is unfortunately Ridley's worst film. From the start the plot feels improvised, as if like he left the actors play and do they're own thing. He had a marquee set of actors, but non of them stand out including Joaquin Phoenix which compared with his performance in Gladiator (first Ridley's film with him) it is a long fall, anyone could have done that part. The screenplay is also clumsy, feels like some sort of documentary without a narrator. And the worst part is that Ridley's interpretation of Napoleon, he puts the main character as a ridiculous man who didn't have any merit and his accomplishments were reached by chance. The war scenes are the only parts of this movie we can rescue, where Ridley is a master.

No one is likeable in this slanted history of France and Europe.Some people will probably enjoy this depiction, but I felt the director was determined to shows France as corrupt and full of self-absorbed leaders.Napoleon was occasionally depicted as a good general, but mostly as a childlike presence under the humiliating thumb of his chosen woman... a nymphomaniac for everyone but her husband.The battle scenes displayed an obvious hate for western civilization, showing only the ugly side of war, blown off limbs, dead horses, ( Napoleon reaches in and pulls a cannon ball from his dead horse's chest to have it sent to his mother ) and never a moment of celebration. The movie is shot with continual bad weather, dreariness, and many non-historical events used to highlight war's cruelty and savagery. Not once was eagerness of the officers or fighting men to grow an empire, enjoy success, and show gallantry presented.There is no humor, no lightness, nothing uplifting (except one scene where Napoleon actually inspires some troops not to shoot him). It is mostly a continual drone of ""The evils of Western civilization"". I walked out of the movie twice to get snacks, knowing I wasn't missing anything of importance.The audience saw few uplifting moments, but a disregard for historical accuracy. Soldiers with muskets can't fire their weapons in the rain. No battles took place on a frozen lake. Brilliant maneuvers were absent for the most part and success was visually muted.So, this isn't a movie for history lovers or people who expect to be uplifted or impressed.

Napoleon,"Just watched it and God Daimn it was terrible even without taking into account the historical accuracy.A more fitting name for this movie would be ""Josephine"".Literally 70% of the movie was her siting with Napoleon in silence, her being intimate with him or her cheating on him with other men and Napoleon being a complete weakling about it. There is so much time spent about Josephine that there is legit only like 3 battle scenes in the whole movie! It was very boring, at least for me.Moreover the pace of the movie is just awful. If I was someone that knows nothing about Napoleon other than he was one of the greatest conquerors of all time I would be confused as heck. On one moment Napoleon is putting down a monarchist rebellion and on the other he's being crowned Emperor. Like what? How? One moment Napoleon makes his iconic disastrous retreat from Russia and on the other he's already abdicating. By the way this means they literally skipped how Napoleon's downfall played out, like how Europe and even his Marshalls turned against him. Great.Also I felt like there was a lack of information about the world in general. Why is Napoleon fighting the Uk, Prussia, Austria and Russia? We don't know. Why did Napoleon decide to invade Russia? Your guess is as good as mine!Anyway, to finish this off, There is NO mention of Napoleon's Marshalls, NO mention of Napoleon's military strategies, NO mention of Napoleon's reforms, NO showcase of why people followed this man to battle.Basically, *NO EXPLANATION ON WHY NAPOLEON WAS ONE THE GREATEST CONQUERORS OF HIS TIME*

Napoleon,"First, let me get this out of the way. If you want to watch a focused masterpiece, watch Waterloo with Rod Steiger and Christopher Plummer. It could have only been better (for me) if Steiger had a French accent. Second, if you want to watch a general scoping history of Napoleon, consider the excellent and approachable Napoleon series with Christian Clavier (with a French accent), Isabella Rossallini, John Malkovich and Gerard Depardieu. (Clavier is sometimes unfairly maligned when indeed he does a splendid job in my view.) There are other well-reputed less approachable versions, but these two are excellent.Now, as this work, let's start with Napoleon. A boyishly handsome, philosophically grounded (Napoleonic Code), egotistical, pugnacious genius, sometimes brooding sometimes loving, sometimes playing. That is, a strategically gifted, tactically trained, boyishly handsome, egotistical, passionate, lovable, fighting, moody, young genius.I am sorry, but this character requires someone like a young Brando or Pacino. Phoenix simply cannot, no-way, pull it off. Way wrong. Crazy wrong. He does not have the range. He is a great actor only in a particular type of role, a crouching villainous Caesar or a depressive Joker. A melancholic low-key whispering introverted Napoleon does not work, and some form of delusion by Scott allowed or put Phoenix into this role. I can easily get past failure of boyish good looks and the way wrong age (and Napoleon's young age is part of the story itself). But I cannot get past whispering tone and failure of charisma, passion and charm. Napoleon seduced a lot of people in a lot of ways.It's not Phoenix's fault he was miscast. Way miscast. Vanessa Kirby was fine and did her job. But, no one in this movie deserves any acting nominations. Take one common scene, being the ""Will you shoot your emperor?"" following Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to France, the other referenced Napoleons had timing, tension, and drama, here blah, nothing. Nothing! It's just bad. Really bad.Nothing in this movie taught me anything, made me think, made me feel, or moved me in any way. Terribly unengaging. Even the couple attempts at comic relief (if there would have been any tension, which was devoid) it was misplaced and failed miserably.Now, let's talk about the versions. This is the 2.5H version and there is another 4H version to be released by Apple+. Everything is a gimmick these days. Every streaming channel has one gem, but I'll suggest this work is inherently flawed by miscast Phoenix and more time to blend the scenes won't do it. In this 2.5H version, it's like a bunch of scenes without any context. We go from the French Revolution through the Reign of Terror through Napoleon's coup through Austerlitz through first defeat through Elba through return to France through Waterloo, through St. Helena. In 2.5H, even with the right actor who has engaging charisma and charm, it's too much ground. No character development whatsoever. None. Even in 4H it's like getting two bad suits for the price of one. It's just more of what's bad, which is miscast Phoenix in the titular role. I only understood the movie because I love and know the history. My wife and 86 year old father could not follow it, and my 19 year old daughter (somewhat tired from returning from college) dozed off a couple of times. No one liked the movie. And we even went out of our way to the IMAX because, well, it was Napoleon.I almost forgot to mention the emasculation of Napoleon by Josephine, the jarring politically correct now-required social normalizing casting of extras, and the ending credits that count the dead but give no context for the concomitant social reforms.Braveheart was historically all wrong, but it was still a great story with a wonderful score. This Napoleon is a bad story, and, even if Napoleon was a fictional character it was still bad. It's both a bad reflection of a real man, a grossly incomplete historical depiction, and a bad story poorly told no matter what.Napoleon was loved, hated, admired and ridiculed, by many of the same people, at different times. He was, if nothing else, one of the greatest characters in the recorded history of mankind. To try to do it all fairly, with the wrong titular actor, is silly. Really silly. Delusively silly.Sir Ridley's movie The Last Duel failed for a similar reason, and then he blames the audience. It's not the production or even perhaps the precise movie direction that is going wrong, it's that the story itself is not well-told. Perhaps it's time for him to teach his tactical craft to a young person with the right vision for the story expression.I need to watch my Waterloo DVD again to get my head back to the right flavor of Napoleon the Great, not Napoleon the Whisperer.Nothing good, new or better. A waste of my time and money.","First , let get way . want watch focused masterpiece , watch Waterloo Rod Steiger Christopher Plummer . could better ( ) Steiger French accent .

Napoleon,"Kind of disappointed in this movie. Had very high expectations given the cast and Ridley Scott's direction. But the pacing is not great they were not able to spend adequate time on the politics and war strategy for which he was so famed. Too much time spent on the personal relationship between him and his wife. They especially rushed his exiles and return.Not sure that Joaquin Phoenix was a good choice for Napoleon, he could not get rid of his American accent so you had the lead with an American accent and the rest of the cast with British accents, it did not gel well.

Napoleon,"Why would a film maker direct a historical era movie if he has no interest in that history? Ridley Scott was asked about the many inaccuracies in the movie, and he said ""Were you there?"" His response is as idiotic as it is childish. Of course there are many things that are known about the subject of this film.The movie, even ignoring the lack of accuracy, isn't very interesting. Although the movie focuses on Napoleon's relationship with Josephine, that relationship isn't very compelling. Trying to take on the entirety of Napoleon's career is probably too much to handle for a single film.There probably are a number of people who don't know much about Napoleon.

Napoleon,"I'll keep this simple as I feel like throwing up after having seeing this disaster of a "" historical epic"" . Ill focus on the battles and realism / authenticity there. Everyone else have already magnified how much it wastes time with boring drama and Josefine.Nr 1: Zero proper emphasis on battles. In a film called Napoleon. Already a waste of money from that fact alone. False advertising.Nr 2: Cringe worthy.... depiction of Waterloo. If you've seen the Waterloo from 1970... you will pull out your hair at sheer frustration when you see what they've done here. Let alone the basic depictions of the battle in Egypt and Austerlitz. It's indescribably embarassing... and you feel it, knowing the historical facts.There isn't a single historically accurate thing about any.... of these battles. It's mindboggling.Nr 3: Sniper rifle scopes on Baker rifles . X__X . Portrayed as being able to take a clean shot at well over a kilometer. Let alone Napoleons tent... being within a kilometer. More like 600 meters. This is grotesquely .... idiotic and completely absurd. Nobody on this bothered to remotely give a single damn about accurate military tactics and knowledge of Napoleonic weaponry.4: Napoleon charges the front line.... and engages in what is well zoomed out to appear as the most cringeworthy McDonalds LARP experience ever. There are so.... few troops on the map. All in thin lines, completely detached from any proper support or logic of battle line formations. With a budget of multimillions... you couldn't bother even hiring enough extras?You dont even see light infantry, Voltiguer or Chasseur support during the advance or at any point. And the cavalry charge rushes up in front of the infantry advance at Waterloo ..... engaging in a pointless failed charge at like 200 meters just to run in circles for eons. Rendering musket fire now an impossibility lest you wish friendly fire. Same idiotic part happened in the Austerlits battle. This is not... what actually happened. You're making a mockery of history. Everything is made to look completely stupid in a state that concern life and death.This is Game of Thrones Season 8.... level of CRINGE portrayal of so called "" Warfare / War strategy""Save yourself your precious time.... and your money. And go kick back with the 1970 movie instead. Dont be fooled by the year and suspect it doesn't hold up. It's an extremely well made military epic that holds up because contrary to this McDonalds experience Ridley wants you to charge bloody 20 dollars for just to spit in your face, the 1970 film went above and beyond to show you the most spectacular portrayal of Napoleonic mass warfare to date, utilizing thousands of extras in superb uniforms with practical effects and attention to detail all around. And most importantly.... trying to be as historically accurate as possible.Something we'll never see again alike what Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings.You'll have to be out of your senses if you wanna sit for 4 hours on the streaming platform and watch this again with another 90 minutes of THIS QUALITY.... of historical filmmaking. NO THANKS.This isn't Kingdom of Heaven, people. This isnt the same Ridley Scott as back then. This is the Alien: Covenant Ridley.Now I'll go watch Rod Steiger portray a strong proud emperor with flaws, love in his heart and ultimately meeting his end in a spectacular battle he almost won... and let that burn out the memory of this cringeworthy incorrect display of not just Napoleon, but also of military warfare 200 years ago in general.Everyone who saw this without existing knowledge of Napoleonic warfare... is now massively dumber because of you, Ridley.Great contribution to more of this Mcdonalds era of filmmaking.","'ll keep simple feel like throwing seeing disaster `` historical epic '' .

In the long war against Napoleon the Brits thought up an applied practically every insult. That is fine, every side does that. But we don't have to believe it. And Scott did not need to make a film centered on laughable and debunked claims.Napoleon was, simply put, in the top five military and political geniuses in human history.

We see some tactical genius, but in this film we get none of the strategic genius.Finally we get no picture of Napoleon as the ultimate self made man, and for whatever motive, the pinnacle of actual export of revolution; which is exactly what he was, and why he was hated and feared by the early 19th century status quo.","4/10 . idea Josephine Bonaparte power well understood historians British calumny Napoleon . long war Napoleon Brits thought applied practically every insult . fine , every side . n't believe .

Napoleon,"This film is a turkey - not just because all of Ridley Scott's films on French history have bombed, or because brooding, drug-addict playing, mouth-filled-with-gravel Joaquin Phoenix completely misplays the part of Napoleon, or because Vanessa Kirby is a medium-talent actress playing a part way above her abilities - but because the script is very evidently horrible. Ridley's editing of that script during production is itself evidence that it's horrible, and it was undoubtedly made more horrible due to the director's ill-advised intervention. The proof is in the result - rather, the lack of a cinematic-quality result. This Thanksgiving season, I'm thankful that Sergei Bonarchuk, H. A. L. Craig, Vittorio Bonicelli,
Mario Soldati, and Rod Steiger had the skill and vision to bring a pitch-perfect cinematic portrayal of Napoleon to the big screen in ""Waterloo,"" which will stand all the taller in contrast to this hellacious piece of garbage.","film turkey - Ridley Scott 's films French history bombed , brooding , drug-addict playing , mouth-filled-with-gravel Joaquin Phoenix completely misplays part Napoleon , Vanessa Kirby medium-talent actress playing part way abilities - script evidently horrible .

Napoleon,"Saw Napoleon at an early morning screening--and left after 2 hours (it runs just under 3). As the title character, Joaquin Phoenix gives one of the worst performances by a professional actor I've ever seen. He seems overwhelmed by the costumes and pageantry, coming across as stiff to the point of a waxen figure. The speeches are rendered ln the voice of a frightened 5th grader reciting the Gettsyburg Address. Phoenix doesn't have a single believable--or lifelike, moment in the movie. Vanessa Kirby, who's a fine actress, does as well as she can as Josephine, playing against the deathly awful Phoenix. The battle scenes are, per Ridley Scott, thunderous. But why Scott allowed Phoenix to play Napoleon as a sleepwalker is something the box office will answer. Save YOUR money.","Saw Napoleon early morning screening -- left 2 hours ( runs 3 ) . title character , Joaquin Phoenix gives one worst performances professional actor 've ever seen . seems overwhelmed costumes pageantry , coming across stiff point waxen figure . speeches rendered ln voice frightened 5th grader reciting Gettsyburg Address .

Napoleon,"I was genuinely looking forward to this film so I am sad that it ultimately ended up being a big disappointment. The visuals and costume designs are top notch. The battles look spectacular and are very gritty. All though if you are hoping on a reenactment of the actual battles you will be disappointed. Ridley Scott brings the visuals but he does not come close to Waterloo (1970) in terms of staying true to historical accuracy on the battlefield. Let's get into it!This film in my opinion has two major problems. The scope of the film is waaay too big. It feels like we are jumping around from scene to scene without an understanding of why this was happening. It just sort of happens. In short, this film starts at the end of the French Revolution and ends when Napoleon dies on St- Helena. The glue that ties the film all together is his bizarre relationship with his wife Josephine. This ultimately fails to do just that. The scenes with Josephine take up way to much screentime, considering there is no real development in their relationship. It begins complicated and it stays complicated. I have no problem with showing us this complicated relationship with Josephine but it didn't warrant that much screentime. Time that could have been used to flesh out the story. Why does the battle of Austerlitz happen? What is the conclusion of said battle? What does it mean for Napoleon and France? Why did Napoleon undertake this grand but ultimately failed campaign in Russia? This film touches upon all of the key events without tying it up in a coherent story. Is this a film about Napoleon and his wife or a film about Napoleon the great general? I am fine with either one but Ridley Scott would have been better off choosing between either or the other. Does this sound like another Ridley Scott film? Yes it absolutely does! Kingdom of Heaven was a disaster when it came out. Luckily, he fixed Kingdom of Heaven with his Directors cut. There is still hope for Napoleon because Ridley Scott has already hinted at a four- hour-long version being released on Apple tv in 2024. I can only hope that he manages to bring context and understanding to all these key events. Just introducing the politicking of the time would go a long way in making the film more interesting and tie all the key events together.Something that cannot be fixed however, is the second problem. Joaquin Phoenix's poor and one-dimensional portrayal of Napoleon the Loner. Boy oh boy! I never thought I say it aloud but he lacks the range to play someone as complex like Napoleon. Loner Napoleon in this film is a whiny little man-boy. He is socially awkward and emotionally distant and cannot connect with anyone. The scene where the soldiers drop their weapons to join him was more out of pity than admiration I feel. I actually thought Vanessa Kirby as Josephine did pretty well all things considered. But it's really hard to shine when the man opposing you just cannot seem to connect with you on the screen. Where was the brilliant and charismatic leader that Napoleon undoubtedly was? Where was the coldhearted calculated Napoleon that didn't care how many troops he lost on the battlefield? Where was the great administrator or the Napoleon that introduced the Napoleontic Code (That to this day is still relevant)? There are many facets to play a character like Napoleon. It's hard to cover them all in one film. The script undoubtedly did not help Joaquin by focusing way too much time on him and his wife. But even the moments he is on campaign with his troops he never connected with anyone. Loner Napoleon would have a hard time convincing me he could march a group of kids to a candy store, let alone march an army of tens of thousands of troops to the battlefield.I'll end with this, Napoleon is a man who against all odds went on a mad journey through life. I just wanted a film that showed me something of that madness. The good and the bad. The film lacked coherency to give us that and suffered from Loner Napoleons inability to move and inspire others and that's ultimately why I think this film is a big disappointment. I also fear that Loner Napoleon will stand in the way of Riddley Scotts abillity to fix this film in the Directors cut, but i hope i am wrong.","genuinely looking forward film sad ultimately ended big disappointment . visuals costume designs top notch . battles look spectacular gritty . though hoping reenactment actual battles disappointed .

Napoleon,"I read the reviews of Ridley Scott's 'Napoleon' and knew it was not the great film everyone anticipated. Even so, I went. And what I discovered is that it's bad in the worst kind of way; It is dull. Lifeless. A flat un-involving story about characters who are in every way unlikable. Another reviewer wrote that he / she had trouble staying awake through its 2 hours 40 minutes run-time. When I read that I laughed. Now that I have seen the film, I am laughing no longer.Napoleon Bonaparte as Emperor of France did a lot of good things; much of the country's 'Civil Code' was instituted during his reign. But this film deals only with (a) Napoleon the warrior and (b) Napoleon the husband, and fails to deliver a well-rounded character in either sense. We know he loves France but aside from living there we don't know what drives his passion. His hatred for anything not France is clear, but the reasons for this hatred are never explained. There are battles a'plenty but the reason for them is elusive. Enemies become friends. Friends become enemies. We care about none of them. Thousands die. Somehow we care nothing about them either.There is, in Napoleon, no one to root for. Making matters worse there is an uneven performance by Joaquin Phoenix. His 'later' Napoleon becomes a different character than we'd seen earlier in the film. And no, I don't think it is attributed to Napoleon's rise in power. I think it's Phoenix; his acting, his portrayal. His Napoleon is far less quirky as the film progresses (as though the actor wants out of his role), and in this way, he is far less interesting.If there's anyone about whom we do care that character would be Josephine, Napoleon's wife and Empress of France. Vanessa Kirby is ravishing in the role. A rare beauty but one with a shadow-filled past as well as future. We can understand Napoleon's undying love her but the truth is, she's not the nicest girl on the block. There's little doubt that Mr. Bonaparte would never have 'won' her, were he not the country's future leader. So, again, no one to truly root for.Ah, yes. The battle scenes. They're fine (though it seems as though a battle fought at the base of Egypt's pyramids was cut out). But I think fewer battles and more unraveling of the reasons behind those battles between France, England, Russia, Austria, and other countries might make the remaining battles more meaningful.More involving.Which, as I said, this film is definitely not.","read reviews Ridley Scott 's 'Napoleon ' knew great film everyone anticipated .

Napoleon,"Back in 2005 Ridley Scott's 144 minute version of 'Kingdom of Heaven' premiered in theatres to somewhat mixed reviews. A couple of years later the vastly superior 190 minute director's cut version finally arrived, with the general consensus that the final product was a masterclass in storytelling, directing, acting and cinematography. - without doubt the best motion picture ever made about the crusades.Almost 20 years later we are yet again treated with a compiled highlight reel of a Ridley Scott movie in the theatre, rather than a full-fledged historical epic, since it has already become official that 'Napoleon' will be released later on streaming with its entire runtime of almost four hours, which clearly is needed to flesh out many parts of the movie and fill in the emotional and historical blanks, because this - somewhat butchered cut - moves in a breakneck speed and feels too rushed.Whereas the underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo' starring Rod Steiger as Napoleon Bonaparte, featuring thousands of extras, portrayed events only during the 100 days campaign in 1815, Scott's 'Napoleon' takes us through decades of various major events and battles beginning with the siege of Toulon in 1793. In this version we never really learn why Napoleon was so powerful. Why did he win the admiration of so many? It's almost as if he stumbles through greatness. He was a great politician in real life, but here he is portrayed as a childish brute? It felt like the focus was more on setpieces and his troubled relationship with Josephine, than on him as a ruthless and cunning emperor, and in the theatre cut there really isn't a lot of places where Joaquin Phoenix truly shines as an Oscar contender. Maybe the director's cut will remedy that.In spite of its shortcomings (no pun intended) 'Napoleon' is still one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I am baffled. Because if people can sit through 3+ hour box office hits like 'Avengers Endgame', 'Avatar 2' and 'Oppenheimer' - why the need to release just a very extended trailer of 'Napoleon' in the theatre, especially when everyone know that they can just wait a couple of months for it to arrive on streaming in its entirety? An attempt by Apple at a cash grab? ""You need a subscription to our streaming service to watch the whole thing""?With that being said, I do predict some Oscar nominations here. Ridley Scott yet again proves why he is one of the best filmmakers out there. But a word of caution: If you only plan to see this once, you might consider waiting for the director's cut.","Back 2005 Ridley Scott 's 144 minute version 'Kingdom Heaven ' premiered theatres somewhat mixed reviews . couple years later vastly superior 190 minute director 's cut version finally arrived , general consensus final product masterclass storytelling , directing , acting cinematography . - without doubt best motion picture ever made crusades.Almost 20 years later yet treated compiled highlight reel Ridley Scott movie theatre , rather full-fledged historical epic , since already become official 'Napoleon ' released later streaming entire runtime almost four hours , clearly needed flesh many parts movie fill emotional historical blanks , - somewhat butchered cut - moves breakneck speed feels rushed.Whereas underappreciated 1970 movie 'Waterloo ' starring Rod Steiger Napoleon Bonaparte , featuring thousands extras , portrayed events 100 days campaign 1815 , Scott 's 'Napoleon ' takes us decades various major events battles beginning siege Toulon 1793 . version never really learn Napoleon powerful . win admiration many ?

Napoleon,"NapoleonLet's start with the good things. The battle scenes are well shot, exciting, horrifying, the excellent work one can expect from a Ridley Scott movie.Josephine was fantastic. Her situation was clearly not ideal, and the actress portrayed her in such a way that I felt more for her than anyone else in the film.Now the bad things. All of it. This movie was not good at all. It was such a disappointment. This film had major problems with the flow of the story. It was extremely disjointed. I had no understanding of what was happening as it felt like someone took an outline and only filmed the bullet points, and not the detail beneath it. There is no transition from the coup in 1799 to the coronation in 1804. There is no explanation. There is no context as to how and why this was even acceptable.And don't get me started on historical inaccuracies. The very first scene shows Marie Antoinette getting beheaded in 1789 when that amazing invention called google can tell you otherwise.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh but I've studied English and French history quite extensively and it was cringe worthy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix was also very much miscast. I felt sorry for Vanessa Kirby as she was the highlight of the film. In all honesty, this film should have been called Josephine.I do not recommend watching this unless you're just there for the well shot battle scenes. The lake scene will give you chills.

Napoleon,"If I knew nothing of Napoleon, I'd be utterly confused about what was happening in this film. There is no hero's journey to follow and nobody to root for.Who is Napoleon?

No idea.Early on we meet Josephine's minor son who is never seen again on screen after a one-on-one meeting with Napoleon. Why does Napoleon meet with him? Why does he grant his request? Why is he interested in Josephine? No idea.The film feels as if you're a time traveller who is moving forward to different snapshots of Napoleon's life. There's little context or explanation. Lots of battle scenes, troop movement, flag signaling and even smelting to make munitions but not a lot of context. Why is Napoleon going here or there? No idea. What is his end goal? No idea. Why do Napoleon's men have an affinity for him? No idea.There are large spans of time between scenes so suddenly Josephine's daughter is a grown adult speaking with Napoleon. No clue who she was until Napoleon mentioned Josephine being her mother. Who are all of these people? No idea. How are they connected? No idea.The film is beautifully shot. The costuming is perfection. The set design is dreamy.

Napoleon,"The movie's only purpose is to prove Ridley Scott's greatness by portraying Napoleon in a very degrading way. To do that Scott basically lies through the whole movie.Nothing has happened like it's in the movie. Not even the battles. In a battle we see Napoleon butchering all the austrians on ice. Never happened. We also see Napoleon to butcher unarmed civilians in Paris. Never happened. We see the russian tsar as a cool kid who defeated Napoleon. Yeah Napoleon lost many man due to famine and diseases. But the movie ""forget"" to highlight that the tsar sacrificed his own citizens just to hunger Napoleon. He burned his own cities and grain fields to make Napoleon unable to feed his men. All in all the tsar destroyed his own population to stop Napoleon. But the movie portrays him as a charming kid and Napoleon as some kind of monster...Not to mention the law and justice system Napoleon established. Code Civil brought equality to all the people in France. Half of the world adopted it. Basically it is the root of nowadays justice system. He demolished noble privileges and gave people equal rights. Not surprising the movie not even mentions these facts. It was way more important to show one more bizarre unpleasing sex scene.This movie is a disgusting attempt to discredit Napoleon.

Napoleon,"This movie must have cost a fortune to make. (There is no budget listed yet here on IMDB.) You would think they could have spent a little of it on a good script. So many of the problems here stem from the bad script, which does not provide clues about what it going on.What we get is several large-scale but very unexciting battle scenes, where we watch the infantry march into suicidal battle, sometimes led by the cavalry, sometimes followed. In a movie about a fabled tactician, there is no discussion of what made him a success, what he did differently, etc.In between the battle episodes are some of the least romantic, un-erotic love scenes ever filmed. Phoenix and his leading lady have absolutely NO chemistry whatsoever. Half the time he is like a statue with her, the other half like an over-eager dog. We never get a hint of what he might see in her.I stayed through the whole 2.5 hours because I was with friends. Otherwise I would have left mid-way through, or fallen asleep - as Napoleon does several times himself during the battle scenes.I saw Oppenheimer, which is a full three hours long, three times last summer, and was riveted to it all three times. That movie was well directed. This movie didn't hold me at all, had no pacing, and was sometimes confusing even though I have studied that period of French history.Some will find fault with historical inaccuracies. There are evidently a fair number of them. But that doesn't bother me. What bothered me was that Scott and his crew never made this story come alive.

Napoleon,"A new low in Scott's career, which is turning into quite a feat.It saddens me to say that the once great and adored director of instant classics (The Duelists, Alien, Gladiator, Blade Runner... he made at least 3 of my all time favorite 10 movies) keeps turning out total turds (the new Alien movies come to mind), atrocious.The Last Duel was already pretty boring and took the crown of the most stupid helmet ever depicted in a movie, EVER!! But this new monstrosity really takes the cake.Some of the worst problems:
Napoleon (whom I do not like as a historic person, so I'm not a hurt fanboy) doesn't age and is nearly too old for the last scenes, let alone the early once. Neither actor nor make up department nor special affects make ANY effort to show the passage of time, it's ridiculous, an obviously near 50 year old Phoenix with Phoenix' very familiar near 50 year old face plays a 24 up to 45 y/o man without any distinction in between. It really takes one out of the movie.Also, so many historic lies. You read the list; the shooting of the pyramids, the meeting with Wellington ('boats', WTF?!?), him leading cavalry charges as an expert horsemen, it's appalling.How will history react to a movie about the life of Hitler in 125 years when some hack director decides that he met Churchill or FDR and was riding tanks into the battle of Kursk... will that hack then defend this crap by saying ""where you there?"", the most ignorant *and* arrogant statement towards history I've ever heard off...
I'm not even going into this Josephine obsession, and how all the event and battles lack any introduction or context, they just happen, and Napoleon, as mentioned above, looks the same.You get it, I hate this movie and I hate the director for his arrogance for cheating us out of a decent Napoleon movie for at least another generation after this one's (I'm assuming) abysmal failure.","new low Scott 's career , turning quite feat.It saddens say great adored director instant classics ( Duelists , Alien , Gladiator , Blade Runner ... made least 3 time favorite 10 movies ) keeps turning total turds ( new Alien movies come mind ) , atrocious.The Last Duel already pretty boring took crown stupid helmet ever depicted movie , EVER ! ! new monstrosity really takes cake.Some worst problems : Napoleon ( like historic person , 'm hurt fanboy ) n't age nearly old last scenes , let alone early .

Napoleon,"As ""Napoleon"" (2023 release from the UK; 157 min) opens, it is ""France, 1793"" and Marie-Antoinette is meeting her final fate: beheaded as Napoleon watches from the crowd. We then go to Toulon, where Napoleon takes on the French royalists who are aided by British troops... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest oeuvre, don't just call it a film, from director Ridley Scott, who is now a crisp 86 years young if you can believe it. Here he decides to go yet bigger and bolder than ever before, and resistance will be futile. Except there is one little problem: the story telling simply lacks in quality and history (Napoleon did not watch Marie-Antoinette's beheading, for starters). We literally have no idea where Napoleon comes from or how he ends up being in the position that he was in at that perilous time. The same is true as the movie chugs along. I can honestly say that I know exactly the same of Napoleon before and after seeing the movie. As for the battle scenes, yes they are stage impressively, no doubt about that. But that is not enough to save this movie. Joaquin Phoenix seems strangely miscast as Napoleon. Bottom line: this is a Napoleon biopic with the subtlety of a bull in a China shop, and not all that enjoyable or even memorable.""Napoleon"" was released in theaters a few weeks back, to so-so critical and commercial acclaim. I finally saw this a few days ago. Given the enormous hype around this film, my expectations were fairly high, and I regret to say that they were not met, not even close.

Napoleon,"When you go to a movie about Napoleon, titled ""Napoleon"", you have certain expectations. You expect to see Napoleon, some battles and some historical events and explanation. Napoleon barely delivers such things. It is a very strange movie that makes some undeniably bad choices in terms of what it chooses to focus on. Most of the story is centered not around Napoleon, but around Josephine. She is his wife and muse and he simps hard for her. Almost everything in the movie is bent to fit around her in some way and it turns what should have been a little sideplot into the main focus of almost every single thing in this movie. It makes this 200 million dollar movie feel like a cheap romantic B-film.The battle scenes are few and far between. There's three in total and two of them are over fairly quickly. It's a shame because they're pretty decent. Waterloo takes a little longer but lacks the massive scale I was hoping to see. If you say there's 125.000 men, show me the 125.000 men. At times it felt like there were no more than 125. It really makes you wonder where all that money went.The plot in Napoleon is disjointed, rushed and all over the place. It spends way too much time showing Phoenix having dull PG-13 sex with Josephine but totally skips important events that actually matter to the story. I know there's a four hour cut and I'm sure that'll be at least somewhat better, but the way they chose to cut this one is ridiculous. It is almost three hours long and still manages to tell basically nothing about Napoleon's life, his character, his rise to power, his battle tactics and/or his fall from grace. All it tells is that he liked Josephine and France.Phoenix does okay but feels like he's trying a bit too hard to be quirky, almost Jack Sparrow-ish at times. The weird way he interacts with Josephine is offputting and he lacks any power and charisma in almost every scene. It makes it hard to believe that entire armies look up to him and would desert for him. It's not that Phoenix does bad, it's just that his type of acting doesn't feel right for the role of a powerful dictator. The rest of the cast does okay but there are no noteworthy performances. This movie might have been forced into cinemas for the oscars, but I highly doubt it'll get any.I'm not a history buff and I'll fully admit that any historical inaccuracies have certainly not bothered me. It's usually not too blatant. And it's not what made the movie bad to me. If you áre into history, my wife has assured me you'll likely notice another full layer of awfulness that most people might miss out on. Good luck.All in all, Napoleon is just a chore of a movie to get through. It has it's occassional moments, but they make up at most thirty minutes of it's runtime. The rest of it is either dull, confusing, bad or a depressing mix of all three.","go movie Napoleon , titled `` Napoleon '' , certain expectations . expect see Napoleon , battles historical events explanation .

Napoleon,"This film is both. Paul Barras, in reality a genuine rival and enemy of Napoleon and one of Napoleon's fiercest opponents within France during his rise to power (while being romantically involved with Josephine prior to her involvement with Napoleon), is almost never shown as such, while the lengthy maneuvering to get his plan for the recapture of Toulon approved, which required alliance with powerful officials separate from Barras, is never shown. Napoleon's early campaign in Italy, where he faced three powerful Austrian armies, defeated them all after ferocious fighting, and in so doing really did save Revolutionary France from destruction, is never depicted. The Battle of Marengo, when Napoleon genuinely lost a battle and only had it regained due to the timely intervention of his lieutenant Louis Desaix, killed in the battle, is never depicted. His ordering of the arrest and execution of the Duc d'Enghien, the French royal heir - one of the most-momentous decisions in Napoleon's entire career - is never depicted. These are only the most-egregious errors in this muddled morass. The battles that are depicted are portrayed without any perception of the strategic maneuvering and adaptation that preceded and defined the battles themselves. In rushing to cover the entirety of Napoleon's career in a mere feature length, the film descends into a muddled non-entity of noise, blood, and confusion. Joaquin Phoenix's atrocious performance is completely at variance with the real man Napoleon was. Rupert Everett as the Duke of Wellington delivers the only competent performance in the entire film - and that in a supporting role.","film .

Wish,"People must be desperate to WISH for a good movie from Disney these days. It isn't here. Extremely shallow plot and story and truly cringe songwriting. The writers couldn't even bother to make anything rhyme when shoehorning in their messaging. Nothing to do with the actors, color and what not (don't even start), and all to do with poor writing. It's like Disney put a gun to someone's head and demanded a movie be created based on the ""When you wish upon a star"" Disney theme. If we find out in the news later that that someone likely will be found dead on the floor and that the script was actually AI-generated, I wouldn't be surprised at all. Disney is reaching new lows. Truly.As mentioned by many others, the plot is crazy thin, there is no inner struggle, no mistakes made, no heroes journey, no villain having any sort of depth. On the last note, they actually teased the villain having some sort of back story and justification, but almost as soon as they introduced some of his history and fears, it was swept away reminiscent to a proverbial rug pull straight into shallow villainy. How awesome would it have been if we could be somewhat torn and sympathetic to the idea that some wishes actually can be damaging to others/dangerous, as the movie insinuates for maybe 5 seconds before casting aside? Wow this could have been a decent story, but Disney chose to walk on eggshells. They can't please anyone these days so we must all be triple wrapped in cellophane and styrofoam and forced to watch a ""safe"" movie. They truly lost their touch. It's unfortunate (just in this one instance :D) that my kids really wanted to see this movie so I indulged them. Shame on them!

Wish,"The movie begins with about twelve minutes of straight exposition about the magical kingdom the heroine lives in and its benevolent magical king, and how when you're 18, the King takes your dream from you and then randomly grants subjects those wishes, which they've forgotten. This put me on guard. Children's movies should start out simply: there's a baby deer born in the forest, or an ogre everyone wishes to kill. If the story teller wishes to elaborate, or play with our assumptions, that's all part of the game, and even small children recognize these tropes, like the five-year-old daughter of friends. We were at a performance of TTWELFTH NIGHT, and when Beatrice and Benedict start arguing, she turned to her parents and asked ""They fall in love, don't they?""Kids understand these things, despite the confusion of people who think that Elmer Fudd trying to shoot Bugs Bunny would cause me to shoot my brother. I understood the difference between a cartoon rabbit and my brother, and we fought constantly, which my parents understood. This is why we had no fire arms in the house, and knives were kept out of our reach.I seem to digress, but I do not. On discovering that the King has no intention of granting her aged grandfather's wish because it is too vague and might easily be dangerous, she immediately concludes the King is Evil, and wishes on a star, which comes down and grants wishes totally at random. Animals -- particularly her pet goat -- and flowers speak. The King asks his loyal subjects for helping finding out who did this. They ask for a little clarity, so he goes to his library, opens some Evil Magical Books, and, well, you know how this will turn out.WISH is probably the most lazily written children's fairy tale I have encountered in the movies. The jokes are variations on other Disney cartoon features, the songs are all strident anthems about the characters' feelings, and all the male characters are evil, ancient, or emotionally compromised and hence useless. Is it necessary to make men the villains in the name of Feminine Empowerment? Is all male authority corrupt, while women are always kind and helpful?No. I think Disney is simply telling the story they believe their audience wishes to hear. I have no doubt that the parents and guardians of many small children think things like this are what their children should hear, but it is neither the story I wanted to hear when I was a child, nor did it teach me anything useful: that the world is a dangerous place, and you need to be wary, but help can come from unexpected directions, and it's not a miracle or magic. It's just people.","movie begins twelve minutes straight exposition magical kingdom heroine lives benevolent magical king , 're 18 , King takes dream randomly grants subjects wishes , 've forgotten . put guard .

Wish,"I went into the theater completely unmoved by any trailer or marketing made in effort to promote this movie. I had no preconceptions-- no real expectations.

Wish,"I want to preface this by saying I'm not a hater - I love Disney. I'm a Disney Renaissance kid, so the magic of these films are near and dear to my heart. But bad writing is bad writing.As soon as Asha opened her mouth I disliked - I'm tired of these copy-paste Disney heroines. When Rapunzel was the first quirky Disney heroine in 2010, it was amazing! It was new and exciting to see a Disney princess/female protagonist who wasn't perfect, but eccentric, clumsy, and awkward. But the same trick gets old when you see it over and over again. Asha had absolutely no distinctive characteristics, nothing about her was unique or even interesting. But Asha wasn't the only character in this film who I wish were different.Her sidekick goat, Valentino, had no distinctive personality either. He was no nagging yet caring Sebastian, he was no mischievous yet reliable Abu, he wasn't anything. If you asked me to describe Valentino with a word, I couldn't. I would just say, ""he was there."" Nobody in the theater I was in laughed at any of his lines. His comic relief was barely a relief. I think Star, WHO HAD NO LINES, was a stronger character than the goat. And that's not because Star was an integral part of the plot - it's because Star had a cohesive character design. Star was whimsical, silly, caring, energetic, etc. Valentino was certainly not the GOAT of goats.The villain, Magnifico, was evil throughout the film, he got more evil as it progressed. He's deeply narcissistic, and he even has a song where he gaslights the people of Rosas, ""this is the thanks I get?"" But again, he just didn't feel unique or distinctive to me as a villain. What bothers me even more about Magnifico, though, is that I felt there was an enormous missed writing opportunity.In the very beginning of the film, he briefly mentions this burnt tapestry and was like, oh this tragic thing happened to me, it's (supposedly?) an integral part of my character - AND THEN IT WAS NEVER DEVELOPED! ""Hey, our villain has this tragic backstory, there's a burnt tapestry on the wall about it!"" Okay and? So what happens? Will there be a flashback? Will his trauma somehow be healed throughout the story and he'll return everyone's wishes, or grant everyone's wishes? Why mention the tapestry of trauma at all if it doesn't help develop the plot or complete a character arc? Imagine how emotional it could've been if towards the end of the film, with TEARS IN HIS EYES and REMORSE, he talks about how he just wanted to protect the people and their wishes. If the writers just wanted him to come in and go out as a villain (Gaston, Clayton, Maleficient) that's fine, it's fine. But then why bring up the tapestry of trauma? Beginning of the film: this is a complicated and dynamic villain/ Ending of the film: psych.I also found the ""forest/star song"" to be another missed opportunity. I understand in musical productions like Disney films and Broadway, the songs are plot devices. They can give us information, they can move the story along. But I felt that the forest song's message - ""we're all stars"" - didn't come across very well. I was so surprised by mushrooms and forest critters ""coming to life"" that I couldn't even tune into to the lyrics of the song. The message of the song - we're all stars - NEEDS to be communicated to the audience because it's how the conflict of the story is resolved.The people harness the star power within themselves to take back their wishes and kingdom. But I just felt this information could've been more effectively communicated as dialogue, ""our kingdom has this old legend..."" or, ""my father once told me...."" Like how about the FATHER tells Asha about this star power in a sentimental FLASHBACK? It's hard to hear the very important information being told to us if there's a million distracting things happening! Be Our Guest could have a million billion beautiful things simultaneously happening on the screen because the song isn't communicating any important information, it's okay that it was a spectacle, same with Under the Sea. But the forest/star song tells the audience how the conflict will be resolved. And if you miss that, then when it happens at the end of the story, it feels very unexpected...sudden, random.I also hate to say this, but I didn't love the traditional 2D with the 3D. I just felt that it didn't look good. I know other recent films or television shows have used the two mediums together successfully and seamlessly, but in Wish, it just never looked good.The queen turning against her evil king-husband also could've been developed better. What was her motive for turning against him? She saw he turned evil and she just...had enough? Okay, but was she conflicted about turning against him? Was it hard for her to do it? Just feels like another missed writing opportunity and another weak, unremarkable character.The songs were mostly unmemorable.The baggy-eyed friend who betrayed Asha shouldn't have come back at the end and asked for forgiveness either - and then to BE forgiven?! What does that teach children? Be forgiving - even to people who literally BETRAY YOU by turning you in to a psychotic, evil king who will do gosh-only-knows what to you?! He should've been left in the forest with the rabbits!I appreciate the film's fundamental message - make your own wishes come true, don't depend on someone else to make your wishes come true, and even...reclaim your individual power and then collectively overthrow tyrannical rulers - I'm so down with all of that, it's a fantastic premise for a story. But the execution of it, the story telling? It left me wishing for much more.","want preface saying 'm hater - love Disney .

It had too many loose ends, too many songs, which weren't even good to begin with, and it was too predictable and eye rolling. The characters weren't that inspiring either.

Wish,"This movie was alright but Disney holds themselves to high expectations, so I expected more. Movie had a quick pace so it was hard to really be invested in the issues or characters. At times the other references to Disney felt like the movie was trying too hard. Songs were somewhat catchy but compared to movies like Frozen, Moana and others this just doesn't stack up. There was also no twist or turns and everything was pretty predictable and obvious. I will say the villain was not someone who was just misunderstood, he was truly taking a key piece of people for selfish gain and I hated him immediately, so they have that going for them.","movie alright Disney holds high expectations , expected .

Wish,"As stated in the title, the songs were pretty good and enjoyable, but ultimately felt entirely out of place and did nothing to move the plot forward. There's literally a scene in the movie where they sing about the fact that they need to expose the evil ruler, but during the song they are doing nothing but dancing around and waving objects through the air. We don't see any plans being made or objects being constructed, nothing to show they were actually doing anything to reach their goal. Ultimately, it felt pointless.It's disappointing to see such a lack of creativity out of Disney. The idea for the plot was fine, but it feels like it lacked proper writing to make the story interesting. The King was exposed as the bad guy in the first 10 minutes. No build-up or any anticipation at all.

Wish,"Disney's 100th celebration falls flat with ""Wish,"" a film that struggles to maintain its own identity in the beloved Disney animated canon.Unfortunately the problem with the film is the story is so underdeveloped and poorly executed. There are no stakes and the end result is a muddled theme, uneven pacing, and boring, flat characters. The film attempts to pay homage to older Disney classics and all the ingredients are there: lovable characters, a menacing, tongue-in cheek villain, cute animal sidekicks, and interesting concepts; but instead of ""showing"" the character beats like older films, we are ""told"" the story through bland dialogue and little action. Asha joins Disney's recent line of uninspiring ""adorkable"" female protagonists, with no defining motivations or character growth. This quirky, clumsy character archetype for Disney princesses has been recycled for the past decade with Rapunzel, Anna, Moana, and Mirabel. The animation and sound don't fair better, with bland, pop-y music that feels like filler and a combination of animation styles that look unpolished. There is no ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Part of your World,"" ""Let it Go"" or ""We Don't Talk about Bruno"".It's laughable that one of the lyrics to the song ""I'm a Star"" in the movie is ""in this universe we are all shareholders."" Wish remains harmless entertainment for families but is a painful reminder of what this film sets out to do: please investors. This film is a rushed, soulless, by the numbers paint-job with no innovation in storytelling or animation. A massive disappointment to Disney's legacy and a poor excuse for their 100th animated film.","Disney 's 100th celebration falls flat `` Wish , '' film struggles maintain identity beloved Disney animated canon.Unfortunately problem film story underdeveloped poorly executed . stakes end result muddled theme , uneven pacing , boring , flat characters . film attempts pay homage older Disney classics ingredients : lovable characters , menacing , tongue-in cheek villain , cute animal sidekicks , interesting concepts ; instead `` showing '' character beats like older films , `` told '' story bland dialogue little action .

Wonka,"The new Wonka movie presents a visually stunning spectacle, yet falls short in narrative depth. The music, although well-composed, feels out of sync with Wonka's mouth, contributing to the film's superficialaity. The antagonists, while present, miss a sense of genuine malice, leaving one questioning their impact. This lack of depth permeates the movie, challenging its believability despite its fictional roots.References to the original film come across as forced, failing to capture the original's charm. The plot hinges on chance, an element that feels both central and contrived, further distancing the film from a sense of realism. Characters, except for a few, lack realism.Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka, while competent, doesn't fully embrace the eccentricity of Dahl's vision, feeling somewhat restrained.

Wonka,"My wife and I caught Wonka (The 2023) in theaters last night. The storyline traces Wonka's lifelong journey to perfect the art of chocolate-making, inspired by his long-lost mother. With dreams of opening his own shop, Wonka faces financial constraints and navigates a world of labor and manipulation. The question remains: can he forge new friendships and still achieve his goals?Directed by Paul King (Paddington), the film stars Timothée Chalamet (Dune), Olivia Colman (The Lobster), Calah Lane (The Day Shall Come), Keegan-Michael Key (The Predator), and Rowan Atkinson (Bean).This movie proves to be a frustrating and uneven experience, lacking a cohesive element throughout. The dialogue feels inauthentic, the songs fail to captivate, and the overall storyline, while okay, leaves something to be desired. Although there are worthwhile subplots, such as the mom backstory, there are also misses like the Noodle character that doesn't quite land. Despite standout performances from Hugh Grant and the sweatshop owners, the feel still falls flat. The villains, settings, and attire are commendable, but Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka leaves something to be desired-missing the eerie and slightly scary essence the character demands.In conclusion, Wonka stands out as a significant disappointment for 2023.

Maestro,"Came in knowing nothing about the guy, and even after 2 hours I can't say that changed. A common critique of biopics is how their structure usually facilitates merely the broad lines, the Wikipedia summary. Well, let me tell you, Bernstein's Wikipedia page is infinitely more interesting than anything this shows on screen. I mean, the guy had an FBI file due to his left-wing activism, and even Sherlock couldn't deduce that out of this film. Granted, Cooper seems more drawn to interiority, to psyche, but his insistence on bulldozering through the story leaves emotional connections severed. So much nuance is lost that when Bernstein has a fight with his wife, the performances mighty as can be, the motivations behind their disagreement were absent to me. Cooper doesn't seem able to decide how the hell he wants to approach this man. Is it about a troubled mind, an artist wrestling with the inevitably of his end? Is it about a marital struggle fueled by sexuality and ego? Is it about Bernstein's connection to the realm of music? It's all of this and ends up none of this, each element so criminally undercooked it's ultimately unfocused.Maybe the biggest offense, though, is how little we see him actually conduct. It takes 90 minutes for the film to properly show us the conductor doing what that name entails, and it's powerful, not only musically but also through the energy and dedication displayed by Cooper. Obviously, 2 hours of this is not what I'm asking for - but it does hint at the underlying problem of Cooper not understanding where the strengths in this tale lie. Incredible how last year's Tár boasts a completely fictional character that feels more real and defined than the recreation of an actual person here.At the end of the day, it looks neat and features some marvelous performances that will probably sneak their way into the awards season, but, ultimately, there doesn't appear to be a point, which dooms both your engagement and remembrance: I watched this mere hours ago and forgot about it multiple times already.","Came knowing nothing guy , even 2 hours ca n't say changed . common critique biopics structure usually facilitates merely broad lines , Wikipedia summary .

Maestro,"Once I got over the disappointment that this film is not about composing or even conducting, but about an extremely unlikeable man and his wife, I was more disappointed by the fact that this couple is dreadful, and they have zero chemistry together. Maybe that's the point. Their marriage seems to be an act that they play out together, because Bernstein is too much of a coward to live openly as a gay man. They don't feel like real people with real emotions. Bernstein in a letter wrote once that he was in an imaginary marriage, and it's painful to watch at times. He comes across as a selfish bore of a man. He doesn't seem like a man capable of composing music at all. His soul seems dark and his heart empty.So, I have to wonder why Cooper made this film at all other than for the hope of winning an Oscar for best actor.

It was a dull unemotional Marriage Story where people keep talking and talking about the most mundane aspects of life.

Maestro,"And another music-themed Bradley Cooper movie that I really wanted to like, but ended up hating, and for similar reasons. At least I managed to watch ""Maestro"" through to the end, but only made it a third of the way through ""A Star is Born"".Perhaps the movie's most egregious failure is obsessing about Bernstein's bisexuality, promiscuity and attendant family dysfunction rather than focusing on his singular place in the pantheon of American musicians.I think it is the second or third scene where the ""Lenny's Gay!"" theme is introduced (awkwardly, involving a foot massage...), and it never lets up from there. For a movie titled ""Maestro"", and for anyone with the slightest awareness of Bernstein's enormous mid-century stature and popularity, it's shocking that only a handful of scenes even attempt to illustrate his musical genius... and do so poorly.My other major source of agita was the abysmally stilted dialogue. There is not a single line of dialogue that rings true, is profound or memorable, or advances a deeper understanding of any of the characters. In the words of a memorable Seinfeld episode, ""It's all just so much fluff"". Charitably, it may have been a ""style over substance"" artistic decision, intended to evoke the badinage one might hear at a chic Manhattan cocktail party, or the rapid-fire repartee in mid-century films and stage plays, but it simply comes across as pointless and contrived. And, in an effort to sound ""authentic"", most scenes involve two or more characters speaking over each other. I normally hate Netflix captions, but felt compelled to turn them on to ""de-muddle"" the dialog.Much has been made about the set design, period costumes and cinematography, which are all indeed first-rate, but these are marred and jarred by strange camera angles, framing and editing choices. It doesn't quite enter pretentious student film territory, but comes perilously close, and to say the film has ""pacing problems"" is an understatement.Finally, a two-hour movie about Bernstein and his music should have a phenomenal soundtrack, and musical cues that help advance the plot. Instead, the music direction is plagued by the same weak and amateurish production as the rest of the film.","another music-themed Bradley Cooper movie really wanted like , ended hating , similar reasons . least managed watch `` Maestro '' end , made third way `` Star Born '' .Perhaps movie 's egregious failure obsessing Bernstein 's bisexuality , promiscuity attendant family dysfunction rather focusing singular place pantheon American musicians.I think second third scene `` Lenny 's Gay !

It doesn't quite enter pretentious student film territory, but comes perilously close, and to say the film has ""pacing problems"" is an understatement.Finally, a two-hour movie about Bernstein and his music should have a phenomenal soundtrack, and musical cues that help advance the plot.

The entire production revolved around Cooper trying to convince us he's a genius with his fake nose trying to look more Jewish. He doesn't care how boring this film is, he thinks it's what the academy wants. Maybe he's right but this is Fosse and Vernon without the chemistry.

Maestro,"A horrible movie that did not deliver on what it seems to portray. To portray a historical figure is a hard task to do but to simply just imitate without caring the wholistic aspect of the spectator's experience is a bit unappealing. This really diverted from what I know Bradley Cooper as on screen. The lack of depth of the other characters really made it a fleeting movie that has no real gravitas towards any scene. Everything does not seem to be connected coherently that the audience were scrambling for what really is happening. Thank god it's only 2 hours although it's 2 hours I will never get back.

Maestro,"Bradley Cooper rarely misses as both a director and actor, but in Maestro he missed the mark on both. This movie was unbelievably dull, with a hard to follow and confusing plot and mediocre acting. Carey Mulligan is fine (though not her best role as compared to other gems she has been in) but there is just no chemistry between her and Cooper. He is simply not good in this role. It's just plain bad and it seems like he's just doing a lackluster impersonation of Bernstein instead of really turning himself the character. I had to fast forward at times and the whole time, I wanted to watch A Star is Born again as it's so superior in every way and reminds me why I love Cooper so much as a director and actor.

Maestro,"Excellent performances, especially from Carey Mulligan, as is expected. Other than that it's incredibly boring. That world is one I'm not the slightest bit interested in and watching the film hasn't changed my mind.I'm almost certainly wrong about this but I think a conductor does very little. The musicians in front of him or her barely look up so what is the point in waving your arms around so dramatically? I know that Bernstein wasn't merely a conductor. I bring up my conductor point because of the big deal that was made out of Bradley Cooper conducting that orchestra.

Maestro,"My expectations were much too high, I guess.

Everything feels rushed and superficial, and the running time of more than two hours felt too short in the end.

Maestro,Bradley does a convincing facial transformation with make up and nose piece to look enough like Bernstein. Unfortunately every other aspect of the movie is lacking. First of all didn't like the direction. Strange camera angles. Unnecessary black and white cinematography. Also the mumbling dialogue and affected way the leads spoke. I know they were artists but no one talks like that. The main problem was the screenplay turned out like most biopics focussed on the wrong things. It does show him conducting but does not show him creating and glosses over his most famous work West Side Story. Instead the focus is on his marriage. Carey Mulligan is good at looking sad as usual. Sure she wasn't happy in the end he was having affairs with men but is this movie supposed to be about Leonard Bernstein's marriage? Not interesting aspect of his life. In this way it was even worse than the Cole Porter biopic with Kevin Kline. Too much about the relationship problems. In a biopic it's better to do it the old fashioned Hollywood way like in the 50s and 60s. Don't concentrate on the love life and focus on the man and his achievements and his legacy. But that's the problem with modern biopics. Too bad this could not have been an exception.

Maestro,"I had hoped to enjoy 'Maestro'. It is a film for adult audiences, featuring actors I appreciate (Bradley Cooper and Carey Mulligan) and directed by that same Bradley Cooper. It deals with a true American Icon (composer / conductor Leonard Bernstein) and deals with the 'man' inside that icon. In this time of Holiday Blockbusters it promised to appeal to an audience like me. And, in fact, it did. The theatre was two-thirds full; a first-time-since-the-Pandemic at this small art house.The film, however, is something of a mess. It is confused about the type of picture it wants to be. In its first thirty minutes it takes on a flight-of-fancy aura; it is as though Bernstein and his soon to be wife are in a musical-comedy with the background stage settings changing as if by magic. The film's first half is in black and white; I imagine a testament to The Forties and early Fifties (the time period covered by those scenes) but, in fact, lots of color-films were made at that time.Leonard Bernstein was bisexual. And that bisexuality is, in fact, revealed, but revealed in a coy, teasing, easy-to-misunderstand way. And then there is the background music, all of which was composed by Bernstein, but not all of which fits the scene it backgrounds. The selection from his 'West Side Story' is the most emblematic of this. But not the only example.For me, the story belongs to Bernstein's wife Felicia (played by Mulligan). She is the wife of a bisexual man; a fact that is problematic enough. But he is a man who is always center-stage, and for whom she gave up a promising career to raise their children, support her husband, and who suffers in silence until she can suffer silently no longer. But even here (and though Mulligan has long been a favorite of mine), there is a smile on her character that (a) rings insincere and (b) is repeated so often that I wanted to scream, No more. But, sadly, there is more; the most cinematic, most hard-to-believe smile coming, in a hard-to believe scene, in London's Westminster Cathedral.Finally there is the finale. I will give nothing away when I say that the film ends one scene too late, it is one scene too long. A scene in which Bernstein instructs a young orchestra conductor would be as appropriate an ending as one could hope for.But then .....","hoped enjoy 'Maestro ' . film adult audiences , featuring actors appreciate ( Bradley Cooper Carey Mulligan ) directed Bradley Cooper . deals true American Icon ( composer / conductor Leonard Bernstein ) deals 'man ' inside icon . time Holiday Blockbusters promised appeal audience like . , fact , . theatre two-thirds full ; first-time-since-the-Pandemic small art house.The film , however , something mess . confused type picture wants . first thirty minutes takes flight-of-fancy aura ; though Bernstein soon wife musical-comedy background stage settings changing magic . film 's first half black white ; imagine testament Forties early Fifties ( time period covered scenes ) , fact , lots color-films made time.Leonard Bernstein bisexual . bisexuality , fact , revealed , revealed coy , teasing , easy-to-misunderstand way . background music , composed Bernstein , fits scene backgrounds . selection 'West Side Story ' emblematic . example.For , story belongs Bernstein 's wife Felicia ( played Mulligan ) . wife bisexual man ; fact problematic enough . man always center-stage , gave promising career raise children , support husband , suffers silence suffer silently longer . even ( though Mulligan long favorite mine ) , smile character ( ) rings insincere ( b ) repeated often wanted scream , . , sadly , ; cinematic , hard-to-believe smile coming , hard-to believe scene , London 's Westminster Cathedral.Finally finale . give nothing away say film ends one scene late , one scene long . scene Bernstein instructs young orchestra conductor would appropriate ending one could hope for.But ... ..","hope enjoy 'maestro ' . film adult audienc , featur actor appreci ( bradley cooper carey mulligan ) direct bradley cooper . deal true american icon ( compos / conductor leonard bernstein ) deal 'man ' insid icon . time holiday blockbust promis appeal audienc like . , fact , . theatr two-third full ; first-time-since-the-pandem small art house.th film , howev , someth mess . confus type pictur want . first thirti minut take flight-of-f aura ; though bernstein soon wife musical-comedi background stage set chang magic . film 's first half black white ; imagin testament forti earli fifti ( time period cover scene ) , fact , lot color-film made time.leonard bernstein bisexu . bisexu , fact , reveal , reveal coy , teas , easy-to-misunderstand way . background music , compos bernstein , fit scene background . select 'west side stori ' emblemat . example.for , stori belong bernstein 's wife felicia ( play mulligan ) . wife bisexu man ; fact problemat enough . man alway center-stag , gave promis career rais children , support husband , suffer silenc suffer silent longer . even ( though mulligan long favorit mine ) , smile charact ( ) ring insincer ( b ) repeat often want scream , . , sadli , ; cinemat , hard-to-believ smile come , hard-to believ scene , london 's westminst cathedral.fin final . give noth away say film end one scene late , one scene long . scene bernstein instruct young orchestra conductor would appropri end one could hope for.but ... ..",bad,negative,-0.4797
Maestro,"Once upon a time there was a nice Jewish boy named Leonard Bernstein who lived in the artists apartments in Carnegie Hall. One day a conductor couldn't show up at Carnegie Hall, so Leonard took his place, and everyone called him a genius. He married beautiful Carey Mulligan and had beautiful children and made important music and TV shows and money. And because he was bisexual, he cheated on his wife with anyone he wanted. Once his wife got angry with him and left, but she came back. Then his wife got cancer and died, and Leonard was sad, but now he could sleep with anyone. And if he hasn't died, he's still doing that today.Well, he did die in 1990 at the age of 72, and Bradley Cooper wore a big fake nose to play him in this movie. That got a lot of people very angry, but I thought it made him look like Bernstein. Mostly, though, I wonder why Bernstein for this diagetic musical? Why not someone who did more interesting music, like Aaron Copeland? As I am so often, these days, I am confronted with the question of who this movie was made for.Not that it's not a fine piece of film making, with great performances, but it's not really much of a story, is it? As for Bernstein's music, he was a middling talent as a composer, and never appreciated the good work he did there; as a conductor, he was mainly notable for being one of the first Americans to be the conductor of a major orchestra or three. His most important role was probably that of educator, not only for his Young People's Concerts, training other conductors, and keeping the upper edge of cultural consensus going in this country for longer than it might have otherwise. Is that enough to justify a motion picture, even one that Spielberg and Scorsese expressed interest in directing?","upon time nice Jewish boy named Leonard Bernstein lived artists apartments Carnegie Hall .

Maestro,"I'm a classical music fan and a Leonard Bernstein fan. I have several recordings of Lenny's in my collection. There are not many great films that have the classical music world or figures as their subject. So I was looking forward to this film with great anticipation.I can't think of any other film that was so well done in so many areas of film form, that has bored me to the point of trauma as Maestro has. It looks great. Its sounds great. The direction, cinematography, editing, mise en scene, and the acting are all superb. The hair, makeup and costumes are flawless. The depiction of the various historical periods are excellent. But the characters, story and dialogue are so empty, so banal, so inconsequential that the film's positive aspects are utterly canceled and undermined.Not one interesting word or sentence is uttered in the entire movie. Bernstein, an outstanding conductor and composer and his wife also a seemingly outstanding person and artist are empty shells with nothing to say. No one in the entire picture says anything interesting. It's unbelievable that any people let alone these, who revolve at the highest levels of music, artistry and society could not utter a single relevant word of any interest. If Lenny and his wife were like this at all, it could only represent a fraction of who they were. Two minutes of listening to the real Lenny in his Young Person's TV show gives us a far more compelling amount of talk and revelation of personality than this entire film.I did not learn one thing about Lenny or his wife in this movie that I did not read in a synopsis before going to see the flick at the cinema. Its impossible that these people could be so vacant in reality. Even when Lenny is giving his views on art and life to a biographer who is recording an interview with him in one scene, his statements are mundane and trite. There are a couple of party scenes in the picture where one would think that you would hear some interesting if not compelling conversations. Not here. Not one word of any interest is said in these scenes.There is no drama, no conflict, no tension and no emotion anywhere in this film. It is all style and no substance whatsoever. Despite its polished surface and attention to historical period detail the narrative is inert and the characters sterile in depiction. I'm still trying to find a way to articulate
the effect this film had on me. Right now I only know that overall, its was an abrasive and grating experience.The film left me cold and angry. The boredom of it was almost traumatizing as I tried so hard to find something of interest in it. I was in disbelief, exhausted and baffled as I left the cinema trying to understand what I had just sat through. Disappointment is to weak of a word to describe my feelings toward this film. The experience was painfully boring. Perhaps the most intense, active and sustained boredom Ive ever been through. So I harbour great antipathy toward this flick. Its memorable to me for the severity of its boredom and the depth of its vacancy. I'm a film lover and I utterly hate this film!Nothing of music or of Bernstein exists in this picture. Just a shiny well made image of a man and woman that is completely empty of meaning, emotion or thought. Unfortunately, this film might reinforce the idea that some people have of Classical music as being boring. Don't believe it.

Regret for having paid to see it in cinemas. Regret for having expected a storyline. Regret for having wasted my Saturday evening.There is no plot of any substance. Nothing propelling the viewer through the film. Not once did I find myself wondering, 'Ooh, what's going to happen next?'Some of it looks pretty. And the all star cast is visually appealing but ultimately wasted (I felt no emotional connection with any of them).It's just a bunch of scenes stuck together. If there is a theme or lesson to be taken from the film, you have to drag it's body out, lifeless and limp, from underneath the mess of monotonous and rambling dialogue.I'm sure that Wes Anderson super fans will think it was all very clever. (That's fine - I've enjoyed some of his films in the past.)But as an average movie goer, I think that Asteroid City was a total w*nk fest.If I had been watching this at home, I would have turned it off after 20 minutes.

Asteroid_City,"Asteroid CitySome of the other reviews on here are quite bizarre in their conclusions. It is self-evident this big budget art house movie lacks most of the key components of any dramatic production. Plot, narrative impetus, compression of reality, and an arch like structure with empathetic characters.It had all the depth of a detergent advert but without the purpose, any sane watcher in the picture house would have walked out about 10 minutes in.Over stylised without a plot, shallow characters and a bizarre wordy script purporting to be a comedy, the minimum bar for a comedy being six out loud laughs per movie, I didn't laugh once! This is perhaps Wes Anderson's weakest movie thus far, perhaps he should give up as he appears to have lost the plot!Overall, I'm giving this 1 outta 10.

Asteroid_City,"Writer-director Wes Anderson has lost his way, and this film proves it. I realize that the auteur's signature style of filmmaking is an acquired taste, and, to his credit, he's made some fine pictures over the years. But this one is not among them. In fact, contrary to many of the inexplicable claims that this is his finest release, I'd contend just the opposite. It's arguably his worst, a meandering, cryptic, unfocused piece that's so muddled you'll need the assistance of a search party to find your way out of it (that is, if you even care by the time the end of this overlong mess rolls around). The director appears to have become so enamored with his own eccentricity that it doesn't even seem to matter to him whether or not viewers are on the same page as he is. Admittedly, this offering once again captures Anderson's singularly stylish look with a stunning production design and gorgeous cinematography. But that's all it has going for it, and that's unfortunate given the phenomenal cast he has available to him. What's more, despite his proficiency in creating superb visual style, he's forgotten about pairing it with meaningful (or even interesting) substance. Its incomprehensibility and inclusion of bits that are there just for the sake of their own whimsy seriously undercut any effort to make this an intelligible work. In short, ""Asteroid City"" is yet another major disappointment in what is turning out to be a dreadfully dismal summer movie season. It's likely to appeal only to diehard fans of the director (and maybe not even a lot of them this time out). If you're on the fence about this one, consider the following two telling tipoffs: (1) when no one in the theater is laughing at what's been billed as a comedy, that should speak volumes about it (as happened at the screening I attended); and (2) when you consider how aggressively and ubiquitously the distributors have been promoting this film in ads on TV and the internet, it's obvious they're trying awfully hard to peddle shabby, substandard merchandise.

Asteroid_City,"As the end-credit song reminds us, ""You can't wake up if you don't fall asleep."" Wes Anderson's extravagant confection enacts the variety of dream-lives that buffer - yet illuminate - our ""real"" life.The film is a nesting doll of performed fictions. The film we've gone to a theatre to see - so far - opens on a small-screen black and white TV image where the host (Brian Cranston) introduces playwright Conrad Earp (Edward Norton) at work. He appears in a small box far away in the small screen. That's two levels already. His surname evokes yet another, the mythopoeic frontier lawman of the everything's OK corral.A fourth is the stage presentation of that ostensible play, which itself moves from the stage to the backstage, inner-level of presentation. Then the three-act play is itself presented as a reel-life performance in the eponymous small desert town near the atom bomb testing site.On that level, the preternatural bright colours and stylized action add yet another context: the animated cartoon. The ""real"" dramatization is heightened into blatant artifice. As if to confirm this context, an actual roadrunner appears briefly in the action and at length in the foreground of the last shot. The ""meep meep"" is implicit.That layering of dramatic production embodies our dependence upon fantasies to guide us, especially in a world more than ever shadowed by the elaboration of that atomic threat. The periodic boom and mushroom clouds leave the citizens shaken but not stirred. As thematic luck would have it, among the trailers preceding this screening was that of the more historic reminder of the birth of the atomic threat, Oppenheim.Against the cataclysmic paranoia of The Bomb, the film craves community spirit. So Montana defends the alien who briefly reclaims the asteroid that gave the set city its name: ""I reckon that alien didn't mean no harm. No, he ain't American. No, he ain't a creature of God's Earth, but he's a creature of somewhere.""
And aren't we all? Indeed all the film's characters are creatures of a somewhere not quite real but an entrance towards it. Actress Midge and widower Zack move from separate boxed frames into a passionate refuge from their respective tragedies. Zack's antagonistic father-in-law learns a lesson in humanity and respect from Zack's young triplet daughters, their mom transported in Tupperware.With all this fictional layering we often miss the identities in the most star-studded cast since Altman's The Player. The likes of Cranston and Norton, Scarlet Johansen, Liev Schreiber, Tom Hanks, slip by virtually unrecognizable. Conversely, Jason Schwartzman appears usually in his bearded role as recently widowed father, then as the clean-chinned actor. This becomes another kind of layering, of the stretch between the real and the fantasy.All these layers of performance draw us through the director's fantasy to remind us of the debt we, the debt that our science, the debt that our governments, owe - to humanity, not to their own advantage.

Perhaps because of some Post Traumatic Stress and general squeamishness, I found the story of Hemorrhoid City somewhat hard to follow. However, I recall that there were many, many acts to this story, which concurs with Reality, as once you have one incident with Big H, such unpleasantness tends to recur again and again. At any rate, it seems that the Black Widow had a window six inches from that of a vacationing proctor doctor, played by Ash Fox. One afternoon Widow explains her predicament to Ash, who says he'll examine her chassis at no charge. So she steps out of her salt bath in her nativity suit, and Ash lances her obstructed veins through their breezeway.

Asteroid_City,"ASTEROID CITY is a play about a fake news project. At the start of the movie, we are introduced to the actors and their roles. ""The character of Augie Steenbeck in the imaginary tale of our production was to become famously and indelibly connected to the actor who created the role, a former carpenter discovered in a bit part by the play's director, Schubert Green (born Shylock Grzworvszowski)."" The crisis of the play pivots on an alien visitation. The military attempts a lockdown, which is soon circumvented by the kids, who whistle-blow and attract a media circus. Thus we have all the essential roles of fake news: hired actors, the military, and the fake news event. Sometimes it's a pandemic, sometimes it's a riot, sometimes it's an alien, sometimes it's Guadalcanal.All the characters (Augie, Midge, Grandfather, Parents and Stargazers) are professional actors who have actual lives outside the play. Some are bused in for the fake news event, some are pre-placed, like the Mechanic. Twins and triplets are often used in celebrity roles because they can be in more than one place at a time. Hickenlooper represents Consensus Science (""the math doesn't work"") and the General represents the military (giving out awards and seizing inventions, including a DEW). The Playwright, Director and Acting Teacher never enter the play itself. The Host plays the talking head role, not in the play but pushing the narrative. The only people not working for the production are the ordinary folks who are alerted by the media (""everything's already in the newspapers"").Fake news events are scripted and directed by people behind the scenes, like the Playwright, Director and Acting Teacher. Fake news events are role-played by professional actors like Augie and Midge. Fake news events are always guided by media personalities like the Host, who provides us with the information we need to make sense of the staged drama (and utterly failing). With all this professional Crisis Acting, the fake news event itself hardly matters. In the background are the usual fake news events run by the locals (represented by the car chases) and the military-industrial complex (represented by the nukes). The targets of the fake news are the ordinary people who show up for the media circus.While modeling the essential elements of a fake news project for us, the play also takes the opportunity to role-play a sample alien encounter (depicted as partly CGI, partly Jeff Goldblum). The military is on hand, of course, on one pretext or another, and so are the actors. The alien arrives, a professional photographer snaps an iconic photo and then it leaves without a trace. Whistleblowers manage to ignite a media circus in spite of a total military lockdown, and--at the peak of the public furor--the alien mysteriously returns the asteroid, indelibly stamped with alien writing. We have all the elements of a psyop: the ordinary folks, the cover-up, the whistleblower and the undeniable proof.On a metaphorical level, the asteroid represents the moon, specifically the moon landing grift, which has gone so stale that even India is faking it. The asteroid is stored in a little jail cell, which represents the sixty years of transparent fakery that is strangling NASA and all the other space agencies. The alien frees the asteroid, and then returns it, forever stamped it with proof of alien life. A riot is staged by the actors, the lockdown is released, the media circus evaporates, the playwright fakes his death (""Death of a Narcissist"") and the actors bow out. This is how history is made. The final result is a re-characterization of the moon landing and a general loss of faith in God (""I hope you're still Episcopalian"").Why does Augie burn his hand? He doesn't. It was the old ""hot burner"" trick. Midge had a different script than Augie, so she didn't see it coming. Augie and his family, arriving on the scene earlier than the other actors, had their own script they were following. Augie's Crisis Actor family was artificially created with child actors. The mother's role was cut, which naturally confuses the children who are too young to understand, but no one else actually grieves. As photographer, he has special access to Midge, the Playwright and the Director. When Crisis Actors have different scripts, even the actors can get freaked out and provide an authentic performance. Note that his hand being bandaged was part of the script (""They're bandaging the understudy's hand right now."")""You can't wake up if you don't fall asleep"" is a catch-phrase, meant to catch you. It's meaningless until someone invests it with meaning. It starts off controversial (""What?"" ""That's not true."" ""Who cares?"" ""Why should you?"" ""Maybe not."") but with repetition everyone begins to parrot the phrase. Meanwhile the catch-phrase is accompanied by traumatic images which work upon our collective unconscious. The zombies yelling and staggering around mindlessly. The alien carrying the moon towards us. This scene models an MK-Ultra class (""shared experience of a bewildering and bedazzling celestial mystery"") that imparts a narrative through repetition and trauma. In this case, the moon landing spell is being replaced by the alien asteroid spell.","ASTEROID CITY play fake news project . start movie , introduced actors roles . `` character Augie Steenbeck imaginary tale production become famously indelibly connected actor created role , former carpenter discovered bit part play 's director , Schubert Green ( born Shylock Grzworvszowski ) .

Asteroid_City,"First and foremost, this movie boasted an exceptional ensemble cast including Bryan Cranston, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, and Willem Dafoe. It felt like a figment of a writer's imagination. However, the constant dialogue among the cast lacked genuine peril or meaningful connections. Consequently, the film dragged, with nonsensical conversations that failed to coalesce into a coherent plot. The supposed humor in the asteroid city fell flat, and nothing truly captivated my attention, except for the moment when the alien absconded with the asteroid right before everyone's eyes. Anticipating the next turn of events became an exercise in futility since nothing substantial actually occurred.

Saltburn,"Emerald Fennell is a very very posh person. She's from extraordinary wealth. To take nothing away from her achievements as a filmmaker (Promising Young Woman was a terrific, difficult watch and rightly lauded) - but going in knowing that and then coming out the other side of this morally disturbing parable, it's a troubling setting and one that irks me.The two most obvious antagonists are the type of people you'd typically be rooting for in a film about rich vs poor, and the fact it's turned on its head doesn't feel like an innovative step - it feels like the exact opposite.

They become friends.That they become friends is the most believable part of the story.What happens afterwards is a poorly executed ripoff of other movies, but ridiculous in scope, and devoid of reality.

Saltburn,"Saltburn moves along at a good pace, rather stylish and hip as it creates some anticipation for where it may be going. It develops a bit of mystery but we never understand the motivation for the protagonist character. Not much depth for the various character, so can't get invested in them.

Saltburn,"Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh is one of my favorite novels, and I've seen both the 2008 film as well as the 1980s BBC mini-series, so I immediately recognized Saltburn was Brideshead ""updated"" for the 21st century just from seeing the trailers. I waited for it to come on streaming because I was curious but not optimistic. While stylish and peppered with memorable 2000s music for Millennials in the first half of the film, the second half of the film is just gross on purpose. Something about a bathtub drain, I actually had to turn down the volume on my device because I didn't want to hear the nasty slurping sounds of some dork tonguing a dirty plumbing pipe, and it just gets worse not ten minutes later with the clueless virgin Oliver taking advantage of Felix's emotionally unstable sister Venetia hours after a tete-a-tete with her narcissistic mother.Saltburn tries too hard and just ends up playing victim to a sub-generation of people who have mistaken shock value for something intelligent to say. In the original Brideshead Revisited, complex moral questions are visited and there's an emphasis on something other than sex (though it is a racy book for the early 20th century era it was published).

Saltburn,"I'd seen the trailer in the cinema numerous times, it looked interesting, Mark Kermode made it even more intriguing, and being produced, written, and directed by Emerald Fennell (Promising Young Woman) and having some good names in the cast I was definitely up for it. Basically, set in 2006, scholarship student Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) begins attending Oxford University. He struggles to fit in and lacks upper-class sensibilities and the same privileges that many students have from their wealthy parents. He does have conversations with Michael Gavey (Ewan Mitchell) who wants to be his friend, but then Oliver notices affluent and popular student Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). He eventually strikes up a friendship with Felix after helping him when his bicycle wheel has a puncture. Felix invites Oliver to join him and his group of friends for a drink in the pub, leaving Michael who dislikes Felix. Felix is empathetic to Oliver's stories, including his parents having substance abuse problems and mental health issues. Felix makes a consistent effort to include him despite disapproval from his other Oxford friends, including his American cousin Farleigh Start (Gran Turismo's Archie Madekwe). Their friendship grows over the course of the year, but Felix becomes annoyed with Oliver's constant presence, and they have a small spat. One night, Oliver learns that his father has died and shows up distraught at Felix's door. Felix comforts him, and knowing that he has nowhere to go, invites him to spend the summer at his family's large estate, Saltburn. At Saltburn, Oliver is introduced to Felix's parents, Sir James (Richard E. Grant) and Lady Elspeth (Rosamund Pike), and his sister Venetia (Alison Oliver). Also staying at Saltburn are Farleigh and family friend Poor Dear Pamela (Carey Mulligan). Oliver quickly wins over Felix's family, who are sympathetic to his situation and amused by his lack of social graces. Elspeth is fascinated by him as they bond together, and he grows increasingly comfortable at Saltburn. For a few nights, Oliver sees Venetia in a drunken state wandering the grounds. One night, he meets with her in the house garden, and after some conversation performs oral sex on her. Farleigh witnessed this and goads Oliver about telling Felix about it. When confronted by Felix, Oliver lies that it was Venetia who initiated the act, and he immediately cuts her out from the family. Meanwhile, Oliver's obsession with Felix grows stronger. One night, he watches Felix masturbate in the bath, and he drinks the bath water and licks the plug after Felix leaves. Tensions between Oliver and Farleigh reach breaking point when during a karaoke party they have a flirtatious moment, and Farleigh tricks Oliver into performing ""Rent"" by Pet Shop Boys in front of the family. Later that night, Oliver goes into Farleigh's room, gives him a handjob while also threatening him. The next morning, Farleigh is forced to leave Saltburn after it is said that he was trying to steal valuables from the house. Later, while Oliver is with Felix and Elspeth, she casually mentions that Pamela has died, apparently committing suicide. As the summer draws to a close, Elspeth and James plan an elaborate party to celebrate Oliver's birthday. The morning of the party, Felix surprises Oliver after organising to visit his estranged mother Paula (Dorothy Atkinson), answering a call from her on his phone. Oliver resists, but Felix insists that he try to repair their relationship. However, arriving at his mother's house, Oliver's background stories have been fabricated: his father Jeff (Shaun Dooley) is alive, and his parents live in a respectable upper-middle-class suburb. Felix is angered by Oliver's deception and wants him to leave Saltburn after the party. During the extravagant celebrations, Oliver encounters Farleigh, who reminds him that he will always be an outsider to their lifestyle. Hundreds of guests are there to sing ""Happy Birthday to You"" but it is apparent many can't remember Oliver's name. Desperate to reconcile with Felix, Oliver follows him into Saltburn's large hedge maze. He interrupts Felix having sex with a female guest who runs away, he feels hurt and confusion over Oliver's actions. Oliver tries to reason and perhaps flirt with him, but ultimately Felix rejects him and says he needs professional help. The next morning, Felix is found dead in the middle of the maze. During a tense family lunch, Oliver mentions that the night before Farleigh was taking and handing out drugs, implying a possible connection to Felix's death. James banishes Farleigh from Saltburn and cuts off all his financial support. After Felix's funeral, the Cattons question Oliver's presence, despite this, Elspeth insists that he may stay at Saltburn. Oliver mourns Felix desperately, returning to his grave, taking off his trousers and underwear, and penetrating the soil. One night, Venetia is in the bath distraught and inebriated. She accuses Oliver of disintegrating her family. He tries to seduce her again, but she is disturbed by his behaviour and rebuffs him. The following morning, Venetia is found dead in the bath, apparently suicide after slitting her wrists. James, despondent and suspicious of Oliver's continuing presence at Saltburn, asks him to leave. Oliver repeatedly insists that he cannot leave Elspeth in her hysterical state. But James realises Oliver is manipulative and furiously bribes him to disappear and never contact them again. Years later, Oliver is in a café reading a newspaper with an article that James has died. There, he has a chance encounter with Elspeth who is delighted to see him. She insists that he return with her to Saltburn, having not been there in some time herself. They spend several months together, but Elspeth suddenly falls fatally ill. Elspeth is in hospital on life support, and Oliver is there recounting all his actions. He reveals he had been responsible for all the tragedies that took place at Saltburn. Oliver deliberately punctured Felix's bike tyre in order to meet him, he poisoned Felix in the hedge maze after final rejection, he subtly manipulated Venetia into cutting and killing herself, and he fabricated the email that led to Farleigh leaving the estate. Finally, it is revealed that he planned his reacquaintance with Elspeth and that she subsequently left all the financial assets to him, including ownership of Saltburn. After all his confessions, Oliver forcefully removes the tube supplying oxygen for Elspeth, killing her. Now officially the owner of Saltburn and the Catton fortune, Oliver dances naked around the mansion to ""Murder on the Dancefloor"" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, and the death stones with all family names are displayed on a sideboard. Also starring Paul Rhys as Duncan the butler, Reece Shearsmith as Professor Ware, Lolly Adefope as Lady Daphne, Sadie Soverall as Annabel, and Millie Kent as India. Keoghan is compelling as the awkward young man who lingers in the mansion, Elordi plays the charming obnoxious rich boy well, Pike steals all her scenes with her great one-liners, Grant is reliable as always, Madekwe is good at being hateful, and Mulligan's cameo is welcome. What starts as a crush and wanting to fit in with the rich people goes in a dark direction you don't expect, it follows a familiar format where the wealthy eccentric characters are all unlikeable, it is funny when it needs to be, amusingly cringey and uncomfortable in moments, and the twists work relatively well, and the final scene and song choice is genius, it is certainly a memorable and worthwhile black comedy psychological thriller.

Saltburn,"Why is it the devil always seems to say the same story again and again, simple he wants to keep you here in his little world, tied around his finger. Saltburn is yet another twist told by the devil, saltburn represents escape from God and becoming your own god full of lusts and sins of the flesh while rejecting what is true, as the trailer says ""i don't think i'll ever go home again"" so too does this represent satan and his departure from Heaven to form his own false view full of pain and suffering, death and destruction all while heading down a path of corruption, he takes what is good and corrupts it and paints it as nice and shiny so when you eat the poison apple you don't feel so bad and you forget that you've been tricked into accepting a lesser view of paradise. Satan will promise you the whole world to convince you that God isn't real, he isn't worth it and he doesn't care about you, but in reality the one that doesn't care about you is the one that has a hold on you in this world of his and continuously feeds you poison to keep you trapped in his construct. Helluva Boss, Hazbin Hotel, Alice in wonderland these are all shows with the same message you're in a construct separated from God and you don't even know it, take the blue pill and continue to stay in this delusion, trapped in this broken world under satans non-stop propaganda machine, take the red pill and accept jesus christ, that he died on the cross, was buried, and on the third day rose again. You accept he's done this for you and you shall not perish but have everlasting life, you'll break free from satans deception, take the red pill and reconcile yourself with God so you can finally escape this false reality that keeps you entangled in this lie.","devil always seems say story , simple wants keep little world , tied around finger .

Far too long. Would have been worth one of those hour-long tv whodunits. Awful. As for the acting, well, lack of it. It must have been cobbled together in an afternoon. The characters aren't just wooden they are balsa wood and the ones who are known just play themselves.

Saltburn,"I want to restate THIS IS A GREAT FILM, in all aspects .... story, script, casting, directing, acting, cinematography, soundtrack and shocking ending. It really has it all and as such would have deserved a higher score, but for the unnecessary shock factor scenes that actually just made me feel uncomfortable and took me out of the whole viewing experience.Even for me, an extremely broad minded viewer who has watched and appreciated some very severe scenes in many films, certain parts in this movie went just slightly too far.The bathroom scene where Oliver spies on Felix pleasuring himself in the bath was clearly important to show that Oliver's love for Felix was far more than just as a friend or hero worship, BUT the lingering closeup of Oliver licking and sucking the bath water as it drains away was absolutely and totally unnecessary. It gave the viewer no additional insight into the story or characters and was purely added to shock and make the viewer feel awkward and uncomfortable.An even worse example was at Felix's funeral, when Oliver is left alone to show his grief. For me this was one of the most important scenes in the entire film. It clearly demonstrated Oliver's sole destroying loss of his greatest friend and someone he loved more than anyone or anything else. Made even more heartbreaking by the fact that you now realise Oliver had felt no option other than to kill Felix, as Felix was no longer going to have anything to do with him and would force him out of Saltburn. As he lay distraught on Felix's grave I actually began to shed a tear as it was so beautifully filmed. Then from nowhere he takes all his clothes off and appears to attempt to have sex with Felix on top of his grave. A GREAT SCENE AND ALL EMOTION TOTALLY DESTROYED !!!I understand certain films need to shock and borderline disgust the viewer momentarily, such as the horrific and gruesome Saw traps, which actually adds something to these scenes in that type of film, but in an excellent drama such as this I was genuinely taken out of the movie and any emotions, rather than being drawn even further into it. Very much like an unnecessary pit stop in a race, where you then have get yourself back in and rebuild momentum again.Writer's and director's should be horrified that these over the top and unnecessary shock sequences actually detract from the whole movie watching experience. It's not funny or clever to trick the ticket paying customers with this type of cheap and unnecessary shock factor !!!","want restate GREAT FILM , aspects ... . story , script , casting , directing , acting , cinematography , soundtrack shocking ending . really would deserved higher score , unnecessary shock factor scenes actually made feel uncomfortable took whole viewing experience.Even , extremely broad minded viewer watched appreciated severe scenes many films , certain parts movie went slightly far.The bathroom scene Oliver spies Felix pleasuring bath clearly important show Oliver 's love Felix far friend hero worship , lingering closeup Oliver licking sucking bath water drains away absolutely totally unnecessary . gave viewer additional insight story characters purely added shock make viewer feel awkward uncomfortable.An even worse example Felix 's funeral , Oliver left alone show grief . one important scenes entire film . clearly demonstrated Oliver 's sole destroying loss greatest friend someone loved anyone anything else .

A_Christmas_Story,"I started to like the movie in the first few minutes because it was portrayed in the 1940s (which for me is the golden age). A Christmas Story portrays Ralphie's story with his family and friends, showing moments of happiness, anger, disappointment, frustration, dream, desire among others.The film subtly addresses the issue of bullying, in addition to Ralphie's desires and imaginary mind, child's play (like sticking his tongue on a frozen pole), the disappointment of not getting what he wants right away, the anger of adults always denying their desire to own a Rifle, frustration at having put so much into writing the essay and not succeeding, the importance given to things that for adults are bullshit like joining the secret club.Despite being a film with children, the target audience is adults who, having already lived those experiences, can make a way back to childhood.","started like movie first minutes portrayed 1940s ( golden age ) .

A_Christmas_Story,"This movie is a poor and secular excuse to ruin a good holiday.Christmas is a beautiful holiday for religious people, and non-religious people. It's a time of celebrating Christ's birth (if you're religious) and giving (if you're not religious.) This film does no justice for either side of the holiday....Ralphie is an obnoxious little boy who whines all the time on how he wants a RED RYDER BB-GUN, and that's basically all he does. He's not even that cute a kid (I thought he looked like a child version of Drew Carey.) His brother is stupidly annoying, and his parents are dysfunctional idiots who should never have been allowed to have custody over their kids. I mean, I would have sought relationship counseling if my husband bought a lamp shaped like a Playboy bunny's leg. That's disgusting. But wait, she was an idiot, so what was I thinking? Ralphie beats the snot out of a bully kid, to the point where he's bloodier than Rocky Balboa was at the end of ""Rocky"". But when Ralphie's mom pulls him away from the bully, she doesn't check if he's okay. But I keep forgetting, she's an idiot. I mean, she thought Ralphie looked cute in his pink bunny PJs... that his idiot grandmother gave him. I'm surprised Ralphie didn't grow up to become a mentally insane serial killer.What's worse, is people are all like, ""It was like that when we were kids."" Really? Then, I pity you all who had to grow up with moronic mothers, obnoxious little siblings who acted like animals, fathers who bought Playboy lamps and cussed all the time, and grannies who sent you pink bunny PJs.Whats worse, is that the best version of this film is the 30 second version with bunnies. http://www.angryalien.com/aa/xmas_storybuns.asp And this isn't saying much.Please, buy ""A Christmas Carol"", or ""Miracle on 34th Street"", or ""It's a Wonderful Life"", if you want to watch a good Christmas classic.

The_Batman,"To preface this review I will say when watching this in the cinemas, many people walked out. I was looking over my shoulder to see of anyone else was laughing at what cringe this movie delivers.The actors in this were one of the highlights excluding the villain (the riddler) and the Batman. Penguin was by far the coolest and best actor. Honestly a good fellas type character. All other supporting actors were also quite good. I however think Robert pattinson a horrible pick for Batman. The whole time he seems like a really awkward and sad goth kid, I was half expecting him to say ""gosh get outta my room"". Absolutely trash acting The riddler was even worse! He was the major cringe factor in this movie with awful and dorky video calls where he is super non intimidating and laughable. His video calls reminded me of the horror films my 15 year old class mates had made in high school, their budgets were $0.The relationship between the Batman and cat woman was my only other plus in this movie. The romance was quite sweet and had a lot of tension. They rode around In their awesome motorcycles just roaring through the town it was really cute.The bat mobile was pretty awesome but definitely very weird for a Batman film. The old classic camaro was a little spine chilling not gonna lie.Now to answer everyone's questions I do think Robert pattinson was a terrible choice for Batman for a few reasons. At first I had no qualms but watching the film made me believe he was a bad and cringey actor for the role, he just isn't a badass over masculine kinda guy, like at all. He seems awkward and it shows. His voice wasn't that great, his body was not very big nor muscular like many other batmans, heck even the joker is ripped in suicide squad. The guy is 6ft exactly but his frame is tiny and it shows next to bigger actors. The story was God awful without spoiling pretty much lots of people die, bombs go off and some personal people Batman knows get injured. Then Batman goes welp I can't be in 3 places at once I'm only human. And proceeds to get ko'd twice throughout the movie and punched lots during fights. He is by far the worst and weakest looking Batman with the worst actor to have played him. The cinematography was good and the horror feeling this brings is good but everything else was just so horrible. Did I mention this film is 3 hours long to have a crap middle and end? Well know I know!. Wow I couldn't wait for thr 3 hours to end and multiple people walked out before the film was half finished. Definitely wouldn't reccomend this garbage piece of cinema. 2/10 for me.","preface review say watching cinemas , many people walked . looking shoulder see anyone else laughing cringe movie delivers.The actors one highlights excluding villain ( riddler ) Batman .

The_Batman,"You've seen a million Batman movies, but you still need to steel yourself for the darkest Dark Knight yet. Starring Robert Pattinson as DC's Caped Crusader, 2022's new movie The Batman is an intense, apocalyptic cinematic experience. Following the famous murder of Bruce Waynes parents, Wayne is two years into his crusade against Gotham City street crime. As Batman unpicks the cryptic clues, the investigation peels away a greater conspiracy. But the real riddle is how the ranting killer's twisted motive ties back to Batman himself. He Batman (in theaters March 4) is barely a superhero movie, Christopher Nolan's criminal politics and Zack Snyder's operatic brutality, plus the standalone Joker movie's psychological backstory, vaguely timeless design and layers of dark irony. Most of all, The Batman is a straight up horror film. This new flick is PG-13, but it's on a whole other level from the relatively bloodless Dark Knight movies -- and on a different planet from any Marvel film -- immersing you in a nerve-shredding three hours of escalating dread and simmering pain garnished with some astonishingly nasty, and dark touches, and makes think what one man can go through because of loosing his parents. You absolutely 100% can't show The Batman to a child, it will give them nightmares, and bad thoughts. Robert Pattinson's batman is lank-haired mess, and is a world away from Christian Bales outstanding professional look. This darkest Dark Knight may not be for everyone (and certainly not kids), but it's a gripping and nerve-shredding Bat-thriller. The one thing that Matt Reeves explores that Christopher Nolan doesn't is how dark and how can he make it to the story, and comic, and even a horror movie. The Batman should have been rated R not PG-13 because how intense, Dark and scary it is. The soundtrack was done by Michael Giacchino, its very graceful incorporation of specific themes for Batman and Selina, as well as pre-existing music ranging from classical pieces to Nirvana, provides tonal variation to ensure that The Batman never becomes a punishing downer. Go watch The Batman on March 4, 2022 at your Regal theater.","'ve seen million Batman movies , still need steel darkest Dark Knight yet .

The_Batman,"Absolutely abysmal garbage. Everything sucks in this film. The best aspect of the film is the action which is meh, and it's the only aspect which is meh, everything else is plain trash. It's so full of cliches to the point that it's probably the most uninspired Batman film ever made, there is absolutely no originality in this film at all. The blandest versions of the characters I've ever seen, none of them are any interesting. Same plotlines all over again just way worse than usual. Songs are not fitting here at all. All the detective stuff is lame as hell and predictable that I made a few jokes about what it could mean or lead to and they turned out to be true when I wasn't even intending to predict anything. Romance is so surface level and basic, there's no chemistry in it at all. Important characters are so plot-armoured, it's beyond lame and stupid with a bomb exploding just a few centimetres from the face and not even a scratch or a character surviving a huge bomb exploding just 1 metre away from him and he only got scratched a bit. The physics are beyond ridiculous with the car chase having some absurd crap happening you'd normally expect to see in Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing. The film runs for 3 hours and almost nothing remotely interesting ever happens, I only liked 2 scenes that run for 10 seconds - when Batman got out of the car after the car chase and the hallway fight in the dark, and those two 10 second moments are the best this film has to offer. It's beyond boring and so generic. In fact, it was so crappy that I literally laughed out through the entire film, I laughed at how bad a ridiculous most of the stuff was, it's so terrible.

The_Batman,"2h56m runtime! Ugh, another movie that thinks it's an epic. News alert: The Batman ain't an epic, it's just too long. Another thing this movie isn't: entertainment fit for an adult mind. How many more batboy movies are there going to be? The comics were written for pre-teen boys, so why has this childish myth held on so long? Nothing new has been added to the story of batboy. And sorry folks, calling it ""The Batman"" adds nothing new.So much of the film is shot in the dark that I'd estimate that about forty percent of the color in the movie is black, meaning you can't see much. I see this so much in films these days and I just don't get it. If you aren't comfortable with images, maybe these directors would be happier working in radio. There are also scenes in which we are looking through windows and can't really see very well. I don't get it. It's like they used a camera from about 1910.The violence is completely ridiculous starting from the first scene in the subway. There is no explanation for the group of thugs ganging up on the guy leaving the train. Batboy shows up and beats them senseless, although I'm not completely sure because it was too dark to see much.You can't even see what his car looks like despite the fact that there is a five-minute car chase scene in which a fat guy in a normal car evades batboy for most of it. One of the worst car chase scenes in movie history even though it probably cost more to film than the entire budgets of most movies made last year.","2h56m runtime !

The_Batman,"This film delivers a much darker and more sinister Batman, quite unlike the many versions that have gone before. The representation of Gotham as well, is steeped in corruption and decay. The story opens with the death of the city's mayor, and from there introduces the principal characters that are part of the Batman legacy that are known all too well by fans. In tone, I think this film was more like the ""Gotham"" cable series than any of the prior movies, even if that show had more to do with the young Bruce Wayne growing into the masked crime fighter. The villains both in ""Gotham"" and in this story personified the evil and malice that gripped Batman's hometown, with an added element of corruption in the background of Bruce Wayne's father that put him under the thumb of crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro).All of the performances here were exceptional. Robert Pattinson's take on Batman was more effective than his portrayal of Bruce Wayne, who looked like he was part of the grunge scene. I didn't much care for the Batman outfit, it looked unusually heavy and clunky; one's first inkling that Batman was arriving was heralded by the thumping footsteps one might associate with ""Jurassic Park"". Pattinson's voice as Batman, as well as those of Lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and The Riddler (Paul Dano) sounded like they were coming through a synthesizer. It made for dramatic effect, although not quite realistic.This film version of The Riddler is not like anything you've seen before or would have expected. His off-screen portrayals hinted at a demented masked vigilante, which made the actual appearance of the character that much more compelling when it revealed an almost baby faced Dano in the role of a psychotic madman. Quite honestly, it wasn't until the credits rolled that I became aware that Colin Farrell had the role of Oz, hidden underneath all the prosthetics and make-up. Yes, he was referred to as The Penguin, but it wasn't overdone, and his full name (Oswald Cobblepot) was never mentioned.Rounding out the principals was Zoe Kravitz as the slinky Catwoman, Selina Kyle. She had some major kick butt action in the film, and rose to the occasion to save Batman's near the end of the story. Speaking of which, even with his seemingly armor plated outfit, Batman appeared unusually vulnerable to attacks by his foes in the picture. It marked him as more human than the average super-hero with unusual powers.I will say this, your attention needs to be focused due to the nuances that are revealed in the telling of Bruce Wayne's parents' story and how he might have been misled growing up. His father's relationship with Falcone and fellow mob boss Salvatore Moroni bear on Gotham's reputation. Maybe it was inadvertent, but there might have been a subliminal tribute to the ""Gotham"" series here with the character of Falcone associate Kenzie (Peter McDonald). The role of James Gordon in that series was portrayed by Ben McKenzie.","film delivers much darker sinister Batman , quite unlike many versions gone . representation Gotham well , steeped corruption decay . story opens death city 's mayor , introduces principal characters part Batman legacy known well fans . tone , think film like `` Gotham '' cable series prior movies , even show young Bruce Wayne growing masked crime fighter . villains `` Gotham '' story personified evil malice gripped Batman 's hometown , added element corruption background Bruce Wayne 's father put thumb crime boss Carmine Falcone ( John Turturro ) .All performances exceptional .

Also, in one scene bomb exploded right in front of Batman and he didn't have single scratch, are you serious?Zoe(Catwoman) who made her actress and most importantly who selected her mask for catwoman, her mask looks like my grandfather monkey cap. Her acting is so bad, when she has dialogues, it seems like she's half asleep and couldn't deliver it.The whole movie was the question, what's the purpose of the movie and why so poor writing.","movie started thought 'll interesting new plot line new villains ' , director writing department lack vision . wrote whole movie without batman actual goal vision , Robert Pattinson literally 20 lines .

The_Batman,"An overrated and overhyped movie and I can't help starting with trivia. Director Matt Reeves had said that he wrote the role of Batman specifically keeping Pattinson in mind and that he would have been disappointed if he didn't do the role. He also mentioned that Pattinson as Batman was required to ""walk stealthily like a ghost"". To those uninitiated into Batman movies and expecting scenes of the superhero to engage in high voltage action , there is disappointment ahead. The movie is a sort of investigative journalism where our caped superhero ( Batman alias Bruce Wayne) is trying to find out the the criminals behind the killing of a few top people ( including Mayor) of the administration of Gotham city. The killer leaves behind clues in the shape of cards for Batman. Additionally Batman has to unearth the facts behind the killing of his father. Batman's transportation is a high powered motorbike on which he does his commuting when he is not driving his Batmobile. Paradoxically for a superhero movie it is slow moving and boring minus the few scenes of action. The cinematography is mostly with ""night effect"", in soft focus, gloomy and depressing with ominous background music. The movie has 175 minutes run time which makes it a difficult, taxing and exhaustive watch. You want to hit the fast forward button. Teenagers who come to this movie expecting Spiderman type of fare may be hugely disappointed. I don't think the director's plan of a ghost walking hero who whispers hoarsely was any good. It is intriguing to say the least. The catwoman ( Zoe Kravitz) is a welcome diversion and she has done well.( At least she speaks clearly and confidently ). Robert Pattinson fits into the director's concept of Batman which is the reason for the type of acting he does. Colin Farrel as Oz has facial makeup of hideous prosthetics. I will leave you with a pun of dark humour the killer leaves behind in a card. "" What does a liar do after he is dead.?

The_Batman,"As ""The Batman"" (2022 release; 176 min.) opens, it is ""Thursday, October 31"", and the Mayor of Gotham City is watching a city election debate on TV, only to then be killed by the Riddler. In a parallel story, Batman breaks up a gang in the streets of Gotham City. ""Who the hell are you?"" asks one of them. ""I am the vengeance"", responds Batman. At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this latest Batman is the vision of director and co-writer. Matt Reeves (""Let Me In"", ""War of the Planet of the Apes""). Let's get straight to that vision: it is darker as any other Batman I've seen, both literally and figuratively. Indeed, Batman avoids the daylight as much as possible (it hurts his eyesight), and much of the movie features a dark and very damp Gotham City. Batman himself cones across cold and aloof. Are you getting the overall sense? I fully realize that I am in the minority here, but when all was said and done, I didn't enjoy or care for ""The Batman"" all that much. It's too calculating and distant. Not too mention, it's way, way, way too long. The movie could easily have been trimmed by half an hour without losing any of its core narrative.""The Batman"" opened in theaters in early March but it was widely known that it would start showing on HBO and HBO Max a mere 45 days later, and that is where I saw it just the other days.

Not even with Batman.What about that mask of the catwoman? Did they have so much budget issue that they couldn't design a proper mask for her? And, the way they made it, what was the purpose of wearing that mask? Also, No proper backstory of her by which we can at least feel connected with her.

The_Batman,"We are now on ""The Batman."" I suppose such a title is to distinguish it from plain ol' ""Batman."" Like the football players who are from ""The"" Ohio State University or ""The"" University of Miami as though there are impostors of those same schools out there that they have to distinguish themselves from.Robert Pattinson plays Batman, and while his Batman is adequate, his Bruce Wayne was underwhelming. His Batman seemed to have fewer gadgets, but he did at least make his suit bulletproof. His Bruce Wayne was barely shown, and when he was it was as if he carried the pain and anger of Batman with him. All other Bruce Wayne's were able to turn on the charm when in public, this Bruce Wayne has the ""life sucks"" face.""The Batman"" opted to be more of a murder mystery than an action flick. There was action (even a scene involving the Penguin in which the audience applauded), but nothing like Batmans past.A glasses-wearing masked man was committing a string of murders. He was killing high profile members of Gotham and leaving cyphers for Batman to figure out. The movie doesn't hide that the killer is the Riddler, while it does hide his true identity. The Riddler was circuitously directing Batman and others to a particular criminal he wanted outed. Batman and Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) suspected that the Riddler's final target was either The Penguin (Colin Farrell) or Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Whether or not it's either of them is saved for close to the end.Speaking of the end, this movie was nearly three hours long, and I began to feel it. There was a point that the movie could've wrapped up, and I thought it was, then it dragged on for another half-hour or so. I was happy to be in the theater watching a movie, but not that happy. A two hour movie would've been just as satisfying. After watching all of the previews it made the movie-going experience well over three hours.How does this Batman stack up against the others? OK.

I enjoyed this movie even less than the Clooney version.The film has a good look for the most part and is like some of the comics but it is style over substance. The action scenes are very well done but they are very short and few between. If you saw the trailer, you have basically seen them and there will be no surprises.There are no characters in the movie you care about and Catwoman is annoying and physically unattractive yet they had to force a romance despite the actors having no chemistry.The Riddler is a serial killer that is murdering corrupt politicians. Do you really care that Batman stops him from killing these evil guys?One major thing this films lacks, especially considering it is a Batman movie, is a good villain. The Riddler is the main bad guy but he really isn't in the movie that much and never appears on screen with Batman. Even when he is caught, Batman watches outside a window as the police arrest him (this is somewhat shown in trailers). Batman later visits him in Arkham but they are once again separated by glass (also shown in the trailers).As for the acting, everyone just whispers in the movie, except for the Riddler who will randomly raise his voice in an attempt to act crazy.Thankfully, Robert Pattinson is no shown as Bruce Wayne much in the movie because he looks like Frankenstein's monster the times he is shown. You'd think it is a good thing to have so much Batman in a movie, but he mostly just stands around and whispers boring conversations.The worst thing about this movie is how boring it is. Batman is one of the most fun characters ever created but they sure managed to make him dull.","seeing trailer , thought film looked amazing turns one movies shows best parts trailer.It hard give movie 1 star rating well made easily boring Batman film ever made . enjoyed movie even less Clooney version.The film good look part like comics style substance . action scenes well done short . saw trailer , basically seen surprises.There characters movie care Catwoman annoying physically unattractive yet force romance despite actors chemistry.The Riddler serial killer murdering corrupt politicians . really care Batman stops killing evil guys ?

The_Batman,"I'm not sure where to begin as I don't generally want to spoil the reveals, but the big twists in the film were very anticlimactic. For 'The Batman'; Matt Reeves seemed to borrow from some of the bigger books such as 'Batman: Year One', 'Hush', and 'Batman: The Long Halloween'. Reeves also leaned heavily onto films such as 'The French Connection', 'Zodiac', and the noir classic 'Chinatown'. The general feel of the movie sought to relate Batman in the detective role that he's famous for in the comics, but unfortunately ignores any attempt at Batman's level of crime & mystery.The acting was really good. There's a great cast of professionals in this film, although Robert Patterson isn't allowed a range of emotion. Bruce Wayne and Batman are completely indistinguishable as the tired emo-kid who walks through life with severe lethargy. Colin Farrell is unrecognizable as the Penguin, and dare I say gave the greatest performance of his life. A large portion of the film is writing out a semi-origin story for Oswald Cobblepot and his rise to become Gotham's crime boss. A lot of the villains are the origin stories here. Batman (the character) is basically introduced the way he is in 'Batman: Year Two' and I thought that was a mistake. Year one of Batman would have been wonderful on screen. The audience seeing Bruce Wayne learning to use fear in his early days would have been a relief to this movie's ""Everyone is just scared of him."" plot device. Zoe Kravitz's performance as Selena Kyle becoming Cat Woman was under-developed, as she was so much fun to watch in 'The Batman' that I'd like to see this spin-off into a stand-alone Cat Woman release. Jeffery Wright was brilliant (of course) even remaining quiet in the Batman's background he pulled the attention onto himself, mostly because Patterson's portrayal was incredibly stiff. Paul Dano as The Riddler was exactly what I wanted to see in this movie. The character reached a new level of applause as a serial killer, but saddly that part of the plot was put on the back burner for the lackluster crime drama with Carmine Falcone. John Turturro was great as the crime boss Falcone, but the plot focused too long on his side story rather than offering more clues about the killings. It dragged on so long that it bored me completely. I went into 'The Batman' to see him match wits with a clever serial killer, not be re-educated about the connection between Thomas Wayne & Carmine Falcone again.The action sequences with the car chases and the fight choreography seemed old fashioned in a way. I knew before hand that Reeves lifted from some older better known films, but it's as if they dropped the budget on these scenes. Batman racing to catch the Penguin was an old muscle car Batmobile versus (what I'm guessing was) a 1980's Buick. I was laughing at this chase scene... it was presented with such seriousness that maybe if Penguin were in an expensive Italian sports car, I might have enjoyed it. But it was literally a supped-up car desperately trying to out pace my mom's car. The fighting was dull. Hand to hand combat is one of the first things Bruce Wayne learns before donning the cowl. But in this movie Batman is throwing punches a newly trained boxer would scoff at. So much of these scenes were empty and devoid of thrills and chills, that I wondered where the editor was.'The Batman' is simply too long. It's a ridiculous attempt to impress fans of it's own significance. It fails at cohesive story-telling and it basically pats itself on the back throughout the unnecessary musical score. Unlike the Dark Knight before it - I won't watch it again.","'m sure begin n't generally want spoil reveals , big twists film anticlimactic .

The_Batman,"Matt Reeves is not a good director at all-- -he's made one decent film, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and everything else he's done falls into one of two categories: junk and overrated junk. (Thank goodness The Batman is at least the latter instead of the former). If the director wasn't trying sooooo hard to make the film 'dark' maybe he could have created a new category of just overrated.Firstly, David Fincher himself is bad enough, but David Fincher imitations are even worse. This movie's rote serial-killer plot indulges in every single one of the irritating tropes that Nolan already played around with, most notably the 'but he wanted to be captured!' eye-roller. (Also irritating are Reeves' cheap attempts to desecrate Schubert's music while indulging the trope of the classical music-loving psychopath). Modern culture's obsession with and inadvertent glorification of serial killers is one of my greatest pet peeves---they are just pathetic and boring characters who are all the same. Exchange the Riddler for any of the killers in Fincher's movies and there is basically no difference. And it irritated me to no end how practically every character allowed themselves to fall prey to the Riddler's petty mind games- - if I was there I would promptly tell him to p*ss off and take his stupid video calls elsewhere, even if there was a bomb strapped to my neck.Secondly, the casting is sometimes bizarre. DC has often thrived on unorthodox casting-if they can make Ben Affleck work as Batman anything goes-but they trip up here since we have the high-water mark of the Nolan trilogy to compare it to. Andy Serkis as Alfred? That completely does not work; he just lacks the sophistication of Michael Caine. The new Commissioner Gordon is no Gary Oldman, that's for sure. The Riddler joins the swelling ranks of villains desperately trying to imitate Heath Ledger. (The Riddler from the '66 Batman show was vastly superior--heck, Jim Carrey was). The new Catwoman is alright given the rest of this casting, but is rendered irritating by a script that causes here to carry ON and ON about some friend of hers that ends up killed. Why she's so emotionally attached to this friend is a mystery not even Batman dares solve. The closest thing to a saving grace is the infamously unrecognizable Colin Farrell as the Penguin--- the car chase scene was great even as I kept wondering why none of the vehicles were hydroplaning with something like a full inch of water on the road.Thirdly, the pacing is off. I've seen people accuse Nolan of being portentous, but The Batman takes it to a whole new level with it's bloated runtime. It doesn't even have the quasi-grandeur of the Snyder Cut due to the banal serial killer story which mostly requires people to pop in and out of the Penguin's club ad nauseam. Reeves said that he was supposedly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock, but other than a 'Rear Window' throwback in the opening scene I don't see it. The film is mostly shot like a generic TV procedural filtered through a David Fincher lens, and Reeves completely lacks the morbid playfulness that made Hitchcock so sublime. (Compare any Riddler murder to the one in 'Dial M for Murder', which is one of the more mediocre Hitchcocks). Reeve's sole technique for suspense is to have the Riddler hovering around in the background while an unsuspecting victim putters about.Ugh. If any good this would have become DC's highest grossing film ever. As it is, people will lose interest after a little while and the box office receipts will drop.","Matt Reeves good director -- -he 's made one decent film , Rise Planet Apes , everything else 's done falls one two categories : junk overrated junk .

Scrooged,"Richard Donner's Scrooged, although fairly odd in places, is a visual opus of glassy New York nightscapes and a prancing Bill Murray sporting a grinchy attitude and a hairdo that would make Sonic the Hedgehog jealous. Murray plays ad TV mogul Frank Cross with a bitter resentment that's just this side of mean, but that's always been his charm, blurring the lines between comedy and drama, seriousness and farce until we're not quite sure what kind of performance we're getting from him. Thrill follows the standard Dickens play by play, showing us a regressed, antisocial prick who gradually opens up over the course of one magical Christmas Eve, after being visited by three ghosts. The standout here is David Johansen as the Ghost Of Christmas Past, here manifested as a howling lunatic of a cab driver, a decrepit old ghouls that keeps Frank on his feet via manic energy for his segment of the film. Carol Kane will puzzle as the swooning, creepy Ghost Of Christmas Present, a doped out Tinkerbell in her twilight years. There's wicked fun from other actors including John Forsythe, John Glover, Karen Allen as Frank's old flame, and a nice Yuletide vibe that's only hampered by an extremely out of place third act monologue from Murray that feels forced, demented and uncomfortable, otherwise, solid holiday fun:)","Richard Donner 's Scrooged , although fairly odd places , visual opus glassy New York nightscapes prancing Bill Murray sporting grinchy attitude hairdo would make Sonic Hedgehog jealous .

Scrooged,"Between directing Christmas-based action movie Lethal Weapon and its inevitable sequel, Richard Donner gave us a different kind of Christmas classic... Scrooged, a contemporary reimagining of Dicken's seasonal favourite A Christmas Carol. The film opens very much in Lethal Weapon mode, with machine guns ablazing, as Lee Majors helps Santa in his fight against heavily armed terrorists; this scene is from 'The Night the Reindeer Died', one of the many programmes scheduled for the festive break by cynical TV station president Frank Cross (Bill Murray), for whom the holiday season means one thing only: a chance to up the station's viewing figures.As Cross prepares the jewel in his scheduling crown, a live broadcast of A Christmas Carol, he finds himself visited by his long-dead boss (John Forsythe), who tells him he will be visited by three ghosts: The Ghost of Christmas Past (David Johansen), who reminds Frank of his biggest regrets; The Ghost of Christmas Present (a hilariously oddball turn by Carol Kane), who shows him how his current horrible behaviour is affecting others; and The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who shows him his not-so-bright future. These three visitations trigger a Scrooge-like change of heart in Frank, who, in the feel-good finale, understands what Christmas is really all about, broadcasts a cheery message, leads a sing-along, and hooks up with old flame Claire Phillips (Karen Allen).Like a trial run for his only-slightly-less-contemptuous character in Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's Frank makes the absolute most of the SNL star's acerbic brand of wit. Murray is the linchpin of the film, but his dry sarcasm is perfectly complemented by the more eccentric turns from Johansen and Kane, who provide many of the film's most memorable moments (Kane, dressed in fairy costume, but packing a mean punch, manages to be frighteningly unhinged yet strangely alluring). Also, Bobcat Goldthwait, as sacked station employee Eliot Loudermilk, is as bizarre as always, especially when he turns up toting a shotgun to take revenge on his boss (the uplifting ending to the film spares showing him being gunned down by trigger-happy cops).Donner proves just as adept at comedy as he is at action and horror (he gave us the '70s classic The Omen), giving us an assured slice of slick entertainment that, while not overly stylish, still impresses with its charming pre-digital visual effects, plus great make-up by Tom Burman (Forsythe's zombie make-up is superb). There's also one particular moment that stands out to me as truly macabre: Frank has freaky visions while talking to his boss in a restaurant, including a waiter catching fire. A one-of-a-kind, demented-yet-touching, Dickens-inspired classic with scenes of agonising fiery death: that's Scrooged!","directing Christmas-based action movie Lethal Weapon inevitable sequel , Richard Donner gave us different kind Christmas classic ...

With exception to Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day, this is probably one of his most hilarious performances to date. In this re-working of Dickens ""A Christmas Carol"" , Murray plays Frank Cross, a tight fisted,selfish Network Executive who, as christmas rapidly approaches, finds himself needing to hasten up proceedings on his networks live Christmas Carol show, which is airing on Christmas eve. From the very start of the film, we are treated to how unkind and selfish, Murrays character really is, yet we still cant bring ourselves to hate him.....even when he suggests to a prop man that he should STAPLE little plastic antlers to the heads of door-mice.Due to a very creepy encounter with his dead boss, Cross is warned that he will be visited by 3 ghosts, and so the story takes off, as he meets 3 very unusual ghosts with even weirder traits, such as the ghost of christmas present, who likes to randomly beat Cross up, every time he shows no heart.

I could prattle on (as I am wont to do) about the uninspired rewrite of the Dickens' classic, the wasted talents of notables such as David Johansen and Carole Kane, and the general Hollywood pitfall of missing the whole damn point of an otherwise good story! But I won't. Well, not much anyhow.At the center of this story-within-a-story, Bill Murray's character's TV station is about to put on a star-studded version of ""A Christmas Carol."" I don't know how or why this could have happened, but they keep referring to the story as simply ""Scrooge."" Of course, this was the name of the musical remake, but the show in the film is not the musical. Yet they continue throughout the film to refer to it as ""based on Charles Dickens' immortal 'Scrooge.'"" Who was in charge of research on this film? why didn't the best boy or lead man or hairdresser speak up and say, ""Uh, guys? That's not actually the right name."" A perfect example of Hollywood spending lotsa cash and producing garbage.Okay, I can't help it: A thing that really bothered me was the final ghost visitiation. When Bill Murray watches his body being cremated and then finds himself in the coffin is a complete misrepresentation of that point of the original story. Scrooge is moved by seeing his own grave, not because he is dead, but because he realizes he will die all alone, with not one to mourn his passing. I wish I could say ""Scrooged"" was destined for the same lonesome fate, but it is so damn annoying I can't stop babbling about it.There.

Scrooged,"Acerbic studio president, often loud and abrasive to those under his employ, gets a visit from three ghosts(and his deceased former boss, for whose place he took over, who prepares him for what awaits)who take him into the past, present, and future, in this noisy, brash, and often acidic satire on the Christmas season, taking shots at Charles Dickens' immortal story of Ebenezer Scrooge. Bill Murray never, to me anyway, looked comfortable in the role of Frank Cross, someone who polarizes everyone he comes in contact with, completely concerned with only his own needs and wants. John Glover is Brice, hired by the the leader of the studio, Preston(Robert Mitchum, who presents his character as if he's approaching senility), a potential problem for Frank's future as the man calling(most)of the shots. Glover is full of energy and enthusiasm, a ""people's guy"" who talks a mile a minute and seems very persuasive in gaining the favor of those around him.The first ghost(I'll get to Forsythe in a minute)is David Johansen(from the New York Dolls), Christmas Past, who drives a taxi cab full of smoke from his cigars, kind of resembling a chain-smoking, yellow-teethed elf(his has Vulcan ears)you might dig up in an alley somewhere catching zzz's in a cardboard box. Ghost Past carries him to his home as a child(whose meat market father is portrayed by Bryan Doyle Murray), not to mention, we see the love passed up for a career in radiant Karen Allen's Claire Phillips. The second is fairy Carol Kane, Christmas Present, with wings and a tutu, all sparkly, who enjoys smacking around Frank, punching him in the face repeatedly, as they visit his underpaid secretary's happy(if fatherless due to his murder)home and brother's party with friends. It's here Frank begins to see how empty his life is. The third is a ridiculously large, hulking Reaper as The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come and Frank's visits (with the visual stylings of surrealistic art deco) involving his secretary Grace's visit to her mute son in a padded cell and Claire, now a cold hearted bitch who yells for pauper kids to leave her midst, are simply bizarre(and lack any form of emotional depth). The problem is when Frank ""finds the errors of his ways"" in regards to walking over innocent people to get to the top, it doesn't ring true or have any form of sincerity. Murray constantly barks loudly throughout the movie and never really captures your heart. This whole movie reeks of cynicism, and sadly lacks the Murray charm. I dunno, in the past I've enjoyed this movie, but this year it's so hollow and so many of the characters come off annoying and/or aggravating, especially Carol Kane who I wanted to see in a choke hold until her eyes popped out. Steller make-up work on Forsythe who informs Frank of the three ghosts' visits, a rotted corpse, with little flesh, mainly bones and dust. John Murray(Bill's actual brother)portrays Frank's brother, James. Alfre Woodard is Grace, Frank's beleaguered secretary. Bobcat Goldthwait is the poor employee who tells(correctly)Frank that his commercials for a bloody horror movie, SCROOGE(in name only), are ill advised, getting sacked in the process. Bobcat, drunk, unemployed, his wife having left him, goes berserk attempting to kill Frank with a shotgun at the end.

Scrooged,"I have always defended Richard Donner, so I'm going to let him get a pass on this one, since we know it's a movie he rarely brings up, doesn't feel like a Donner flick and most likely wouldn't answer to it anyway. Suppose the real answer is...they set out to make a annual traditional film. Which they did. Sort of. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I cared about. And I think most people mistake the nostalgia of it for the reality. Which is...it stinks.I've watched this at a kiddee matinee at The New Beverly Theater when parents brought their children. It was met with very strange silence. And as the end sing-a-long occurs there was a bizarre mood. No one knew if this was a comedy, a drama or a feel good Christmas flick. The answer is: It's the Bill Murray Hour! And nothing else mattered.In this case a painful hour and forty something minutes.Written by Murray friend Mitch Glazer, this was a vehicle to make Murray more...commercial. Instead, he digs himself into a deep pit of tap dancing that becomes WAY too much. Hint: Murray, you're not THAT kind of funny. Understate Murray is better than this flailing nut. Which, of course, Murray blames Donner. And if Donner would speak of it, sure he would blame Murray.
So here we are, a drudgery of a redemption story played by someone so depleted of humanity that the end seemed so shallow tacked on feel good soliloquy vomited by someone we know doesn't feel an inch of what he is saying. Because the structure of the flick has it that he turns spots because HIS own fate was the reason.
While the original Dickens does paint him to be this selfish, there was always a moment in ALL the re-telling of Dickens that he at the very least felt a twinge of regret for the pain he's inflicted in others. In this instance, it's thwarted by Murray's inability to not be a ""man."" Sorry, it feels more like a guy any person today would pummel in the alley.
See, the real problem is...it is a dated product. References to Richard Pryor's freebasing mishap, Solid Gold dancers, Mary Lou Retton and Lee Majors plays great with Gen Xers like me. Because we were around the age this was meant for. That history is lost to the ages. As is this odd ""Free Africa"" bur Donner can't shake during this era (by the way, Dick, how did that work out? The ones in charge now imploded South African economy. Have you ever apologized for being on the wrong side of history?).
This was a forced un-fun dreadful drag through a tale that should've been heartfelt.
The ""jokes"" land with a thud (Murray isn't funny, he's...a dramatic actor trapped in the perception that he is a comedian).
There was something here that I can't put my finger on. Like...the people who slapped it together seemed to think so little of Christmas or New Yorkers.

The 3 stars I'm giving it is a generous rating, and it pains me to say that, since I generally enjoy Bill Murray quite a bit.
However, as most of the other negative reviews here note, he is dreadful in this retelling of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"". Others have pointed out that he seems uninvolved in the movie but I'm going more with those who feel his performance suggests he's more contemptuous of it than anything else. Shouting, scowling and declaiming his lines in a perfunctory devoid of any true emotionalism, he's exhausting and tiresome to watch. His ""redemption"" at the grand finale is utterly unconvincing and a drawn out mess that feels tacked on and perfunctory.Only David Johansen and Carol Kane bring any life to the film while Robert Mitchum, John Forsythe and Karen Allen are largely wasted in their thankless and underdeveloped roles.

Scrooged is an ugly mess punctuated by random, unnecessary violence and sexual innuendo. This is indeed a dark film, as other reviewers have noted, but without a deeper meaning or purpose. The writers seem to have written it simply for the dubious pleasure of wallowing in their hatred for the holiday itself.The predictable ending, which is nauseating in its insincerity, made me cringe with embarrassment for Murray. He rants madly about how he ""gets it"" and beseeches viewers to spread a little Christmas cheer and goodwill into their everyday lives.

Scrooged,"Bill Murray grabs the reins and refuses to let go in this almost-one-man-show modernization of A Christmas Carol. It's a dark, biting and sarcastic take on the tale that's set firmly in the murk of the corporation-friendly '80s, but it completely falls apart on the back nine. The first act is an inspired lampoon of bad network television (and the bad network executives behind it) with Murray, deliciously sinister as the worst boss in America, at the height of his powers. It's when the narrative tries to cram in a tepid love story and a sudden, jolting redemption that the cornerstones begin to crumble. This really could've worked if it didn't wear its intentions and inspirations so garishly on its chest, but subtlety is, sadly, not among the picture's attributes.

Scrooged,"Scrooged is based on A Christmas Carol (or something like that) by Charles Dickens where uncle Scrooge, a miserly old man, is visited by a three ghosts, and shown how nasty he really is, and thus in the end he changes and becomes a nicer person. A sickly moral by an idealistic author who really couldn't get over the fact that his father was a mean and nasty old man.This movie has Bill Murry playing the Uncle Scrooge character who is actually a TV executive that is just as miserly. After treating everybody like dirt, he is visited by a grotty taxi-driver who is the ghost of Christmas past, a psychotic fairy who is the ghost of Christmas Present, and of course death.Though I liked the psychotic fairy, I really found that this movie was even more dull and boring that Ghostbusters and really couldn't wait for it to end. There was so much moralistic rubbish in this movie that it made me sick. It was like most people are sweet and innocent and don't deserve the rubbish that they get. Okay, Murry's character was a not a very nice person, but I simply did not like the fact that a character like his changes so quickly. Oh sure, it does happen, but this is a fantastic movie set in a fantasy world where everybody turns out to be good little boys and girls and to me that is just putrifying.The critics described this as being a dark, depressing movie with a tragically flawed character.

Scrooged,"First let's get one thing straight
I do not like Bill Murray's performances
One of the only shows that i have found him reasonable chi's in Groundhog Day
All his performances are putrid in all the shows I have seen him in
He is loud, rude, obnoxious, idiotic, a big mouth arrogant and totally unlikable
I don't know what he is like off stage but onstage chev comes through as a totally despicable person
Even in Groundhog Day he was the same but he redeemed himself at the end
Likewise with Jim Carey
There is only one movie I have enjoyed him in and that is Liar Liar
As one critic said many of the scenes were most definitely not for children
The violence in this movie although dubbed as slapstick are very much over the top both with the ghost of Christmas present and the fired employee
It was interesting to see him playing a different role compared to the one he played in POLICE Academy
He still retains his squeaky voice
The Ghost of Christmas Present is the biggest turn off of the whole movie
The Ghost of Christmas was worthy of a horror movie
Definitely not for children
The only reason why I watched the show is because I had it on DVD and the DVD also found the show reprehensible and stopped working 25% into the show so I wanted to see the whole movie
I'm sorry I did
This is one show I would take and throw in the dustbin
The ending was lousy as well yetbthst was really the only redeeming feature of the show
It wasn't the finale but the song Put a Little Love in your heart that's gets the show 2/10 rather than a one out of ten.As far as I'm concerned this show is a total mockery and an insult to the Original Christmas Carol

Scrooged,"After Bill Murray struck gold with Ghostbusters in 1984, he dropped off the radar a little. His personal project The Razor's Edge flopped with audiences and critics, and I think that must have been a blow to him. Besides making a cameo in the amusing Little Shop of Horrors, he stayed away from the Hollywood circuit for four years.But then in 1988 he resurfaced with Scrooged, an update on the classic Charles Dickens tale. Obviously trying to repeat the success of Ghostbusters, Scrooged was a modest hit with audiences, who considered it Murray's comeback role.When I was younger, I loved Scrooged. I thought it was funny and delivered on so many levels. But as I've gotten older, Scrooged has gone down considerably in my estimation. Instead of feeling funny, it now feels laboured, and forced. And I never thought I would say this, but the main reason Scrooged doesn't work is because of Bill Murray.Bill Murray is one of my favourite comedians. In fact I think he's one of the funniest men alive. His dry, laconic outlook on life is nearly always hilarious. Just look at some of the gems he's turned out. Ghostbusters. Groundhog Day. Lost in Translation and the sadly overlooked Broken Flowers.But then there's Scrooged. A film that should have been a perfect vehicle for Murray's talents, but it never even gets out of the gate. And I blame that on Murray, sadly. He did the theme of a miser seeing the error of his ways to much greater effect in the absolutely wonderful Groundhog Day, which is my personal favourite comedy of the 90s.In Scrooged, Murray is the borderline power-mad TV exec Frank Cross. A man so consumed by greed and hate he thinks nothing of firing employees if they even look at him the wrong way. Frank is on a dangerous path, and will lose everything if he doesn't change his ways. And so step in the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future to show Frank what he's missed out on in life.There is some invention during the scenes of ghostly visitations. The Ghost of Christmas Past is a grizzled New York cab driver. The meter is actually a calender that shows the year Murray is in. The Ghost of Christmas Present (a horribly screechy performance by Carol Kane) is like an insane Sugar Plum Fairy with a nasty habit of punching Frank repeatedly. The Ghost of Christmas Future is just as Dickens left it. Except it has a TV for a face.Usually I like Christmas tales with dark centres, like the excellent Nightmare Before Christmas and the hilarious Gremlins. Two brilliant films that succeed on every level. But sadly, Scrooged doesn't deliver. Whenever Bill Murray is in a film, he's usually the best thing about it. Here he's the worst. He's clearly not having a good time. He approaches each scene with indifference. When he's hands on with material, he can deliver superb performances. But he's strictly hands off with this film. And as a result, it makes his supposed redemption in the final scenes that all the more false.There are occasions where his trademark sarcasm shines. I liked the scene where he collects an award for Humanitarian of the Year. Its funny because Murray is notorious for shunning the award ceremonies, and his clear distaste for the Oscars is mirrored in that scene. His acceptance speech is a marvellous send-up of the countless celebrities who stand up to the mike and drone on and on about their achievements.But elsewhere Scrooged falls flat. There is no evidence that Frank is slowly thawing. And because Murray overacts badly in this film (strange considering that he prefers minimalist acting), I couldn't believe for a second what I was seeing. Murray spends a lot of his time shouting his way through the film to the point that it becomes tedious.In the supporting cast, we do get some occasional rays of sunshine. John Glover is hilarious as the exec brought in to lighten the burden on Frank's shoulders, when really he's after his job. John Forsythe sports an astonishing makeup job as Frank's old boss, who appears as a decaying corpse, the film's version of Marley's Ghost. And the underrated Karen Allen shines as the woman Frank gave up for the sake of his career.But its in the final scenes where Scrooged comes crashing down. Frank has seen the error of his ways. And to prove it, he barges on to the set of a live retelling of A Christmas Carol the TV studio is putting on. Frank goes on and on (and on) about the true meaning of Christmas. And its a horrible thing to see. Murray doesn't sound like he believes a word of what he's saying. It seems to go on forever. And I felt really embarrassed for him.What a pity! Scrooged could have been a hip, witty deconstruction of A Christmas Carol. And nobody does nasty and sarcastic better than Bill Murray. Where did it all go wrong then? How did it so completely miss the mark? Shame considering it came from Richard Donner, the man behind classics like Superman and The Omen. And such a waste of Robert Mitchum and John Houseman.Very poor, and ultimately very depressing too.","Bill Murray struck gold Ghostbusters 1984 , dropped radar little . personal project Razor 's Edge flopped audiences critics , think must blow .

Scrooged,"In a movie that is supposed to be about redemption and becoming a better person this movie forgot to include it. From beginning to end it's just Bill Murray being Bill Murray. There are some funny parts Carole Kane and Bobcat Goldthwait both deliver. However the plot makes no sense. He hasn't seen his old girlfriend in 10 years calls her once and she's magically back in love with him despite all following interactions with him being crazy, rude, and insulting. Oh and before he gives his ""heartfelt"" speech about how much he loves her he makes out with a blonde showgirl on TV because there is mistletoe which makes it the law. This then makes it ""okay"" for the studio woman ethics and standards woman to make out with the ""bad guy"" while he is tied up against his will. Also why are we supposed to think this guy's the bad guy anyways? All he has done is the job he was hired to do and every time he's interacted with Bill's character he has been acting insane. How the movie makers thought having a crazed gunman hold the studio hostage so Bill's character could make an equally crazy speech was a good idea is beyond me. Bottom line is I didn't feel the redemption just because some guy decided that it really wasn't actually a good idea to staple antlers to a mouse and that everyone should be forced to party and sing at gunpoint.Some laughs, bad plot, an okay movie I never need to see again.","movie supposed redemption becoming better person movie forgot include . beginning end 's Bill Murray Bill Murray . funny parts Carole Kane Bobcat Goldthwait deliver .

Scrooged,"""Scrooged"" opens in the clouds, and then suddenly descends on a snowbound cottage. Signs inform us that it's Santa's workshop and we're at the North Pole. Inside, elves work hastily as Santa prepares himself for his impending duty on Christmas Eve night. But then, terrorists, packing some serious heat with them, lay siege to the workshop.Panicking, Santa, Mrs. Claus, and the elves run towards the back of the shop, open a tool cabinet, which reveals an arsenal of M-16s, and soon everybody's armed to the hilt with automatic weaponry. But then Lee Majors appears on a snowmobile and reassures Santa that Christmas will be coming on time this year. Then Lee goes to work killing the terrorists with a large Gatling gun.Then we're treated to a promo spot for a television production of ""Scrooge,"" which features a bloody highway shooting, a plane blowing up, and drug addicts taking heroin. It is this sort of cynicism that's underlying in much of the subtext of this film, and it's also something that Frank Cross (Bill Murray), ""the youngest television president in network history,"" thrives on.And so opens ""Scrooged,"" director Richard Donner's contemporary take on Charles Dickens's classic tale ""A Christmas Carol."" Dickens's novel has been fodder for countless television, film, and stage productions over the 150+ years it has been an accepted part of American literature, and this 1988 dark comedy is the latest incarnation.The biggest reason it has is because it describes the need for mankind to not be so selfish, and it takes three ghastly apparitions over the course of a 24-hour period to show an old miser the error of his ways.But all of this is in the past. Cross is so swept up in himself, that he gives bath towels to everyone (even his only brother) on Christmas. He asks his loyal secretary Grace (Alfre Woodard) to stay late at work, despite the fact that she has to take her mute son to the doctor. (""I care!"" Frank says, when she confronts him about it.) He fires an underling named Eliot (Bobcat Goldthwait) for questioning him about his un-Christmas-like promo ads. He shuns Claire (Karen Allen), the only woman who's ever cared about him when she tries to provide comfort for the homeless. Yeah, Cross is every bit as a unsavory as most misers are when it comes to ""A Christmas Carol.""But life is about to change for Frank, and that's marked by the sudden and (literally) explosive appearance of the rotting corpse of his late boss. The walking, talking ""worm feast"" informs Frank that he's going to be visited by three ghosts over the next 24 hours, and this may be his last chance to change his ways. And from there on, it's ghastly, darkly comic hilarity as Frank goes back, forward, and stays in the present as three ghosts (a manic cabbie, a jilted, abusive fairy, and a towering, cloaked skeleton, respectively) take him on a wild ride through his life.Bill Murray is at his comic best here, getting ""Scrooged"" the way someone in his position should. Much like the lead character in ""A Christmas Carol"" realizes the error of his ways, Frank Cross does so too, but with a kind of cynicism that could only be provided by someone as indifferent, uncompromising, and selfish as him. And he's also quite aware from the appearance of the first ghost of what this trip entails.The makeup and special effects are also worthy of some mention. The ghosts all look fantastic, even though some would argue that the effects that brought them to life are dated; well, this movie was made in 1988 for crying out loud!I liked ""Scrooged,"" as it is certainly a fantastic Christmas movie to watch, and is quite funny, especially just to see Murray get his comeuppance in a role that seems to suit him perfectly.Watch Bill Murray get ""Scrooged"" - 10/10","`` Scrooged '' opens clouds , suddenly descends snowbound cottage .

The_Holiday,"Seriously, it was like someone had spilled Fondue over everything it was that cheesy. It was also completely predictable and formulaic. Winslet and Diaz overacted (and badly so) throughout the whole movie.I was actually cringing when Cameron's character tells Jude that her family was so close they used to call themselves ""The three Musketeers""! In fact, I was actively cringing for most of the film. I thought Kate Winslet's character was excessively stupid for being in love for three years with a cardboard man that used her when he needed to and then ran back to his fiancée. And to get over him she decides all she needs is two weeks in LA?

The only thing I liked about the film was Jack Black but he was woefully underused. It was also as if the director told him "" OK we're going for completely formulaic here, NO IMPROVISING, no off-the-cuff funny stuff, nothing, just work from the script"".

The_Holiday,"I should have known better. No, I did know better, but the Missus insisted that we go see this year's Christmas chick-flick called ""The Holiday"". What can I say? It's ""Love Actually"" all over again only worse. Every cliché, every little bit of kitsch you could possibly think of is here. It's a wonder Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant aren't in this.The story is incredibly boring and not funny for a moment. Its cutesiness is the worst thing about it. Like Jude Law's character. Aww... he's a father of two kids. Aww... he's a single father, but he's not divorced, no, his wife died. Aww...she died two years ago, so it's okay for him to walk around drunk fcuking blonde strangers. Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's what the movie is like. Like it or not.What's even worse, though, is that there isn't just one boring storyline, no, there are TWO! ""The Holiday"" is an example of how parallel storytelling can go wrong. The only thing I could think about while almost falling asleep during Law and Diaz' incredibly dull romance was that there was still another dull romance to dissolve before I could finally leave and go home. As much as I like Kate Winslet and Jack Black in other movies they were just as bad as everything else here. And their storyline has even got a ""lovely"" old man in it, which made things even more horrific.If you find yourself contemplating suicide while watching this movie, don't worry. It's not you who's too cynical, it's the movie that's too damn sweet. Oh, and in defense of my Missus it must be said that she hated the movie, too. Thank God.

Thanksgiving,"It's Thanksgiving in Plymouth, Massachusetts. More importantly, it's Black Friday in RightMart. A large crowd has gathered and waiting for the opening. Eric Newlon (Patrick Dempsey) is the Sheriff. Thomas Wright (Rick Hoffman) is the greedy store owner. His daughter Jessica Wright and her friends are allowed into the store before the opening. It starts a riot and people die in the ensuing chaos. It's a year later and nobody has been brought to justice. Thomas is doing another sale despite a feared repeat of the incident. A masked serial killer is on the loose.This is an Eli Roth horror. There are so many A-hole characters. Then I remember that it's an Eli Roth horror. Of course, it's filled with A-hole characters. Here's the thing. This is actually not that bad despite some ridiculous ideas. First, Black Friday is no longer this anymore with all the internet shopping. I don't care about these characters.

Thanksgiving,"I thought this may be an occasion where not watching the trailer hindered my experience but having watched the trailer retrospectively, it is clear that this movie advertised itself as a film that took itself seriously but that was certainly not the case...Thanksgiving is a who dun it slasher in the vain of SCREAM. However, the violence was ridiculously over the top in the fashion of the Evil Dead Rise movies. Despite this, the film dialled the campiness all the way to 100% and that really messed with the tone of the movie. The jokes were shoe horned in all over the place and didn't work.Moreover, I didn't find there to be any redeeming qualities. The characters who were predominantly a teenage school group, who were not interesting at best and at worst they were cliche and frustrating. They made several deleterious decisions and seemed to be incapable of doing anything to improve their situation.I welcome scares and gore in horror movies but the extreme deaths felt wasted and gratuitous given the inconsistent tone of the film. Some of the death were so over the top that they seemed to be attempting comedy whilst others seem to focus on pure horror.Whilst the likes of SCREAM or even Totally Killer manages to strike a perfect tonal balance and knows what it wants to do, Thanksgiving didn't have a clear direction which left me disinterested and confused.

Thanksgiving,"""Thanksgiving"" is a serviceable horror film that touches upon all the high school horror tropes. Jocks, nerds, party kids, cheerleader, and so forth. The template is so mid that what you find yourself waiting for is the kills. The murderer isn't that hard to figure out. It's essentially the person whom you know during the Black Friday stampede is the one who is the most traumatized.Was this a social commentary on capitalism? Not in the least. It is really a commentary on horror films of the 80's and 90's.Though director Eli Roth finds gruesome ways to dispense with the annoying teens, for the most part it gets tiresome to watch the gore. And there is also very uneven smirks. Such as when the first victim is murdered, the police are going over the viscera whilst we are (I think) suppose to be laughing. It's sadism from behind the camera.The movie does give you what you want. The kills are associated with the holiday. All the victims have their heads chopped off and placed at the table. And it doesn't take long for the killer (named Carver since he wears a John Carver mask) to make quips as he kills.The motivation for the killings aren't entirely convincing. Though, much like what its being influenced by, the killed are worthy of being killed. They are obnoxious. And, and a lot of points, really find yourself cheering for the killer. Even when the final girl is fleeing, you want her to be done in as well.The Plymouth, Mass. Locale adds a really nice mood. But there are too many logistical quirks to elevate this movie to anything other than a curious look. A total matinee priced flick.","`` Thanksgiving '' serviceable horror film touches upon high school horror tropes .

Thanksgiving,"Though it's very formulaic, this film, it's still at the better end of recent gore-fests. We start off with the most unlikely of scenarios - a Thanksgiving sale at a supermarket that goes spectacularly and violently wrong. The population of the founding father's very own Plymouth in Massachusetts become frenetic and determined to do whatever it takes to get into this store and get their free waffle iron! Anyway, a group of kids manage to sneak in first and provoke the waiting crowd - that leads to a stampede with tragic results. Scoot on twelve months and the same store is proposing to have anther such sale, despite the fatalities last time round that led to no prosecutions thanks to some security camera ""errors"". Sheriff ""Eric"" (Patrick Dempsey) is concerned for public safety but that's just the start of his woes. When the rather odious and foul mouthed waitress ""Lizzie"" (Amanda Barker) is found - well half of her is found - stuck to the store's illuminated signage, he must find the culprit before there are even more revenge attacks by the masked pilgrim... Yes, we've seen this all before but here Eli Roth takes a cast that might have been graduates from Ben Platt's ""Theater Camp"" (2023) and turns them into prey for a menacing killer who certainly has some imagination when reeking his havoc on those who did him wrong. It takes a swipe at the commercial culture around this American holiday - rather well presented via Rick Hoffman's store-owning ""Thomas"", father or our lead ""Jessica"" (Nell Verlaque) and husband to the really rather shallow ""Kathleen"" (Karen Cliche). There's a bit of boyfriend rivalry that accidentally displays the versatility (?!) of Milo Manheim who quite successfully ditches his butter wouldn't melt image (anyone seen ""Journey to Bethlehem""?) before a suitably far-fetched denouement that does take it's time, repeats itself a bit and concludes screaming sequel. There are some some funny moments, the cast largely gel well and though not exactly scary, there are a few effective jumps. I doubt that you'll recall it for long after, but I think this is actually quite good.","Though 's formulaic , film , 's still better end recent gore-fests . start unlikely scenarios - Thanksgiving sale supermarket goes spectacularly violently wrong . population founding father 's Plymouth Massachusetts become frenetic determined whatever takes get store get free waffle iron !

Thanksgiving,"After promising ""white meat ... dark meat ... all will be carved, this Thanksgiving,"" director Eli Roth delivers,"" 16 years later, and it's a disappointing slasher that doesn't carve well. It features the worst characters I have ever seen in a slasher movie with dialogue that sounds fed through a pasta maker. Every character in this movie is a scumbag, and all we're left with is gory deaths, a killer whose identity reveal is underwhelming and Police that are so dumb they don't know if they are going left or right trying to catch the killer.If you remember ""Grindhouse"" back in 2007, ""Thanksgiving,"" was one of the fake trailers along with, ""Machette,"" and the disgusting ""Hobo With a Shotgun,"" filmed in Atlantic Canada. Roth is known for his over-the-top gory horror films such as ""Hostel,"" and ""Cabin Fever,"" and, for the first time, he holds himself back by changing a ""key"" scene from the fake trailer. I'm sure he knew It would get him in trouble because it's 2023, and the watchdogs that polarize horror films would come after him. Perhaps he thought nobody would remember the infamous ""cheerleader"" scene, or maybe it's because the ratings board would have come after him for such a scene? I will get to that.It opens on Black Friday, where a volatile mob storms the Black Friday sale at RightMart, and they are so over the top, it's not believable because the city Police would be everywhere for the chaos they are creating over free waffle irons. They storm the doors like animals, leaving several people injured, trampled and dead. Someone critical to the story gets killed, and I knew from the moment I saw this scene, It was going to have something to do with the events that unfold. Maybe I have seen too many of these movies in almost thirty years.One year later, a mysterious killer with a mask of the first Plymouth, Massachusettes Governor, John Carver, shows up with a sinister plan, targeting those responsible for the tragedy. The high school kids who sneak in through the employee entrance, Jessica (Nell Verlaque), Gabby (Addison Rae), Yulia (Jenna Warren) and Scuba (Gabriel Davenport,) provoke the mob. The owner, Thomas Wright (Rick Hoffman,) washes his hands while his wife, Kathleen (Karen Cliche,) doesn't do much else. The mob's heinous acts are caught on security camera footage that is suddenly deleted. Who could have done that?Jessica, Thomas's daughter, starts piecing together what is going on when they all start receiving cryptic Instagram posts involving a table that has been set with all their names on it. Aside from Jessica, they all have the intelligence of a wrench and serve no other purpose than to be killed because they are arrogant, dumb teenagers who are selfish. One of the girls can't put her phone down long enough to fix the fake eyelashes.One of the friends, Evan (Tomaso Sanelli) is an arrogant, mouthpiece that is so over the top you can't wait to see him die. He's an a*****e throughout the entire movie until he is caught, gagged and starts bawling. I snicked just a little bit with a sense of happiness, but It was more pitiful than the whimpering, a few minutes later. Another one gets her ears popped with Corn Skewers, basically, everything we saw in the trailer, and it's a case of trying to find this killer with a dumb police force, led by Sheriff Eric Newlon (Patrick Dempsey) jumping from one crime scene to another for most of the movie.The scene I was referring to with a Cheerleader jumping on a trampoline in the gritty fake trailer had a knife come out from under the trampoline while she does the splits, and you can figure out the rest. In this movie, the scene is so misplaced, for one thing, it feels like it was just thrown in. Someone dies in the high school while the cops stand around outside, and John Carver attacks inside.A muscle dummy sees his girlfriend in the window in a blue cheerleader outfit, and he follows her to the gym, which is pitch black. He sits on the floor, and she saunters over and turns the light on as if Roth is hinting, ""You remember that part in the fake trailer, oh my, here it is."" She bounces on the trampoline and, she falls and gets stabbed three times. It's not even a gory kill or anything, just stabbed, and I don't even think the cops investigate her death, so It's on to who dies next.John Carver is the most interesting aspect of the movie as a killer, not who the identity is, which will keep you guessing. The mystery of the killer's sinister plan begs the question because, as a vengeful killer in a mask, it makes sense, but when you see out who the killer is, It's dumb and the motive, which I figured out at the beginning of the movie is predictable. I figured out who the killer was about 5 minutes before it was revealed.It feels like Eli Roth is cheering for the killer, and the audience should be too, which I was. The revelation as to why everything is happening is to be expected for a slasher film, in an atypical fashion, but every time John Carver showed up, I found a little bit of excitement because he is brutal. There is a scene involving an oven, and the fake trailer makes it look like someone is going to get stuffed. Don't count your blessings, it's 2023, but it's the last thirty mins of the movie where it gets nasty but not as nasty as Eli Roth could've made this movie.""Thanksgiving"" will please the easiest of gore hounds, but It doesn't deliver the Grindhouse fashion the trailer did Because Eli Roth waited 16 years and in 2023, horror directors are scared to show the goods. The damage scratches would've worked wonderfully but instead, it's slasher violence and no nudity, which was a surprise. ""Hobo With a Shotgun"" was Grindhouse material that didn't skimp or shy away from disgusting and I have to give director Jason Eisner credit for that movie for not holding back even if it was awful and cruel where Eli Roth doesn't live up to the fake trailer for whatever reason, he made a holiday-themed slasher with a potentially interesting killer that gets lost in the mix of a typical slasher that serves up nothing new.","promising `` white meat ... dark meat ... carved , Thanksgiving , '' director Eli Roth delivers , '' 16 years later , 's disappointing slasher n't carve well . features worst characters ever seen slasher movie dialogue sounds fed pasta maker .

Thanksgiving,"Thanksgiving begins very well with a terrific scene of catastrophe putside a home ware store on Black Friday.

Thanksgiving,"Thanksgiving is a new slasher directed by Eli Roth and set around the holiday of thanksgiving. It started life as a fake trailer in between Roths and Tarantinos grindhouse double feature (Roths best work).Before I even talk about the story, I've been hearing a lot of people asking why there aren't more horror films that take place over this holiday. Surely that answer is simple, it's a Holliday that's mainly only celebrated by Americans and Canadians and so straight away that lessens the films appeal. So for those that don't know thanksgiving takes place at the end of November and is a chance for those who celebrate to pig out on a glorified roast dinner and get hammered with their friends and family whilst forgetting that their country's economy's in the toilet and half the worlds at world but I digress.The first 20 minuets were for me the most original and best part of this film. It takes place on Black Friday and we see the stress that retail workers have to go through to prepare for such an event. This is then followed by hoards of people almost like zombies basically ram-raiding the shop to get 'great deals' on products the shop likely had been trying to get rid of unsuccessfully up to this point. As a result of this carnage several people die and then at the same time the following year someone is out to get revenge on the people they perceive as being responsible but who is this mysterious killer?After the first 20 minuets or so the film basically becomes scream, it's a group of survivors of the Black Friday riot trying to stay alive whilst working out who this killer is. As the audience I felt we were given very few clues throughout as to who it may be and I instead felt the film focused too much on pointing fingers at certain characters to try and distract the us. This resulted in me not really having even a clue as to who the killer might be by the end and when they were eventually revealed I felt their motive to commit such horrific murders was a bit pants.The kills themselves were at the very least always creative however I did feel the gorier the death, the more cheap and unrealistic it looked. I will however say there is one kill towards the end that will stick with me purely for its ingenuity.Personally, I'm not the biggest Eli Roth fan I think his films feel quite cheap and whilst I get that he's going for that 80's B movie nostalgia it doesn't always work for me.With that being said it is one of his better films although if I'm going to watch a slasher I'm still going to stick with the likes of Scream, Halloween or Child's Play.","Thanksgiving new slasher directed Eli Roth set around holiday thanksgiving . started life fake trailer Roths Tarantinos grindhouse double feature ( Roths best work ) .Before even talk story , 've hearing lot people asking n't horror films take place holiday .

Thanksgiving,"People who rated this at a 7/10 owe me 9 euros for the purchased cinema ticket. This is the worst 'horror' film I have ever seen in a cinema!The 'Black Friday' opening scene is slapstick, which can't be taken seriously at all.Then the entire film turns out to be based on the ridiculous events in that scene. It feels strange that after the openingsscene that could have been part the scary movie franchise, much weight is put on that scene.The humor in the film is just lame and out of place. But also the story makes no sense. Weird and often too long dialogues are going nowhere at all. The acting is deplorable, the kills are over the top and with little impact or originality. Where movies like Terrifier and Scream are able to successfully mix comedy with horror and over the top kills, 'Thanksgiving' really misses the mark on all fronts. This film might have been suitable at an indy film festival for people who enjoy very bad movies, but based on the ratings I assumed this was a good film. Shame.","People rated 7/10 owe 9 euros purchased cinema ticket . worst 'horror ' film ever seen cinema !

Thanksgiving,"""Thanksgiving"" is a serviceable horror film that touches upon all the high school horror tropes. Jocks, nerds, party kids, cheerleader, and so forth. The template is so mid that what you find yourself waiting for is the kills. The murderer isn't that hard to figure out. It's essentially the person whom you know during the Black Friday stampede is the one who is the most traumatized.Was this a social commentary on capitalism? Not in the least. It is really a commentary on horror films of the 80's and 90's.Though director Eli Roth finds gruesome ways to dispense with the annoying teens, for the most part it gets tiresome to watch the gore. And there is also very uneven smirks. Such as when the first victim is murdered, the police are going over the viscera whilst we are (I think) suppose to be laughing. It's sadism from behind the camera.The movie does give you what you want. The kills are associated with the holiday. All the victims have their heads chopped off and placed at the table. And it doesn't take long for the killer (named Carver since he wears a John Carver mask) to make quips as he kills.The motivation for the killings aren't entirely convincing. Though, much like what its being influenced by, the killed are worthy of being killed. They are obnoxious. And, and a lot of points, really find yourself cheering for the killer. Even when the final girl is fleeing, you want her to be done in as well.The Plymouth, Mass. Locale adds a really nice mood. But there are too many logistical quirks to elevate this movie to anything other than a curious look. A total matinee priced flick.","`` Thanksgiving '' serviceable horror film touches upon high school horror tropes .

Thanksgiving,"Though it's very formulaic, this film, it's still at the better end of recent gore-fests. We start off with the most unlikely of scenarios - a Thanksgiving sale at a supermarket that goes spectacularly and violently wrong. The population of the founding father's very own Plymouth in Massachusetts become frenetic and determined to do whatever it takes to get into this store and get their free waffle iron! Anyway, a group of kids manage to sneak in first and provoke the waiting crowd - that leads to a stampede with tragic results. Scoot on twelve months and the same store is proposing to have anther such sale, despite the fatalities last time round that led to no prosecutions thanks to some security camera ""errors"". Sheriff ""Eric"" (Patrick Dempsey) is concerned for public safety but that's just the start of his woes. When the rather odious and foul mouthed waitress ""Lizzie"" (Amanda Barker) is found - well half of her is found - stuck to the store's illuminated signage, he must find the culprit before there are even more revenge attacks by the masked pilgrim... Yes, we've seen this all before but here Eli Roth takes a cast that might have been graduates from Ben Platt's ""Theater Camp"" (2023) and turns them into prey for a menacing killer who certainly has some imagination when reeking his havoc on those who did him wrong. It takes a swipe at the commercial culture around this American holiday - rather well presented via Rick Hoffman's store-owning ""Thomas"", father or our lead ""Jessica"" (Nell Verlaque) and husband to the really rather shallow ""Kathleen"" (Karen Cliche). There's a bit of boyfriend rivalry that accidentally displays the versatility (?!) of Milo Manheim who quite successfully ditches his butter wouldn't melt image (anyone seen ""Journey to Bethlehem""?) before a suitably far-fetched denouement that does take it's time, repeats itself a bit and concludes screaming sequel. There are some some funny moments, the cast largely gel well and though not exactly scary, there are a few effective jumps. I doubt that you'll recall it for long after, but I think this is actually quite good.","Though 's formulaic , film , 's still better end recent gore-fests . start unlikely scenarios - Thanksgiving sale supermarket goes spectacularly violently wrong . population founding father 's Plymouth Massachusetts become frenetic determined whatever takes get store get free waffle iron !

Thanksgiving,"The story was interesting with a logical villain, but it wants to have it both ways, being either a scary slasher movie and a disgusting, forced horror movie. Some of the dialog was funny, but the violence was frustrating. I couldn't tell if some of the deaths were intended to scare me or just gross me out. It seems Eli Roth intended horror, laughs and senseless deaths. I'm split on the movie because there were entertaining scenes and forced scenes and the characters were so laid back as victims.

This resulted in me not really having even a clue as to who the killer might be by the end and when they were eventually revealed I felt their motive to commit such horrific murders was a bit pants.The kills themselves were at the very least always creative however I did feel the gorier the death, the more cheap and unrealistic it looked. I will however say there is one kill towards the end that will stick with me purely for its ingenuity.Personally, I'm not the biggest Eli Roth fan I think his films feel quite cheap and whilst I get that he's going for that 80's B movie nostalgia it doesn't always work for me.With that being said it is one of his better films although if I'm going to watch a slasher I'm still going to stick with the likes of Scream, Halloween or Child's Play.","Thanksgiving new slasher directed Eli Roth set around holiday thanksgiving . started life fake trailer Roths Tarantinos grindhouse double feature ( Roths best work ) .Before even talk story , 've hearing lot people asking n't horror films take place holiday .

Thanksgiving,"People who rated this at a 7/10 owe me 9 euros for the purchased cinema ticket. This is the worst 'horror' film I have ever seen in a cinema!The 'Black Friday' opening scene is slapstick, which can't be taken seriously at all.Then the entire film turns out to be based on the ridiculous events in that scene. It feels strange that after the openingsscene that could have been part the scary movie franchise, much weight is put on that scene.The humor in the film is just lame and out of place. But also the story makes no sense. Weird and often too long dialogues are going nowhere at all. The acting is deplorable, the kills are over the top and with little impact or originality. Where movies like Terrifier and Scream are able to successfully mix comedy with horror and over the top kills, 'Thanksgiving' really misses the mark on all fronts. This film might have been suitable at an indy film festival for people who enjoy very bad movies, but based on the ratings I assumed this was a good film. Shame.","People rated 7/10 owe 9 euros purchased cinema ticket . worst 'horror ' film ever seen cinema !

Thanksgiving,"I live in Canada and thanksgiving here is not only in a different month than the US, it seems to be a less... feral tradition overall lol. We don't have the looming obscenity of that Black Friday nonsense hovering around the same weekend and the overall custom is just... not as psychotic. Eli Roth fully embraces that American version of the holiday in his bonkers seasonal slasher Thanksgiving, a fleshed out (literally) expansion on the faux trailer that Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez commissioned him to do for their Midnite double feature GrindHouse. The result is lots of fun and definitely Roth's best work so far as a filmmaker. Fun really is the key word here and it's what seems to have been missing from his work in horror overall so far, with the exception of Cabin Fever, his second best film. In dour, unpleasant failures like Hostel, Green Inferno and the deplorable Knock Knock he just seemed to be coming from a place of malcontent. Thanksgiving is a party though, as any slasher set around a holiday should be, and it not only satirically skewers the rabid consumerism of Black Friday in a shocking opening sequence, but also pokes subtle fun at the woke millennial sentiment around whining and cancelling Thanksgiving itself these days. The gory mayhem is off the rails here, some of the downright outrageous moments from the fake trailer make it into the feature intact and Roth assembles a fine cast including Gina Gershon (sadly, very briefly), Rick Hoffman, Addison Rae and angelic, scene stealing Final Girl Nell Verlaque. I still maintain that Roth should have kept Michael Biehn in the sheriff's role he casted him in for the faux trailer to preserve the horror aura, instead of picking the Grey's Anatomy dude instead but I can see how that guy could be more bankable to the superficial filmgoing demographic aimed at filling the seats. In any case though it's a great horror flick, the killer is genuinely creepy at times, suspense is orchestrated very well, there a a few incredibly effective jump scares that are truly unpredictable moments and the kills.... well they are something else, a grisly parade of well thought out murders that frequently push the boundaries of shock and awe. Tons of fun.","live Canada thanksgiving different month US , seems less ... feral tradition overall lol . n't looming obscenity Black Friday nonsense hovering around weekend overall custom ... psychotic .

Thanksgiving,"Thanksgiving is a stupid movie, and not a particularly well-crafted one if you want to look at how it's presented, how it's written, and how it's acted... but there's a good deal of fun to be had here. It took a little while to get going, but fitting to the holiday it's named after, you feel stuffed by the end of it. Once things kick off, there's a constant amount of violence, chaos, and mystery, and though it feels like there are too many characters at first, it does help the whole whodunnit aspect of the film.I liked this as a mystery film, and for an over-the-top/sometimes darkly comedic one (very, very stupid comedy for the most part, but the more ridiculous scenes are fun). However, Thanksgiving did little for me as a horror film. I was expecting it to be a little scarier than it was, and it feels limited when it comes to being frightening. There are some intense moments here and there, but many of the scares end up feeling repetitive.Still, the idea of a horror movie about Thanksgiving is so stupid that it working at all is worth commending, and it's possible it's more self-aware about being kind of a joke than I'm giving it credit for. I just found the horror stuff a bit whatever, but Thanksgiving ends up wading into various other subgenres with more success.I'd be willing to see Eli Roth go even further into making a full-throttle - perhaps even sillier - horror comedy, because this feels like a step in the right direction compared to other films of his like Hostel and The Green Inferno (the only other movies of his I've seen - Thanksgiving is much, much better than either, in my opinion).","Thanksgiving stupid movie , particularly well-crafted one want look 's presented , 's written , 's acted ...

Thanksgiving,"Halloween season is over and normally i keep my horror for that period, but having heard how good this movie was and that it was still in theatre, i wanted to support it.Being a Quebec Canadian, we don't really celebrate thanksgiving here, even tough we have a Canadian version that is close to the USA one, but im always up for a good slasher.This movie is basically Scream meet Halloween Kills. It has you guessing on who is the killer but also has a pretty high and creative bodycount. Thats the part i apreciated the most. The blood and gore is well done and the guessing game is solid.That said it is not without a few minor flaws. Personally i couldn't really care much about the characters. They are all very shallow and uninteresting. You never spent much time with them exept the main girl and altough everyone is in a couple, you never get much intimacy moments with them to make you care much. But i guess thats the price for having a big bodycount so its a balance, it really depend on what you prefer. Ill admit i usually watch a slasher more for the kills than character developement so it didn't bothered me that much.There is also a few ""characters"" that are there stickly to make the bodycount rise and you barely get anything else with them.A part i didn't like as much tough is the ""Final Destination inspiration"". Some situations are VERY stretching it when it comes to ""suspend your disbelief"", including in the introduction. I know being stomp is a real thing and freak accidents CAN happen, but that was pushing it a lot. Some of them really had no purpose once again beside giving us more blood and gore. And there is a few parts where i felt these humans were made out of marshmellow. Human bones do not break ""THAT easy"". But again its a minor flaw for me.Apparently the movie didn't do crazy numbers in theatre but everybody seem to love it (myself included) so i wouldn't be surprise it make a lot more money with its VOD/Bluray release and this could very well become a franchise. Maybe then i could get a little more interested in some of those characters if we spend more times with them.Overall a solid slasher flick thats a welcome addition to any horror fan collection.","Halloween season normally keep horror period , heard good movie still theatre , wanted support it.Being Quebec Canadian , n't really celebrate thanksgiving , even tough Canadian version close USA one , im always good slasher.This movie basically Scream meet Halloween Kills . guessing killer also pretty high creative bodycount .

Thanksgiving,"There are so many holiday themed scary movies mostly centered around Christmas and Halloween but now we finally have Thanksgiving, a horror flick directed by horror movie legend Eli Roth. Die-hard fans of the genre may know that Thanksgiving is based off the mock trailer in Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's double feature Grindhouse which Eli Roth was also attached too.Thanksgiving, the movie not the holiday, is about a serial killer attacking people from the town of Plymouth Massachusetts a year after a tragic Thanksgiving/Black Friday event. Although the Grindhouse film was campy from beginning to end, Thanksgiving felt like a more serious movie with campy aspects to it. However, the execution of that concept doesn't always work. There was a more ""grounded"" tone when it came to mystery of who the killer might be and his motives but it was always undercut by the absolutely dumb decisions made by the most unlikeable cast of characters one of which played by TikTok star Addison Rae for some reason.Eli Roth movies are known for their over the top violence and this movie is no exception. There are quite a few slow moments but Slasher fans will be happy when the killer does his thing because he gets the job done in some creatively disturbing ways.The writing is the weakest part of the film. For example I think Eli Roth made the characters here extremely unlikeable on purpose which would've been a great idea if he didn't try to spend a good part of the movie making audiences care for teens by the end.Eli Roth has worked with many horror movie connoisseurs so its unfortunate Thanksgiving falls into so many generic tropes including many leaps in logic when it comes to the killer getting to his victims. On top of that time the killer's reveal and motivation made the ending feel pretty anticlimactic.Despite Thanksgiving's shortcomings, it's an enjoyable slasher movie. Eli Roth knows how to deliver on the gore, suspense and camp at times but the film as a whole left a lot to be desired.","many holiday themed scary movies mostly centered around Christmas Halloween finally Thanksgiving , horror flick directed horror movie legend Eli Roth .

Thanksgiving,"Why in the world would you take a parody of 70s/80s slashers and make it into a straightforward, unironic horror flick? Why??!? The 2007 fake trailer for ""Grindhouse"" was everything this feature version is not: fun, funny and witty. Sure, there are some, er, humorous moments in ""Thanksgiving"", but too often the film feels like a forthright (and uninspired at that) splatter film - more ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" than ""Scream"". The characters, including the final girl (but with the notable exception of the arms dealer dude) are dull. The plot is predictable (it took me 20 mn to guess who the killer was and little more to know how he would be dispatched) and often includes far-fetched or impossible twists. The death scenes are not particularly exciting and confuse gory with fun. At no point do you get the feeling that this movie is winking at you knowingly, concealing its satirical nature behind a pose. If Roth's intention was to make a camp and self-aware film this is a total failure - unless it was all too subtle for me, which I grant you is a possibility. When the killer exclaims, ""And this time there will be no leftovers!"", it just comes across as a cheesy line, not as a campy reference to b-grade movies.What the filmmakers have accomplished here is make an exploitation film that takes all the kitschy fun out of exploitation flicks and only keeps the tedium.

Thanksgiving,"Pretty much your typical horror movie that you get these days. The focus isn't really on the scares but more so on how gross the movie can get and this one gets pretty gross. I guess it's supposed to make you laugh also, I found myself laughing at some of the kills because they were so ridiculous. Especially in the opening scene. There were some things I was hoping to see make it into this movie that were in the Grindhouse trailer but unfortunately they didn't.Towards the end everything starts moving fast. I wish the dinner table scene would have lasted a little longer but it's like the director seen he only had 15 mins. Left and sped through everything. The reveal was lackluster, and the killer was a little lackluster. The conflict is resolved to quick (or not at all). Some of the characters that were prevalent throughout the movie just pop back up at the end. And the very last scene wasn't needed and then a quick cut to the credits.I enjoyed the movie besides how quickly everything got wrapped up towards the end.","Pretty much typical horror movie get days . focus n't really scares gross movie get one gets pretty gross . guess 's supposed make laugh also , found laughing kills ridiculous .

Thanksgiving,"This is based on a short fictitious trailer by Eli Roth from the film Grindhouse (2007), a trailer I thought would have been interesting to see a full horror movie on it, since there are other fictitious trailers from Grindhouse (2007) that have been turned into full movies, like the movie Machete (2010). Now we have a Thanksgiving slasher movie that is designed to be watched during the holiday; the movie slasher movie Thanksgiving (2023) is a fun, gory, and entertaining slasher movie that is not perfect, but the movie has a fitting killer and message that involves how people act during the holiday. Also, the movie shows how consumerism from Black Friday at a store affects people to distract them from what the holiday is about, leading to a big situation in the movie.The movie focuses of these people after an intense Black Friday at one of the town's well-known stores, and the performances are not that bad; the teenagers getting attacked by the killer were not involved in the Black Friday incident, so you can at least care for them, but also there are people who were involved that deserved to be attacked by the killer because of what they did on that day. There are some characters that could be annoying, and some of the dialogue could have been better; these characters are not meant to be memorable, because this movie does follow horror movie slasher tropes, but they are done well where the tropes are not annoying to watch.I liked the killer of the movie with how he looks, and how he kills people with traditional Thanksgiving items or in interesting brutal ways just by hitting them with an axe; he does a lot of Thanksgiving related things and there are a lot of brutal bloody kills that horror fans will like. The reveal of the killer was not bad, and it made sense why the person was killing people, along with the movie having some suspenseful moments, and scenes that replicate moments in the trailer the movie is based on. There were moments that did not make sense, or characters who do not appear until a certain point like they teleported around, something like that happens in the third act.Thanksgiving (2023) is not a perfect horror movie, but it is a fun horror movie that I would recommend watching on Thanksgiving, especially if you are a horror fan; the kills are brutal, the Thanksgiving theme is well done, the characters are not bad, and the killer is cool and fits the theme of the movie. The movie has its issues with some dialogue, some characters, and some of the execution of scenes; but other than that, I will watch this movie again next Thanksgiving as my go to movie to watch during the holiday.","based short fictitious trailer Eli Roth film Grindhouse ( 2007 ) , trailer thought would interesting see full horror movie , since fictitious trailers Grindhouse ( 2007 ) turned full movies , like movie Machete ( 2010 ) .

Thanksgiving,"""Thanksgiving"" is a horror and comedy film directed by Roth and Jeff Rendell, starring Jeff Rendell. The film follows a Black Friday sale with a high body count, showcasing Roth's expert timing for shock and laugh-out-loud awe. The film highlights the tension and brutality of the situation, as a mob bursts into a Right Mart store, requiring rations for the apocalypse. The film highlights the ""black"" in ""Black Friday"" as blood splatters and people die for free waffle irons. A year later, a killer with the mask of first Plymouth, Massachusetts governor John Carver terrorizes the town, targeting high schoolers, the owner, and customers who were part of the tragedy. The local sheriff investigates the murders, but Jessica, the store owner's daughter, starts piecing together the events while receiving cryptic Instagram notifications and images of a table set. Some suspects include her boyfriend Bobby, who vanished after a Black Friday sale, and Ryan, who swooped in on Jessica after Bobby left. The story explores themes of identity, revenge, and the consequences of a tragic event. Despite an R rating, Roth has held fast to the demented playfulness of classic exploitation in a stick-to-your-ribs feast of ascended schlock. He serves up prime-certified laughs and mutilations, no fillers or additives, and delivers prime-certified laughs and mutilations without fillers or additives.""Thanksgiving"" is a well-crafted slasher film with a single jump scare, thanks to Roth's focus on timing and impressive kills. The film's steady flow of horror and comedy adds to its suspense, but it can be too sadistic in the last third, potentially pacing. The director's support for the killer is evident in the film, which is scattered and delivers its reveal in a clunky manner. The film's survival game is a satisfying experience for viewers. Eli Roth has been a pioneer in blending low-rent genres into mainstream cinema, such as splatter horror, erotic thrillers, and mondo films. Roth directed a short for a Z-grade slasher that loosed a killer in a pilgrim get-up on Plymouth to slice up their annual Turkey Day parade. In his gorefest Thanksgiving, Eli Roth's new horror film, Thanksgiving, features a leering POV of a killer plotting his next home invasion. The opening shot is a fake out, paying tribute to the voyeuristic beginnings of Halloween and Black Christmas. Roth's flamboyantly gross, tongue-in-cheek addition to the holiday-horror calendar is somewhere between homage and parody. His first attempt at this premise was a mock trailer for Grindhouse, which was a spoof of the slasher programmers of the early '80s. Sixteen years later, Thanksgiving is a real movie, with Roth ditching the retro, grainy, damaged-print gimmick. His new Thanksgiving is like a remake of the imaginary '80s version, upgraded for the age of smartphones and Scream-inspired slasher whodunits, but with the sick-puppy sense of humor left intact. In Plymouth, Massachusetts, a Black Friday promotion leads to a stampede, resulting in casualties. A year later, a killer in pilgrim attire and a plastic John Carver mask begins to wreak havoc across town, targeting rioters, store owners, and teenage girls. A cop, played by Patrick Dempsey, is hunting the killer. The violence in Thanksgiving is both ridiculous and brutal, balancing memorability and inventiveness without becoming truly unpleasant. The film's director, Roth, has adapted his sadism from the cartoon inconsequiality of slasher cinema, making even the most ghoulish moments closer to shock comedy than horror. The film feels indebted to the infamous Terrifier movies, with a villain who occasionally trades out his pilgrim theme for a pistol and clown getup. The film's violence is both ridiculous and brutal, with mileage varying according to sensibility, sensitivity, and gag reflex.","`` Thanksgiving '' horror comedy film directed Roth Jeff Rendell , starring Jeff Rendell . film follows Black Friday sale high body count , showcasing Roth 's expert timing shock laugh-out-loud awe . film highlights tension brutality situation , mob bursts Right Mart store , requiring rations apocalypse . film highlights `` black '' `` Black Friday '' blood splatters people die free waffle irons . year later , killer mask first Plymouth , Massachusetts governor John Carver terrorizes town , targeting high schoolers , owner , customers part tragedy . local sheriff investigates murders , Jessica , store owner 's daughter , starts piecing together events receiving cryptic Instagram notifications images table set . suspects include boyfriend Bobby , vanished Black Friday sale , Ryan , swooped Jessica Bobby left . story explores themes identity , revenge , consequences tragic event .

Thanksgiving,"Who ever thought that, of all the active directors in the world, none other than Eli Roth would be the one responsible for the best (arguably) and most entertaining (definitely) horror movie of the year 2023? Despite several long-awaited and acclaimed sequels/remakes (""The Exorcist: Believer"", ""Evil Dead Rise"", ""Saw X"", ...) and curious experiments (""Five Nights at Freddy's, ""Renfield"", ""Cocaine Bear"", ...) it is Roth who triumphs with an old-fashioned but blood-soaked and delightfully tongue-in-cheek throwback to the glorious era of 80s slashers.The history of ""Thanksgiving"" began in 2007, when Roth put together a gritty two-minute fake trailer as part of Quentin Tarantino's and Robert Rodriguez' ""Grindhouse"" film-project. It was a quick and dirty little assignment on the side, but nevertheless fantastically handled by Eli Roth. His trailer genuinely looked and felt like an early 80s relic, because he cleverly cashed in on the contemporary popular trend of holiday-themed horrors (""Halloween"", ""Happy Birthday to Me"", ""My Bloody Valentine"", ""Graduation Day"", ...) and he stuffed it - like a Thanksgiving turkey - with gore, imaginative kills, sleaze, dumb teenagers, and hysterical shrieks.Now, it's one thing to create a fun trailer for a movie that never existed, but making a compelling and entertaining full-length out of it is something else entirely. And yet, Roth did practically everything right. He didn't try to turn ""Thanksgiving"" into another 80s period piece but brought the action to present day Massachusetts and incorporated typically irritating 2020s hypes like Black Friday shopping madness and the live streaming of other people's misery for the sake of likes.Simply put, ""Thanksgiving"" revolves around a strong and merciless killer who, disguised as an original pilgrim and armed with an axe, goes after the people responsible for a tragedy that occurred in a shopping mall one year before on Black Friday and resulted in the death of three people. The killer, referred to as John Carver, does not only target the irresponsible manager of the shopping complex, but also the obnoxious teens and greedy people who were ready to trample others to be the first to get a free waffle maker! In good old slasher tradition, there are numerous suspects for who might be the killer, and just as many subtle hints/clues for the attentive viewer to guess along for his/her identity. The key words in ""Thanksgiving"" are: fun, gore, tribute, and absurd. The first three are self-explanatory, and I'm adding ""absurd"" because you truly haven't lived until you witness a grown woman getting baked and served like a (tasty looking) Thanksgiving dinner!","ever thought , active directors world , none Eli Roth would one responsible best ( arguably ) entertaining ( definitely ) horror movie year 2023 ?

D._tv.This is a horror slasher film that is written & directed by Eli Roth and is based on a fake trailer he did back in the 2007 movie, Grindhouse. This film takes place in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the birthplace of Thanksgiving. One year after a Black Friday goes bad-people pushing and shoving and people actually getting killed-a Thanksgiving inspired killer starts killing people using Thanksgiving inspired utensils as weapons. He even dresses like a Pilgrim and wears a John Carver mask-if you don't know him, look him up. Some of the killers' weapons of choice are corn on the cob corn holders, a carving knife, an ax, a meat tenderizer and one victim's whole body is even placed in a huge oven-sprinkled with salt, pepper and herbs, of course-and cooked and then placed on a table. This is NOT your Charlie Brown's Thanksgiving movie. Patrick plays the sheriff, Rick is the store owner, Nell is Rick's daughter and Milo is Nell's boyfriend. Lots of people are likely suspects for being the killer-one person even says, Don't trust anyone! If you stay until after the end credits, there is a blooper shown.It's rated R for bloody violence, gore, language and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.If you like these types of movies, it's a good one. I would buy it on Blu_Ray.","saw Thanksgiving , starring Patrick Dempsey-Grey 's Anatomy_tv , Meatballs 3 : Summer Job ; Rick Hoffman-Suits_tv , Hostel ; Nell Verlaque-Big Shot_tv , Marijuana Conspiracy Milo Manheim-School Spirits_tv , Doogie Kamealoha , M.

Thanksgiving,"What's the point of this film, to gross out the audience or give them nightmares. These ""slasher"" films to me border on sadist perversion. How can one be entertained by brutal and vicious murders. This whole mess has me scratching my head.

Thanksgiving,"The only slightly amusing part was the revelation of the killer. The acting was terrible IMO, After Yulia was killed, Jess delivered the most monotonic speech, as if she was reading something from a newspaper.

Thanksgiving,"I'm a little stunned by the positivity of the reviews I've seen. Thanksgiving has some good surrounded by mostly bad. I'll start with the few positives. It's mostly well-made from a technical perspective. I loved the scenes of carnage and chaos. And all of the kills made my jaw drop. It doesn't hold back.Everything outside of the kill scenes is bad. I wish they leaned more into the dark fun slasher vibes. Instead they try to be serious, which magnifies how bad, bland and dumb the rest of the movie is. And while the mystery is intriguing and unpredictable, the reveal is barely satisfying.This will probably be more enjoyable if you haven't seen many movies.

Thanksgiving,"I wanted to watch and enjoy the movie but it's just way to violent and way too much gore for no reason. I was aware of this going in since it's what the director does but hoped it wouldn't be that bad. Turned it off midday into the riot, maybe 10mins of the movie, just too brutal and I really don't see the need.

Thanksgiving,"This is Eli Roth at his best. The kills are over the top, the build up to the mystery led to surprises, and it touched on the commentary on commercialism and its effects on the town. The jokes don't always hit the roof, but as a nod to 80s and 90s horror, this is how a horror movie should be. It seems to tease a potential sequel, but for now this long awaited feature is worth additional viewings. Another fake trailer is now a movie, leaving only two more to go for a full set.

Thanksgiving,I was quite surprised yet happy to see a thanksgiving horror film getting such high praise. I went in with no expectations and only saw the trailer possibly once. Let me start by saying that this film has quite graphic kills and inventive kills at that. This film starts solid with an extremely dramatic opening and then follows the basic slasher whodunnit outline. I didn't find any of the characters interesting nor do I remember a single person's name so it was kinda hard to stay invested when I don't have a connection to anyone.After the killer is revealed the movie then rushes to the end. Not sure if the director wanted to keep the run time short or if they just didn't know how to end the film but it literally sprints to the end. If you're looking for a cheesy horror movie and just watching for fun this is for you. I just need a little more substance.,quite surprised yet happy see thanksgiving horror film getting high praise . went expectations saw trailer possibly .

Thanksgiving,"I walked in with no expectations of this move and was extremely disappointed. It started off on a good note and the gore was probably the only good thing about this movie. Throughout the entire movie you're expecting there to be two killers and towards the end you know there has to be since the killer is in two places at once. Yet, you'd be wrong. Somehow the killer can magically transport and the character who was framed(who also happened to be wearing the killer outfit), wasn't. Apparently the framed character just wanted to wear the killers outfit and then turned around to be the hero? No explanation there. The story was lackluster to say the least and besides the bad acting, it was just a waste of time.","walked expectations move extremely disappointed . started good note gore probably good thing movie .

Thanksgiving,"Eli Roth is the last person I would have thought would have watered down the transgressions in a film so highly anticipated, especially after such a transgressive and popular fake trailer.Overall, the film is not bad by any means, but it misses the mark of what it is truly derived from.The 2007 grindhouse thanksgiving trailer was a grainy, ""video nasty"" inspired piece of media that truly captured the essence of what made the 1980's slashers so exciting and unique.This version of thanksgiving is much more aligned with a modern scream sequel than an original slasher flick, both in tone and content.Some examples include; the trampoline scene, which in the grindhouse trailer was far more risqué and spirited rather than then washed out version we got in thanksgiving; the lack of sexuality in the film in general which was a staple in classic slasher flicks; the lack of a gritty feel to it, for example, see a film like Terrifier 2, very gritty and gory in a classic slasher kind of way, this film is missing that 80's grain and feel to it and feels too much like a 2000's remake that watered down the sex and brutality that is so representative of this genre.Another example of a missing scene is the ""bj"" decapitation from the original trailer; this scene was iconic as it demonstrated the type of sexualized violence that was classic for 1980's slashers, completely removed from the full length feature!Overall, I believe that unfortunately this movie is a sign of the times and is likely a product of today's society which has seemingly entered another moral panic (albeit for very different reasons than in the past).Oh, what could have been had Eli Roth made thanksgiving as it was originally intended!

Thanksgiving,"Like Machete and Hobo with a Shotgun before, I found out this scary movie was based on a mock trailer from Grindhouse (aka Planet Death/Death Proof combined), I heard positive things about it, and I liked the tagline ""There will be no leftovers"", I was looking forward to it, directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever, Hostel, Death Wish). Basically, during Thanksgiving 2022 in Plymouth, Massachusetts (the town that settlers, or Pilgrims, first celebrated in 1621), people have gathered outside the RightMart superstore ready for the Black Friday sales. Thomas Wright (Rick Hoffman) is the owner of the store, and his daughter Jessica (Nell Verlaque) lets her boyfriend Bobby (Jalen Thomas Brooks) and her friends Evan (Tomaso Sanelli), Gabby (Addison Rae), Scuba (Gabriel Davenport), and Yulia (Jenna Warren) inside early through a side door. The crowd outside sees them, including some goading, but Eric Newlon (Patrick Dempsey) and the security are unable to hold them back. A riot begins as the crowd pushes over the barricade, breaks down the door and stampedes into the store. Whilst the frenzied shoppers grab waffle irons and various cheap goods, the chaos sees people fighting each other and severely wounded, all of which is caught on CCTV and social media. The resulting violence sees Bobby getting his arm broken trying to save someone, and several people are killed, including Amanda Collins (Gina Gershon), the wife of store manager Mitch Collins (Ty Olsson); she is hit by a shopping trolley and her scalp is torn off by the wheel. One year later, despite the protests of Mitch and several townspeople, RightMart is preparing for another Black Friday sale. Meanwhile, Jessica and her friends have been tagged in a social media post, a photo of a Thanksgiving table with their names around it. Local diner waitress Lizzie (Amanda Barker) is attacked by a figure dressed in black clothing wearing a John Carver mask and buckle hat. Lizzie is killed trying to get into a dumpster when she is split in half, and the bottom half of her body is planted on the store sign beside a 50% off banner. Jessica and her friend become concerned when they hear police have discovered that Lizzie was present at the Black Friday riot. Meanwhile, Bobby, who lost his sports career following his injury and broke up with Jessica, has returned to Plymouth to work for his uncle, which irritates Jessica's current boyfriend Ryan (Milo Manheim). ""John Carver"" next targets security guard Manny (Tim Dillon), attacking him with an electric carving knife and decapitating him with a wire. The killer takes Manny's head and places it at the table, alongside Lizzie's dead top half. After connecting these victims to the Black Friday massacre a year ago, the police believe The Carver is targeting those involved in the riot. High school students Amy (Shailyn Griffin) and Lonnie (Mika Amonsen) are next to be killed. Lonnie's neck is broken, with his head twisted right around, and Amy jumping on a trampoline is stabbed several times from underneath. Evan and Gabby are soon abducted by John Carver, while Jessica narrowly avoids the killer attacking with an axe. Fearing the police cannot protect them, Scuba takes Jessica to meet drug dealer and gun nut McCarty (Joe Delfin) to get some weapons. Yulia's father has decided to move their family to Florida, but he and the police deputy guarding them are attacked by The Carver. Jessica and Scuba driving to Yulia's house receive a video call of the killer attacking Yulia. They arrive at the house and find Julia being held at knifepoint, and the killer holds a mobile screening footage of Evan and Gabby tied up at the dinner table. Scuba forgets to take the safety off his gun, allowing the killer to activate a buzzsaw which disembowels Yulia before he escapes. The police are concerned that the killer may strike at the upcoming Thanksgiving parade, but Jessica convinces them that it is the only chance to lure Carver out, by having the Wright family and Scuba participate in it. The parade goes ahead, with some spectators wearing John Carver masks. Eventually, the killer reveals himself, wearing an evil clown mask and decapitating a turkey mascot with an axe. Several smoke bombs are thrown into the crowd, causing a truck, holding a boat, to crash and the boat's mast to impale the driver's head. Jessica, Scuba and Thomas try to escape the mayhem but are knocked out by tranquiliser darts and driven away by the killer. The Carver prepares a Thanksgiving dinner, including Jessica's stepmother Kathleen (Karen Cliche) who has been abducted, he bastes her with fat and seasons her with salt and pepper. Kathleen awakens and tries to flee, but the killer impales her with a pitchfork, drags her back inside screaming, and throws her in the oven to roast to death. The police try to locate the killer's hideout and are sent a video link from an unknown phone which broadcasts the kidnapped victims at the dinner table. Tracking the phone's location, an armed unit finds the killer has tricked them, broadcasting a live video on a laptop screen. The Wrights, Scuba and Gabby wake at the dinner table, and Thomas vomits seeing the corpse of his wife decapitated and served on the table like a roasted turkey. The Carver speaks to the group with a microphone altering his voice (Adam MacDonald) and drills a hole through a dead Yulia's neck to drain her blood to serve in a glass. The killer then livestreams Evan, who filmed the Black Friday riot a year ago, and bludgeons him to death with a meat tenderiser. While the Carver talks about his motives, mentioning their greed and the death during the Black Friday massacre, Jessica removes a ring with a miniature knife given by McCarty, uses it to cut her bindings, and passes it to Scuba. The killer slices part of Kathleen's leg to serve to Thomas, but Scuba breaks free, and he and Jessica flee. Scuba is knocked unconscious, but Jessica escapes the hideout, the mock Pilgrim village house, climbs a fence covered in brambles and reaches the woods. She makes it to the warehouse containing the parade floats and props and finds Newlon unconscious on the ground. She follows a figure wearing the Carver's mask inside and sees it is Bobby. She calls Newlon to help capture Bobby, a gunshot is heard, but Bobby escapes. The police soon arrive and inform them that the survivors are safe. Jessica and Newlon are left alone, and she notices the debris of brambles from the fence on Newlon's trousers and shoes, deducing he is John Carver. Newlon reveals that his wife left him, Amanda helped get him back together and they had an affair, and she was pregnant with his child when she died in the massacre, this was his motive for revenge. To Newlon's horror, it's revealed that Jessica has livestreamed his confession. Newlon tries to kill her, but Bobby appears and helps her; Jessica opens a gas canister that inflates a turkey parade balloon. Bobby and Jessica try to escape in a tow truck belonging to Bobby's uncle, but Newlon hooks it to a support beam. As Newlon approaches with an axe, Jessica fires a musket into the turkey balloon, causing a gas explosion that engulfs Newlon in flames. The following morning, Bobby is taken away in an ambulance and Jessica reunites with Gabby, Ryan, Scuba and McCarty. The authorities are unable to find Newlon's remains, they assume he was incinerated in the explosion. However, Jessica has various nightmares of a flaming Newlon attacking her, suggesting he may return. Also starring Russell Yuen as Detective Peter Chu, Derek McGrath as Mayor Cantin, and Jeff Teravainen as Deputy Bret Labelle. Dempsey (who starred in Scream 3) is good as the sheriff, and Verlaque is adequate as the leading teenager, it works just like Scream as a masked Pilgrim killer whodunnit, and the various holiday tradition references are weaved in well, but the absolute crown of the turkey is the death sequences. It is deliciously gory, with many laughably over-the-top mutilations to feast your eyes on, you will squirm and smirk in equal measure with its playful tongue-in-cheek violence with all the trimmings, it is actually tense as well, it is a brilliant campy splatter-fest to be thankful for, a great fun slasher horror.

Thanksgiving,"Maybe it wasn't for my taste, i really didn't like it. The horror movie in question left me utterly disappointed and regretful of spending my time and money on such a lackluster experience. From the opening scenes to the final credits, it failed to evoke any genuine fear or suspense, instead resorting to tired clichés and predictable jump scares.It felt like the filmmakers put more effort into creating jump scares than developing characters with depth and complexity. As a result, when the inevitable horrors befell them, I found it difficult to care about their fates, robbing the film of any emotional impact it might have had. The plot felt disjointed, leaving gaping holes in the storyline. The characters' decisions were so irrational that it was hard to empathize with their plight. Overall, a disappointing attempt at horror that failed to send chills down my spine.","Maybe n't taste , really n't like . horror movie question left utterly disappointed regretful spending time money lackluster experience . opening scenes final credits , failed evoke genuine fear suspense , instead resorting tired clichés predictable jump scares.It felt like filmmakers put effort creating jump scares developing characters depth complexity . result , inevitable horrors befell , found difficult care fates , robbing film emotional impact might . plot felt disjointed , leaving gaping holes storyline . characters ' decisions irrational hard empathize plight .

Thanksgiving,"It took more than a few years, but we finally got a full length film based on the fake horror film trailer Eli Roth made for GRINDHOUSE back in 2007, titled THANKSGIVING. It was a tongue in cheek send up of holiday themed slasher films, along the lines of HALLOWEEN and BLACK CHRISTMAS, and it was just amusing enough and on point to whet the horror community's appetite. And in my opinion, the final product has been worth the wait, as Roth delivers a fun thrill ride which hits the right beats in an often disparaged and disreputable, but equally beloved, genre. As someone who has worked in retail, and had to report to work on a Thanksgiving Day more than once, I can say that I honestly related to parts of this film.The film opens in a fictional version of Plymouth, Massachusetts, on the title holiday, where families gather for dinner before rushing out to the local big box store (clearly modeled on Walmart) just after dark to be there for the early opening in order to get a jump on all those Black Friday deals. As people gather outside the store, and workers prepare for the onslaught of shoppers inside, we meet the film's protagonists: a circle of teenagers from the local high school; managers and employees; law enforcement on hand for security; and impatient locals, who are not happy being forced to wait in the parking lot. An escalating series of events leads to a riot as a mob runs rampant in the store, and in the process, several characters are trampled to death. One year later, as Thanksgiving approaches, an ominous figure, wearing the historical mask of John Carver, begins killing various sundry individuals involved in the riot in some most gruesome ways.To reveal much more would ruin the movie. What I love is the way that Roth deftly handles the tropes of the genre, including Nell Verlaque as Jessica, a most resourceful Final Girl, and a large cast of characters, played by Patrick Dempsey, Jalen Thomas Brooks, Milo Manheim, Rick Hoffman, the ever beautiful Gina Gershon, Karen Cliché, Gabriel Davenport, Tim Dillon, Addison Rae, Jenna Warren, Amanda Barker, and Tomaso Sanelli, all of whom play characters who are potential victims, or who might be the killer, because Roth does know how to create a red herring. But the biggest trope of the genre is spectacularly gory killings, and on that THANKSGIVING more than passes muster. There are decapitations, a disemboweling, skulls are crushed, and one character gets cooked alive and served up, all in a fan-pleasing over the top way. There's plenty of gore, but it never feels like nasty torture porn. There's an ample supply of humor without it ever going over the line into camp and much of it is derived from stretching more than a few broad New England stereotypes. Maybe what I found most satisfying about this film is that not one moment or one single line of dialogue is devoted to any kind of political message or agenda. This is a film out to do nothing more than entertain, and Eli Roth really knows how to steer the horror lane. I'd forgotten how satisfying a good hard R-rated horror film can be.If I was to find a fault with THANKSGIVING, it is the one other trope of the slasher genre that it fails to provide, and that is sex and nudity, which those old classics from the '80s with Freddy and Jason never failed to deliver. That is a shame, but we live in an era when showing skin and gratuitously getting it on have all but disappeared from the big screen. But as it is, this great American holiday now has its very own horror film, and fans have a new classic to watch over and over again every year.","took years , finally got full length film based fake horror film trailer Eli Roth made GRINDHOUSE back 2007 , titled THANKSGIVING . tongue cheek send holiday themed slasher films , along lines HALLOWEEN BLACK CHRISTMAS , amusing enough point whet horror community 's appetite . opinion , final product worth wait , Roth delivers fun thrill ride hits right beats often disparaged disreputable , equally beloved , genre . someone worked retail , report work Thanksgiving Day , say honestly related parts film.The film opens fictional version Plymouth , Massachusetts , title holiday , families gather dinner rushing local big box store ( clearly modeled Walmart ) dark early opening order get jump Black Friday deals . people gather outside store , workers prepare onslaught shoppers inside , meet film 's protagonists : circle teenagers local high school ; managers employees ; law enforcement hand security ; impatient locals , happy forced wait parking lot . escalating series events leads riot mob runs rampant store , process , several characters trampled death .

Thanksgiving,"Starring Patrick Dempsey, Addison Rae, and Milo Manheim, 2023's Thanksgiving is one of those movies where the genre steadily inserts itself into any day of festivity. I mean you've got Halloween for Halloween, Silent Night, Deadly Night for Christmas, April's Fool's Day for spring break, and Thanksgiving for well, Thanksgiving. Hey why not. Horror fans are always thirsty and they need their fix. Next year maybe we'll have a slasher flick about some psycho getting his kill on during Yule. Again why not.So yeah, Thanksgiving is directed by Eli Roth, a guy who wants to make you sick, to gross you out (he probably did it to his buddies via childhood). Eli came on to the scene with 2002's Cabin Fever which did all those things but also messed you up mentally. With Thanksgiving he just goes for the basics, mechanical dispatching, shrill screams, and creative offings. Sans a shocking, opening Black Friday scene, the film is borderline schlock, cartoon-like in its brutality with enough fake blood and guts to power the sun. Um, Roth is not peaking here (as he did with ""Fever""). He's almost on marginal holiday (pun intended).Mounds of corn syrup ichor and discounted price rioting aside, Thanksgiving is about a murderer named ""John Carver"" (ha ha get it?) who terrorizes a small Massachusetts town by capping its denizens in a screw-loose revenge plot (you'll see). It's all so amusing and initially fun, as Roth's TikTok, teenage characters spew lots of F-bombs before getting picked off one by one. Just think a little Scream and a little John Carpenter circa 1978 and that's what you'll get with Thanksgiving. What fails this pic is how it reveals the antagonist at the end. I mean you don't think he would do any of the actual killing, you don't think he is capable of swiftly moving from point A to B to eliminate his victims, and you don't ultimately care because everything comes off as slightly trivial.

Thanksgiving,"Plymouth, Massachusetts, was where the All-American holiday of Thanksgiving was born. But the place also seems to have created a killer meant to strike terror on an otherwise warm and memorable occasion.Bloody murder soon unravelled following a Black Friday gone wrong - more so than it usually does. Fans have gained another new slasher serial killer and he brought plenty of horror-festival cheer to the movie and the season.Classic slasher-film tropes, more than a few jump scares, and a neat storyline made ""Thanksgiving"" 2023 a genuinely amazing addition to the genre. Eli Roth has outdone himself with this one, the original screenplay for which he co-wrote with Jeff Rendell. Outstanding stunt choreo and chilling suspense added to the entertainment value of almost every scene that featured the killer. The John Carver mask reminded me of Guy Fawkes - and at times Jesus (!) - but this character was given his own raisons d'être in the 2023 movie ""Thanksgiving"".Sweet punishment took the form of John Carver, or rather a guy in a mask that evoked one of Plymouth's earliest settlers. He set the table alright, in more ways than one.A deeply uncomfortable truth in the movie was the aggression of shoppers during discount seasons. Comparing some of the shots in the movie with Black Friday photos in the news and on social media, I believe they captured the 'consumer craze' in a realistic light.There were also scenes portraying gun sales and portions in which social media 'encouraged' the sharing of violent posts. These, and other, sequences rang some interesting bells in ""Thanksgiving"".As for the 'victims', they delivered some good scream-queen and yell-king performances. But let's face it, many of them were given cookie-cutter tropes that have been done to death - in this movie, quite literally. Nevertheless, it was nice to see something old-school woven alongside something new.There were a few plot-wise similarities to 2023's ""It's A Wonderful Knife"" and ""Totally Killer"", but those stories took their own curious directions. In ""Thanksgiving"", it was more about keeping it real than indulging time-travel fantasies (which worked quite well in both ""Knife"" and ""Totally"").The idea of uncontrolled consumerism and the lack of accountability for anyone who actually died or was seriously injured during such events drove the plot of ""Thanksgiving"". A lot of it was based on real-life tragedies, which made this movie equally ironic, amusing, and unnerving.The killer thus became a vigilante seeking vengeance in the only way he knew how. The plot itself was akin to a mirror held up for society to see its own ugly reflection, and how some of our actions directly create the criminals who then return to destroy us.For a horror movie, ""Thanksgiving"" was deep in a lot of ways. This was the most surprising thing about it, and I enjoyed how Eli Roth went about delivering that message in a bloody not-too-subtle way.The inimitable Patrick Dempsey gave the killer, Sheriff Eric Newlon himself, an exceptionally captivating aura, rife with sneaky suspicions and well-guised charms. I never would've guessed he could've pulled this off as well as he did. Adam MacDonald provided the killer's voiceover in select sequences, and did admirable work with it.""Thanksgiving"" 2023 was proof that anyone with a good mask and a better motive can become a captivating slasher. Just don't go getting any ideas.","Plymouth , Massachusetts , All-American holiday Thanksgiving born . place also seems created killer meant strike terror otherwise warm memorable occasion.Bloody murder soon unravelled following Black Friday gone wrong - usually .

Thanksgiving,"Thanksgiving starts with a fantastic opening scene. The Black Friday shopping mayhem scene is straight out of South Park, with crazed shoppers rampling people to death in gruesome ways over a free waffle maker. That scene is perfectly acted, with all performers giving a spot on impression of awful greedy trash people. That scene has something to say.The rest of the film starts off as your average ""I know what you did last summer"" style revenge slasher with an unknown killer in a pilgrom costume stalking and killing the people responsible for the opening scene Black Friday tragedy.Towards the third act, the movie further devolves into needless, evil spirited torture porn.A central problem is the main characters, who are a chore to endure. All except the main girl (who seemingly has just one facial expression) and the Russian girl are awful. Especially the males. For a while I wondered if the director / writer were on a dare or pulling a prank by having every single line have the F-word in it. But then a few lines without it showed up. A pity, that would have been more clever than what we got. We are left with intensely unlikeable protagonists, waiting for them to be picked off one by one.The film barely gives us any hints to who the killer is, what in particular he's motivated by, and in the end pulls a random character out of the hat. The only reason I knew it wasn't one of the teens was that Gina Gershon had a brief appearance and death scene in the opening, so I knew the killer had to be connected to her. Otherwise why cast a name actor in a no name role?When the reveal does happen, it's ridiculously stupid, and most of all, the needless cruelty and sadism of the killer goes way beyond revenge. In particular one scene involving the centerpiece of the revenge is sickening, case in point being it's something that happened during the October 7th Hamas attack. It's so messed up that it ruins the tone of what should be a fun, scary holiday slasher / horror film. Eli Roth really needs to get his demons under control. Pushing the boundaries is one thing, but missing the tone of your movie is another.Oddly enough, the gore effects are quite bad. For a movie that goes so deep into gore, I was surprised it didn't look better.Speaking of things that look bad: the Killer's mask. This is a big one, since a slasher film lives and dies by its killer. The killer here looks boring. Like a low budget V for Vendetta, he's neither scary nor iconic. They must have realized the former, because midway during the movie, he burns his mask for no reason other than he knows he's in a movie and wants to look scarier.The film moves at a brisk pace, and thankfully the obligatory scenes of characters nervously tiptoeing through corridors with the Killer lying in wait aren't 5 minutes long like in older 80s and 90s Slashers where the narrative ground to a total halt before every kill scene. They throw in a few chase scenes to mix things up as well.Here's something I'm thankful for: Thanksgiving didn't bore me. It annoyed me with it's nasty characters, it repulsed me with the it's mean spiritedness, bit it didn't bore me.Had they kept the tone and social commentary from the opening scene, they could have had a real classic here. As it stands, this is a missed opportunity let down by a weak script and a director who's pathological need to shock undermines his talent.","Thanksgiving starts fantastic opening scene .

Those movies were named after holidays or days of the week. My favorite was the 1980 My Bloody Valentine which was a mean, nasty violent flick. That's what you expected walking in after seeing the trailer.This one reminds me of that original slasher flick from the golden age of horror. The make up effects are pretty gruesome and the movie is unapologetically mean and nasty with some clever kills. The back story has been revealed throughout the previews but who the killer is and that third act really got me by surprise.One minute it's playing like a black comedy then the next some dumb idiot is getting chopped up. While some remember those slasher movies from back in the day as bad, fans like me remember the mystery of who the killer is with the big reveal. We went for those Tom Savini make up effects and here you can see these kills kills were heavily inspired by the make up genius.

Thanksgiving,"Even for a slasher pic, Thanksgiving is crude, messy (in every sense of the word) and ridiculously over-the-top. Far from being an homage to Friday 13th, Scream etc it's a mockery of the genre, devoid of any merit. It lacks a shred of originality, and tries to make up for this by going for grossness in ridiculous ways. I have a strong stomach, but grossness simply for grossness' sake makes me shake my head.Other than gore, there's no plot. There's no style, no elan - there's not even a character worth rooting for. There's no talent, either. Everything - writing, acting, directing, camera-work - is just dialled-in, by-the-numbers stuff. Usually the wrong numbers.I might add that the poster is misleading - presumably deliberately. It gives the impression that this is going to be a period piece - which might've been interesting.

Thanksgiving,"At this point one would think after all these movies, Eli Roth would learn how to make a good movie.Unfortunately, he didn't so he doesn't.While the premise is fine and plot could be salvaged with someone better at writing, the whole movie is quickly spiraling into your average stupid slasher movie.They probably tried to make a new Scream like movie, but failed.There is so many, many (not important) characters in this that waste screentime, so many unused chekhov guns that is not even funny.Even worse, there are many plot dead ends, which is somehow worse than having a good ol' plot hole. For example - part about store camera backups. It looks like an important part of the plot but no, it just resolves itself in the minutes after being mentioned. And it was resolved by one of the characters just watching those backups at some random point, concentrating on the dumbest part of it, printing some photos and going to police. What?Having so many unncessary characters is probably seen on paper like having so many options for viewer to think who is the killer - ""Oooh, no, who it is, ooohh"". But in reality it just wastes screen time and the only thing getting killed is any hope for plot coherence.Which brings me to the pacing of the movie. It's done so amateursh and incompetent that I go back to the first sentence - how did this dude didn't learn after all these years to make a coherent story flow? There is no sense of time in the movie, no sense of space, no sense of plot order. Things just happen.One of the worst things a movie can do is to make viewer constantly think ""That doesn't seem right/That's stupid/What?"" while watching a movie.The ending also looks super slapped on, contrived at best.It's not the worst movie ever, or from this year, but it ain't good.

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"Kenneth Branagh's third foray into Agatha Christie territory doesn't have the handicap of previous all-star movie adaptations to be compared with. This has enabled him to make savings with a slightly B-list cast (no disrespect intended). And, by taking one of the less well-known Poirot cases as its core, Branagh is able to put more of his own stamp on the project. This is not such a ""sacred text"" as DEATH ON THE NILE and ORIENT EXPRESS.Sorry to say, these factors have not proved advantageous. A HAUNTING IN VENICE seems rather under-scripted and under-played. A séance in a decaying palace in Venice ends in a murder, with all those present anxious to prevent the medium (Michelle Yeoh, miscast but on fine form) revealing their secrets. There's not enough back-story to establish character and motives. Even Poirot (Branagh) is a bit flat this time. Jude Hill as a precocious schoolboy steals the acting honours with a performance possibly inspired by Paul Dano.The cinematography lavishly evokes a dark mysterious Venice redolent of DON'T LOOK NOW. Unfortunately, murkiness overwhelms too many of the interior scenes, heightening confusion rather than tension for at least one viewer. Maybe Mr Branagh should invest his considerable talent in revisiting a different 20th-century author: is Anthony Powell due for a revamp?","Kenneth Branagh 's third foray Agatha Christie territory n't handicap previous all-star movie adaptations compared . enabled make savings slightly B-list cast ( disrespect intended ) . , taking one less well-known Poirot cases core , Branagh able put stamp project . `` sacred text '' DEATH NILE ORIENT EXPRESS.Sorry say , factors proved advantageous .

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"In the third theatrical telling of a story featuring the unconventional detective Hercule Poirot, we get a slightly spookier version of the ""whodunit"" fare.While it's less ostentatious than 2017's 'Murder on the Orient Express' and less scenic than 2022's (inferior) 'Death on the Nile,' 2023's 'A Haunting in Venice' is a more subdued murder mystery that relies on solid acting and a suspension of reality to bring things to life.Kenneth Branagh is once again in perfect form in his dual role as protagonist and director, and this time he's supported by the likes of Michelle Yeoh, Jamie Dornan, Kelly Reilly and (least likely to be expected in a film adaptation of an Agatha Christie story) Tina Fey. While this film series typically brings in some ""names"" to help these characters come to life, 'Venice' didn't hold much back - and they all deliver.As for the film itself, don't go into it expecting a straight up horror movie. While the centerpiece of the film is an investigation into a murder that follows a séance in an old Venetian orphanage (creepy enough?), the focus is primarily on the ""who"" involved - much as you'd expect based on how these plots typically unfold. There are some pretty clutch moments mixed in with a few standard jump scares, but the twist that comes at the film's climax is not necessarily predictable.It can be said that Poirot's box office star is fading compared to when the character first took to the silver screen, but 'Venice' could just be what the doctor ordered to get this franchise back on track.","third theatrical telling story featuring unconventional detective Hercule Poirot , get slightly spookier version `` whodunit '' fare.While 's less ostentatious 2017 's 'Murder Orient Express ' less scenic 2022 's ( inferior ) 'Death Nile , ' 2023 's 'A Haunting Venice ' subdued murder mystery relies solid acting suspension reality bring things life.Kenneth Branagh perfect form dual role protagonist director , time 's supported likes Michelle Yeoh , Jamie Dornan , Kelly Reilly ( least likely expected film adaptation Agatha Christie story ) Tina Fey . film series typically brings `` names '' help characters come life , 'Venice ' n't hold much back - deliver.As film , n't go expecting straight horror movie . centerpiece film investigation murder follows séance old Venetian orphanage ( creepy enough ? ) , focus primarily `` '' involved - much 'd expect based plots typically unfold . pretty clutch moments mixed standard jump scares , twist comes film 's climax necessarily predictable.It said Poirot 's box office star fading compared character first took silver screen , 'Venice ' could doctor ordered get franchise back track .","third theatric tell stori featur unconvent detect hercul poirot , get slightli spookier version `` whodunit '' fare.whil 's less ostentati 2017 's 'murder orient express ' less scenic 2022 's ( inferior ) 'death nile , ' 2023 's 'A haunt venic ' subdu murder mysteri reli solid act suspens realiti bring thing life.kenneth branagh perfect form dual role protagonist director , time 's support like michel yeoh , jami dornan , kelli reilli ( least like expect film adapt agatha christi stori ) tina fey . film seri typic bring `` name '' help charact come life , 'venic ' n't hold much back - deliver.a film , n't go expect straight horror movi . centerpiec film investig murder follow séanc old venetian orphanag ( creepi enough ? ) , focu primarili `` '' involv - much 'd expect base plot typic unfold . pretti clutch moment mix standard jump scare , twist come film 's climax necessarili predictable.it said poirot 's box offic star fade compar charact first took silver screen , 'venic ' could doctor order get franchis back track .",good,negative,-0.7414
A_Haunting_in_Venice,"I generally love a murder mystery, and while I didn't think the Death on the Nile or the Orient Express were phenomenal, they were enjoyable to watch nonetheless.This one, however, was way worse. The writing was pretty bad from the start, leaving both the conversations and acting boring to watch and difficult to engage with. Fey and Reilley's acting leaves a lot to be desired, they both appear wooden and unnatural. Perhaps Fey leans too much into her comedic and sketch act persona, which doesn't do well in this movie. Reilley's character and acting are so cliché that it is unpleasant to watch. Other characters aren't much better, perhaps it was just a bad combination of actor selection and writing, and it doesn't work well.Overall, the film starts slow and boring and it never picks up, leaving the audience to endure a tedious experience that never really sucks you in but is interrupted by watching the clock, waiting for it to end.

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"Kenneth Branagh's ""A Haunting in Venice"" features a haunting melody that evokes a bright, cheery vision of early 20th-century America. The melody is a welcome but incongruous choice of music, as it is absent from the movie set over a dark and stormy Halloween night in 1947 Italy. However, the allusion is later incorporated when a character reminisces about a time during the war when she sought refuge in the 1944 film ""Meet Me in St. Louis,"" a poignant testament to how movies can sustain us through our darkest hours. The film also features a Halloween sequence where unruly children attack their neighbors, build bonfires, and nearly derail a trolley car. This spirit of youthful anarchy makes it a clever reference point for ""A Haunting in Venice,"" loosely adapted from Agatha Christie's 1969 novel ""Hallowe'en Party,"" which is particularly concerned with the mischievous doings of children, alive and dead. The story takes place in a Venetian palazzo, rumored to be haunted by the ghosts of girls and boys who died during the plague. The palazzo owner, Rowena Drake, invites a famous medium, Mrs. Joyce Reynolds, to perform a séance to establish contact with the spirit of her daughter, Alicia, who died a year earlier in a canal accident. The tragedy is a part of the larger plot and serves as a backdrop for the All Hallows' Eve gathering. Hercule Poirot, a Belgian detective, is a party-pooper who is retired from official duty but still willing to take on cases that interest him. Poirot finds the idea of actual occult phenomena intolerable, and the filmmakers take pleasure in irritating him by using the cozy tropes of classical detective stories and steering them towards full-throttle supernatural horror with jolting sound effects and grisly imagery. The film explores themes of occult phenomena and the dangers of embracing a different perspective. ""A Haunting in Venice"" is Branagh's best of his three big-screen Christie adaptations, despite being the most unfaithful. The film improves on one of Poirot's least memorable cases, ""Hallowe'en Party,"" where a 13-year-old girl is found drowned in an apple-bobbing tub. Instead of focusing on the murder, the movie portrays Poirot as nearly assassinated by a killer whose ruthlessness is less surprising than their identity. The film is beautifully shot on location by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos. Branagh and his collaborators, including production designer John Paul Kelly and costume designer Sammy Sheldon, create a captivating film set in Venice. Zambarloukos manages to capture the city's spookiness and madness through extremely canted angles, such as sideways-slanted shots of piazzas and upward-gazing shots of open doorways. These visual flourishes underscore the setting's spookiness and madness, creating a world filled with secret passageways and pitch-black shadows that make viewers feel too happily lost. ""A Haunting in Venice"" is Kenneth Branagh's best Hercule Poirot movie, renowned for its respectful adaptation of Agatha Christie's Hallowe'en Party. The film is both clever and visually dense, using the latest technology to create a visually rich and clever ""old"" movie. ""A Haunting in Venice"" was shot digitally in IMAX resolution, resulting in mesmerizing hyper-clarity and a shimmering, unreal, almost otherworldly aspect. The film's tight close-ups and actors' eyes seem to be lit from within, making it rare to see movies in this style anymore. The excessive amount of detail in the film can be intoxicating.","Kenneth Branagh 's `` Haunting Venice '' features haunting melody evokes bright , cheery vision early 20th-century America . melody welcome incongruous choice music , absent movie set dark stormy Halloween night 1947 Italy .

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"As an avid Agatha fan since I was a child, perhaps I always had high expectations for her book adaptations, and rarely do i get impressed. It's surely not an easy task, to adapt her writing, but none the less, movie should be made to rivet you to the screen, to keep you guessing and wondering, not to have you looking for books on amazon while watching it. If this move had all nameless actors with no Hollywood rep in it, this wouldn't even make it to cable TV in Timbuktu and nobody would bat an eyelid at it. Cheap theatrics were employed here and there to artificially inflate on-screen tension and have the audience jump up a bit, but even that was rubbish and as far movie suspense goes, that was about it. Thankfully, I didn't pay to watch this otherwise I'd be super annoyed. It's a decent flick to kill some time when nothing good is on, but it's a poor AC book adaptation and not a worthy representation of an excellent mystery novel.","avid Agatha fan since child , perhaps always high expectations book adaptations , rarely get impressed .

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"This movie scores for the points mentioned in Matt Zoller Seitz's review (namely its references to Welles and post-war cinema), some gorgeous visions of Venice, and an appearance by Riccardo Scamarcio (the token Italian, but a darkly, deliciously smoldering one) - but otherwise, I enjoyed little of it.It stumbles off the mark with a series of disjointed cuts and musical cues that last all of 5 seconds before skipping along to the next tonal diversion, leaving me cold. It then introduces Tina Fey, whose SNL energy poisons every scene she's in. Clearly, the filmmakers expect us to dislike her - but she made me dislike the movie, too.My desire to connect to the setting and genre was further stymied by corny, overwrought dialogue (""listening, listening""); a weak attempt at making up for lack of creep with excessive jump scares; and emotional energy from characters that often doesn't quite match what the context would support.I WILL give it props for a finale exposition that makes the most of, shall we say, a sophisticated complication of mens rea.Verdict: perhaps this movie is just not for me (I disliked Death On the Nile for similar reasons - so at least Branagh is consistent), but it felt like playing a video game with other players who lag a bit too much: with incomplete connective tissue, the experience is jarring, disorienting, frustrating, and hard to track with.

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"'A Haunting in Venice' is the third (and maybe final?) film in the Agatha Christie series directed by Kenneth Branagh, and starring him as genius detective Hercule Poirot, after 'Murder on the Orient Express' and 'Death on the Nile'. This time, 1947 Venice is the setting, with the Italian canals and rooftops adding to the overall vibe. Poirot is coxed out of retirement by Ariadne (Fey) to come to a Halloween party and séance to disprove a medium, Reynolds (Yeoh).Obviously, someone is murdered and Poirot is back on the case. The plot is thickened, as Rowena (Reilly)'s daughter mysteriously died in the past year, and we're not sure how it's connected. There's a fine-line tread between ghosts/spirits here and Poirot's scepticism/logic. All is eventually revealed. Once the murder occurs, there are 10 suspects left in the palazzo - including a Doctor (Dornan), bodyguard (Portfoglio), ex-boyfriend Maxim (Allen) and housekeeper (Cottin) - and Poirot goes about collecting their stories and alibis.This film is shorter than previous two films, but does seem a bit scattershot for the first 30min, with lots of odd cuts and camera angles, mostly trying to put us of the scent of what's actually happening. But I did feel that Poirot felt a little tired and lacked some verve. Might just be that Branagh is now in his 60s! Since it's set in the early hours of Halloween in an old building in the 40s, there's a lot of darkness/candle-lighting, so it's sometimes hard to see what's going on. The culprit is a bit of a surprise, and the reasoning just makes sense.","'A Haunting Venice ' third ( maybe final ? ) film Agatha Christie series directed Kenneth Branagh , starring genius detective Hercule Poirot , 'Murder Orient Express ' 'Death Nile ' . time , 1947 Venice setting , Italian canals rooftops adding overall vibe .

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"Written by Agatha Christie and Michael Green, A Haunting in Venice is the kind of twisted mystery you would expect from Ms. Christie.Set in Venice following WWII, A Haunting in Venice brings together an unlikely group with the combined goal of reaching beyond the veil of death to communicate with a young woman who was driven to suicide by the ghosts that supposedly haunt her house.The medium, the ex-fiancé, the skeptic, the writer and of course the mother, along with other supporting characters, make up the cast of suspects when bodies start turning up in the locked house.Kenneth Branagh directs and stars in this horror drama along with names such as Tina Fey, Jamie Dornan, Michelle Yeoh and Kelly Reilly. Unfortunately, although the setting is beautiful and there are some real stand out performances, such as that by the young Jude Hill, overall this movie failed to keep attention.There was an awkward humor about the film every time Fey was on screen that made you wonder if it was supposed to have an element of funny but then you realize that, no, that's just what we've come to expect from Ms Fey. There was also a sense that maybe Branagh had seen Clue one too many times and while he was going for something more dramatic there is the chaos amusement of Clue about the film but it doesn't really work for the story line or the rest of the ambience of the film.At the end of the day, with so much out there to read and watch and listen to, I give this movie a 2/5 and suggest skipping it.","Written Agatha Christie Michael Green , Haunting Venice kind twisted mystery would expect Ms. Christie.Set Venice following WWII , Haunting Venice brings together unlikely group combined goal reaching beyond veil death communicate young woman driven suicide ghosts supposedly haunt house.The medium , ex-fiancé , skeptic , writer course mother , along supporting characters , make cast suspects bodies start turning locked house.Kenneth Branagh directs stars horror drama along names Tina Fey , Jamie Dornan , Michelle Yeoh Kelly Reilly .

A_Haunting_in_Venice,I liked how dark and dreary the film felt with its scenery and the stormy weather. At first it felt like this might be a mystery movie that would be interesting but once the murder takes place the film becomes very bland. The mystery just isn't interesting enough to make one care about what happened or why it happened.All of the characters are pretty one dimensional even if the film attempts to give them a backstory. Their stories were just long enough to try to link them to the crime and make this movie a mystery.Overall this was just poorly written. The ending was very weak and was not satisfying at all.,liked dark dreary film felt scenery stormy weather . first felt like might mystery movie would interesting murder takes place film becomes bland . mystery n't interesting enough make one care happened happened.All characters pretty one dimensional even film attempts give backstory . stories long enough try link crime make movie mystery.Overall poorly written . ending weak satisfying .,like dark dreari film felt sceneri stormi weather . first felt like might mysteri movi would interest murder take place film becom bland . mysteri n't interest enough make one care happen happened.al charact pretti one dimension even film attempt give backstori . stori long enough tri link crime make movi mystery.overal poorli written . end weak satisfi .,bad,negative,-0.7059

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"Guess who's back, Streamers? Hercule Poirot returns to solve another murder mystery in A Haunting in Venice. This movie is the third in a series of Agatha Christie adaptations directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh as the world renown detective. We all love a good murder mystery, am I right? A Haunting in Venice has a tinge of the supernatural just in time for Halloween season. Here's how it went.A Haunting in Venice is a loose adaptation of a later novel by Christie, Hallowe'en Party. In this movie, we find Poirot (Branagh) retired in Venice in 1947. He is avoiding potential client who want him to solve their various mysteries. However, when Poirot's bodyguard allows his friend, Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey), a mystery novelist, in to see him, Poirot is confronted with a new mystery. Ariadne wants Poirot to attend a séance at the haunted palazzo of Rowena Drake (Kelly Reilly) to expose a psychic, Joyce Reynolds (Michelle Yeoh), as a fraud. Unable to resist, Poirot obliges Ariadne and attends the Halloween party and ensuing séance where things aren't all as they seem. Bumps in the night and deductive reasoning ensue.Branagh previously directed Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile, which were mildly successful in bringing back these stodgy murder mysteries of Christie's. A Haunting in Venice is more of the same, but the setting does give a different energy to this movie. Venice looks good. From aerial shots and depictions of the canals, it all looks good. Additionally, the production design and costumes are well-done enough such that we are firmly anchored in the time and place of post-war Venice. I will say that the film looks too dark. It is difficult to tell at times what's going on, and I do not think that it was intentionally done in order to add to the mystery. It feels like a frustrating mistake in the cinematography.Here's my big issue with this movie: the mystery is not interesting. The outcome of this whodunnit is pretty obvious early on. Moreover, it is not explained well in the end. The movie feels both perfunctory and bored with itself. There are some interesting characters particularly Jamie Dornan's Dr. Ferrier and his son Leopold played by Jude Hill. On the other hand, Tina Fey is not good in this. She's out of place and takes you out of the movie every time she speaks, which is unfortunate.Ultimately, A Haunting in Venice is a ho-hum effort at injecting horror/supernatural elements into the well-worn murder mystery genre. If you liked the previous Branagh Agatha Christie adaptations, you'll probably enjoy this, but it really not worth the time, money or trip to the theater. Everything is fine, but nothing is exciting or interesting enough for anything more than one popped kernel of popcorn.","Guess 's back , Streamers ?

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"Murder on the Orient Express was a very good start to the new films, the second film Death on the Nile was quite good, then came this third entry, the first time the story has been brought to the screen, based on the book Halloween Party by Agatha Christie, directed by Kenneth Branagh (Henry V, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Hamlet, Thor). Basically, in 1947, Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) has retired and is living in post-war Venice, with former police officer Vitale Portfoglio (Riccardo Scamarcio) employed as his bodyguard. On Halloween, mystery writer Ariadne Oliver (Tina Fey) convinces Poirot to attend a séance at the palazzo of opera singer Rowena Drake (Kelly Reilly). Oliver wants to expose medium Joyce Reynolds (Michelle Yeoh) as a fraud. Rowena has hired Joyce to communicate with her dead daughter Alicia (Rowan Robinson), who committed suicide a year ago after her fiancé, chef Maxime Gerard (Kyle Allen), broke off their engagement. Guests attending the evening are Maxime, Rowena's housekeeper Olga Seminoff (Camille Cottin), Drake family doctor Leslie Ferrier (Jamie Dornan) and his son Leopold (Belfast's Jude Hill), and Joyce's Romani assistant Desdemona Holland (Emma Laird). During the séance, Poirot deduces Joyce has two assistants, revealing Desdemona's half-brother Nicholas (Ali Khan) hiding in the chimney. But then Joyce speaks to Rowena in Alicia's voice, revealing that she was murdered, stating that one of the guests was her murderer. Poirot tries to confront Joyce; she tells him to lighten up and dresses him in a mask and cloak for Halloween. Poirot takes her advice and bobs for apples but is nearly drowned by an unknown assailant. Moments later, after the strike of midnight, Joyce is seen falling from a balcony and impaled on a statue in the courtyard. A storm stops anybody leaving the palazzo, allowing Poirot to individually interview all trapped guests as to their whereabouts during Joyce's murder. During the interviews, Poirot finds himself hallucinating, seeing Alicia's ghost. Leslie is severely traumatised after being held in a concentration camp, and he is in love with Rowena. Maxime was not invited to the evening; he broke off his engagement because he thought Rowena did not approve of him and that Alicia was obsessed with keeping her happy. Leopold claims he hears the voices of dead children from when the palazzo was an orphanage, they are said to haunt and kill doctors and nurses who enter the building. Nicholas and Desdemona have been stealing from Joyce and intend to travel to St. Louis, Missouri after seeing the film Meet Me in St. Louis. Later, the guests discover an underground chamber containing the skeletons of dead children. Leslie suffers a panic attack and nearly kills Maxime. He is locked in the music room to calm down, with Rowena giving Poirot the only key. Poirot deduces that Maxime received an invitation from Oliver and that she and Vitale conspired to bring him to the palazzo. Vitale investigated Alicia's death and gave Joyce private details, while Oliver admits she hopes to write a new book based on Poirot's incapability of explaining the séance. Leslie is then found stabbed to death. The remaining guests are gathered, with Poirot exposing Rowena as the murderer. She was obsessed with keeping Alicia to herself, cutting off contact with Maxime, and weakened her using tea ladened with honey extracted from rhododendrons (a deadly species of bees). One night, while watching over Alicia, Olga unknowingly gave her tea containing a fatal dose. Fearing she would be exposed for poisoning, Rowena staged Alicia's suicide. She used the same honey to cause Poirot's hallucinations. Rowena received blackmail threats and suspected Joyce or Leslie. She pushed Joyce to her death after mistakenly trying to drown Poirot and forced Leslie to stab himself, threatening to kill Leopold if he refused, hoping to get away with blaming the deaths on the children's curse. Rowena tries to escape and goes to the roof where Poirot confronts her. Alicia's ghost seemingly appears and pulls Rowena down, causing her to fall into the water and drown. In the morning after the storm has ended, Oliver leaves Poirot, he says he will not mention Vitale's involvement in the séance, and privately exposes Leopold as the blackmailer. Leopold explains that he recognised the poisoning, seeing a connection with Rowena's first starring role in an opera, with the lead character called the ""king of poisons"". Poirot suggests Leopold and Olga clear their consciences by using the money to help Desdemona's family. Poirot intends to return home and return to work as a detective and accept new cases. Also starring Amir El-Masry as Alessandro Longo. Branagh is having fun with the accent and the wonderfully ridiculous moustache, the supporting cast of famous faces all do their parts fine, and the murder setup and conclusion are gripping enough. The pace is a bit uneven at times, but it just about keeps you guessing, the traditional ""gathering"" scene is alright, the slight gothic horror element is intriguing, and its period detail and style are good, it is a reasonable murder mystery.

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I thought it would be. Then again, I thought that it would be completely and utterly terrible. Instead, it is an OK murder mystery, nothing great nor spectacular, but it manages to keep attention, which is quite a rare thing in movies these days. Then again, I would almost say that this is not a Poirot movie, but a mystery movie that tries to piggyback on Poirot's name and fame in order to sell better. There are too many things that are wrong for a Poirot movie: the over the top insistence on supernatural moments, and being ambiguous at the end whether something supernatural did exist, has no place in a Poirot movie. Poirot was always firmly realistic and even if there was anything that seemed supernatural at first, it was always unambiguously rationally explained in the end. Then there is the completely out of character moment when Poirot dunks his head in a bowl of water trying to catch an apple with his mouth - a thing that he would never do. And finally, we even get Poirot the tough guy when he kicks down a door. Completely ridiculous.Other than that, the movie, for no reason, manages to cram in a seemingly obligatory ""men bad"" moment. When we find out that the ex fiance broke up with Alicia because of her sick, codependent relationship with her mother, Tina Fey (who is absolutely the worst and most obnoxious character in the movie) berates him for breaking up an engagement because ""a woman made him feel small"". The woke stupidity is off the charts here. No sane person should ever get involved with someone who has that kind of unhealthy relationship with their parents, and that has nothing to do with being a man, woman, dolphin or whatever. But it seems that Hollywood just has to do this crap in every movie, no matter how out of place it is.Fey's character is horrible and it is completely unbelievable how Poirot gives her a pass even though she deliberately deceived him and tried to ruin his reputation and in the end acted as if she did nothing wrong.Camera work is often weird, with strange angles for no reason, which is often annoying and distracting.If you love Poirot, and wish to see this movie, tell yourself that this is not really a Poirot movie. You'll find it more enjoyable that way.","Honestly , movie lot better thought would . , thought would completely utterly terrible .

Kenneth returns as the detective that was created by Agatha Christie and this movie is inspired by her 1969 novel, Halloween Party-a few changes were made from the original script for this movie. In this film, Kenneth has retired and is living in Venice when an old friend, Tina, shows up and wants his help busting a fake psychic. Kelly plays a woman whose child has died and Michelle is going to perform a seance for Kelly to talk to the daughter. Tina has tried to bust Michelle-unsuccessfully so far-so she turns to Kenneth. Michelle claims to be the real thing but Kenneth doesn't believe in the supernatural. The writing is great, as usual, for the Hercule Poirot stories and there are plenty of suspects, as more murders do occur and Kenneth sees things that even he has problems explaining.It's rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.","saw Haunting Venice , starring Kenneth Branagh-Tenet , Wild Wild West_1999 ; Tina Fey-SNL_tv , Baby Mama ; Michelle Yeoh-Everything Everywhere , Tomorrow Never Dies Kelly Reilly-Yellowstone_tv , Sherlock Holmes movies.This third Hercule Poirot movies Kenneth Branagh remaking , following 2017 Murder Orient Express & 2022 Death Nile-all enjoyed .

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"Very far from a horror, and a mid whodunnit. Opened with a jump scare, was hoping that wasn't gonna be all that the movie is about; there's a few but the movie isn't a horror by any means. It is set in post world war Italy, it's mentioned several times throughout the movie as the characters grapple with consequences of postwar era.The movie lacks the eerie atmosphere commonly found in horror films because, in reality, it's more of a murder mystery in the Poirot franchise. I personally think it missed the mark. It's not supernatural either, although that theme plays an important role in the movie, influencing some of the characters' actions and personalities. I wished it had a scarier rating than PG-13. It felt more like a spooky campfire story told with proper Victorian language, largely due to the extensive narration. The dialogue itself was decent and had a certain wit without feeling forced.While the cast gave decent performances, there wasn't much they could do to elevate the movie. It reminded me of the sentiment expressed in ""See How They Run (2022)"" that if you've seen one whodunnit film, you've seen them all, and this film seemed to confirm that. The camera work, perhaps due to the IMAX viewing, felt shaky, and the edges of the screen often appeared blurry.The story itself wasn't particularly engaging, and when the mystery was finally unraveled, it didn't have a strong climax. The plot twists were just okay, and they couldn't make up for the shortcomings of the underlying story. I found it hard to become invested in the movie or its characters, so I didn't care much about how everything unfolded. This film was advertised as a horror but ended up being a mediocre whodunnit with a few jump scares, failing to excel at being interesting in either genre.","far horror , mid whodunnit .

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"The one thing a good whodunnit should not do is put its audience to sleep. Unfortunately, this latest cinematic adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel fails miserably on this score. Director Kenneth Branagh's third outing as Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot is a protracted snooze that leaves viewers caring little about the characters and even less about the story in which they're trapped. When the famed detective (Branagh) - now in retirement in Venice - is called upon by a friend and author of murder mysteries (Tina Fey) to help her verify or discredit the psychic powers of a medium (Michelle Yeoh) at a séance at an allegedly haunted Venetian palazzo, he's drawn into yet another of his famous investigations. The problem here is that what should be an engaging story is interminably dull, one that, regrettably, prompts frequent checking of one's watch. Moreover, virtually the entire film is shot with excessively dark camera work (so much for showing off the glories of Venice). And then there are the performances, which feature good turns by Yeoh and Jude Hill but a positively wooden portrayal by Branagh (compared to his previous depictions of the protagonist) and an absolutely dreadful performance by a woefully miscast Fey. To its credit, like its recent predecessors, the production values of this Christie offering are top shelf, but that's about all this release has going for it, a far cry from the much better overall work found in ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (2017) and ""Death on the Nile"" (2023).

It would seem history has repeated itself, people still want Poirot; but what we really need is something completely new from the drawing board. Christie would (probably) grimace to think that Poirot is getting a ""Poirotverse"" for-profit film series quarter way into the 21st century. Maybe the hunky, eccentric Benoit Blanc is a better sleuth-in-vogue or, dare one say, give the limelight to a fresh faced, budding whodunnit author. Instead, Branagh is eagerly sinking his teeth into what looks like a long dreary commercial march through 33 novels and 51 short stories of source material.This film sets out to combine the whodunnit with the horror genre and misses the mark on both. The meticulous, verbose, people-focused nature of the Christie-style whodunnit struggles to pair well with the timely, atmospheric build-ups of horror. Both needed time to deliver their respective punchlines. Neither had the scope to do it, and the waters became quickly muddied. The musical score (snore) is notably absent; sometimes using gaps of silence can be eerie and build tension, but here it's so overdone that the effect falls flat. The Dutch angle is used excessively and jarringly, and the film's direction just feels overall disjointed as Branagh both acts and directs. The screenplay is lifeless, the setting is dark and lifeless, the plot's culmination is lifeless. No joie de vivre, no buoyancy. One highlight would be Michelle Yeoh.If you're a Christie fan or devotee, you'll likely be pleased just seeing a depiction of Poirot on-screen, I'm sure. But for most people, I'd imagine this may disappoint.","1930 , Agatha Christie fed highly storied , by-then `` insufferable '' Hercule Poirot .

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"I am not going to lie, I was very intrigued for this latest Agatha Christie Hercule Poirot offering. Unfortunately My hopes and excitement vanished within 15 minutes into the film when I realized how badly directed this was and how deadly dull the vibe of this film was going to be.There was no energy to the proceedings. The odd camera angles made my eyes roll. It was going for a artsy fartsy pretentious look with a oh so serious note that lacked any fun or thrill.I kid you not, halfway through one of the five at evening showing audience member started snoring.Tina Fey was horribly miscast and the guy from Fifty Shades was beyond bland and his acting was pure cringe. Aside from a few super lame jump scares this movie was so boring and a cinematic cure for insomnia. Michelle Yeoh and her bad wig needed to cash a paycheck because her role was beyond short and wasted.Everyone looked miserable and slightly embarrassed to be in this. I kinda wished it had camp appeal but everything played so serious and nothing about this was remotely unintentionally funny.The reveal at the end was so lackluster and dumb, it felt like you were watching a really bad Hallmark Mystery TV Series. This movie is going to bomb hard. It's pure cinematic torture and one of the years worst.","going lie , intrigued latest Agatha Christie Hercule Poirot offering .

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"Forget the early 9/10 shill reviews, this movie is just plain terrible. The script is VERY dull, with pacing and tonal issues, but what really destroys the film is the visual mise en scene and the terrible editing. The whole film is shot at strange, jarring angles, many times with fisheye lenses. The camera will also spin or move around bizarrely for no reason.Then, there's the cinematography. The night scenes are so badly under lit it's hard to make out anything that's happening. Couple that with machine gun-paced editing and it is literally impossible to feel pulled into teh story. Branagh just does his darnest to make sure the technique always gets between you and the story.The film sports a stellar cast, yet most of the actors are truly terrible in this, including Branagh as Poirot who kept getting laughter in the theater I went to every time he spoke.Disclaimer, I walked out 30 min before the ending. I just figured I'd rather go home and do something I'll truly enjoy.","Forget early 9/10 shill reviews , movie plain terrible . script dull , pacing tonal issues , really destroys film visual mise en scene terrible editing . whole film shot strange , jarring angles , many times fisheye lenses . camera also spin move around bizarrely reason.Then , 's cinematography . night scenes badly lit 's hard make anything 's happening .

A_Haunting_in_Venice,"A Haunting in Venice is a movie that claims to be based on Agatha Christie's novel Hallowe'en Party. However, the movie changes almost everything from the book, from the title, the setting, the premise, the tone, the characters, the timeline, the murder victim, and the murderer's identity. The movie makes many changes to enhance the story and create a suspenseful and mysterious experience for the audience. The movie also introduces supernatural elements and blurs the line between hallucinations and genuine ghostly encounters, while the book focuses on ordinary murders committed by regular people.Similarities? Hmm, both works feature Hercule Poirot as the main detective who solves the case with his brilliant mind and keen observation skills. Both works involve a murder that occurs during a Halloween event (a party in the book and a séance in the movie) and has a connection to a past crime.A Haunting in Venice diverges significantly from Hallowe'en Party, so that it's unrecognizable. Worse, Poirot is also unrecognizable. Poirot would never say the truth is sad, or there is no God or soul. He was a devout Catholic. He would not solve cases based on clues but on psychology. Ariadne Oliver would never betray Poirot's friendship.What a sad little movie that was.","Haunting Venice movie claims based Agatha Christie 's novel Hallowe'en Party .

Past_Lives,"No pun intended - I can't speak for others, but I have or rather had a similar situation. And like the movie, it was the girl that left - though in my case she only left to Greece (and I stayed in Germany). What could have been? It really is crazy thinking about it - losing your best friend, but maybe also the one person you may have ended up with? It can really mess with your mind, if you think too much about it.Of course those are the similarities. Since the distance is closer, I reckon I could have been more aggressive in contacting her. She lived her life, married, got kids, divorced ... not sure what she is up to now. I have given up a long time ago. I don't even know her - and she does not know me. The movie is different than ... my story. The guy is really out there looking for her - and she seems to be open to let him back into her life.Btw even without having read about the story, I was able to detect and guess what the three people were up to - or rather what relationships they had amongst each other. It is a guessing game some people have going on- we never meet them. Won't tell you if they guess it right - the movie has you guessing a lot. And it is quite straining. Not so much because of the pacing - that is slow too, but because of the feelings ... of the things not spoken (out), but also the things that are said aloud.Life is what you make it - life is choices ... sometimes it is about second chances ... sometimes it is about letting things go ... sometimes it is about the things that others expect from us ... even without them knowing they do expect them ... let it not be too late!

Past_Lives,"I saw Past Lives alone on a Sunday morning with 3 other single men in the theater. We all sat in opposite corners. Every single one of us cried, shamelessly, out loud as this movie concluded. If your movie makes 4 dudes show up alone to a movie at 10:30am on a Sunday and cry, you hit it out of the park.Past Lives takes an intimate look at the people we disconnect, and reconnect with, over the course of our lives. Specifically focusing on reconnecting with a childhood crush, Past Lives features an elite performance from Greta Lee in the lead role. She displays a range of emotion from tears you can feel to the somber, dry expressions many show when they simply don't know how to express their feelings.This film moves fast even though its pace is slow. The dialog shifting languages keeps your attention and creates the beautiful cultural connection needed to make this story of an immigrant and the man who stayed behind work. The way this story builds Greta's life in NY at the moment you believe they're finally going to connect... god this movie got me.I was blown away by this movie. It's the most I've felt in a movie in a long time. Sadness, angst, loneliness, fear, human connection. Past Lives is what most slow paced dramas wish they could be.","saw Past Lives alone Sunday morning 3 single men theater . sat opposite corners .

Past_Lives,"Immigration is hard. Leaving your friends and relatives is hard. Learning languages is hard. However, most of the time, it is all worth it.However, there are people who believe that life is by definition easier/better in an other country. They go through much pain and give up a lot in order to forge their life there. However, many years later, they might end up worse off than the family members that stayed in their country of origin. Usually, these are the people who try the hardest to justify their initial decision to immigrate.When I saw the movie, it struck me as a heavy case of that.In the beginning, a neighbor asks Nora's mother why they want to immigrate despite having good jobs. There are many valid reasons why a family would want to move from SK to North America. However, the answer that she gave felt very illusionary (USA has Nobel Prizes when Korea doesn't). They were moving there to chase a dream. Definitely not the right reason to uproot your whole family.Then, the movie gives clues about the difficulties that Nora went through. We see her going from a friendly class in SK to being lonely in Canada. She says to Hae Sung that she used to cry a lot when she immigrated, but then she understood that nobody cared.Nora breaks up with Hae Sung because she doesn't want to have gone through all that pain only to end up at her point of origin (Korea).She doubles down on her investment in becoming extraordinary in her new country. She marries her husband in part to obtain a Green Card. It is established that they have a good relationship, but he does not feel that she loves him. In fact, he says that if she would've met someone else with his ""credentials"" at the right moment, she'd be married with him. In other words, Nora married her husband more out of convenience than out of love.After Nora and Hae Sung meet, she says that he feels so Korean to her and that, when she is with him, she feels so American. Basically, the fact of growing up in America had an important impact on her values and character. She would've grown up a different individual had she stayed in SK. Nora even says that that girl (from SK) is gone.However, that girl is not completely gone. Nora's husband mentions that there is a part of her (her Korean part) that he doesn't have access to.We learn that Hae Sung has an average life with an average salary. There are some difficulties that he faces because he lives in Korea, such is unpaid overtime and military service. However, overall, he seems to be doing Ok for himself.Nora, for her part, has not won a Nobel or a Pulitzer prize. She equally lives an average life in a small apartment in New York. She even jokes with her husband that it is not the ""American dream"" that her parents expected when they immigrated.Nora broke up with Hae Sung because she was afraid to have gone through a lot of pain only to end up at her point of origin (Korea). However, at the end, she settled for an average life, not much different that she would've had in Korea. Arguably, she is even worse off, as she seems to be better suited with Hae Sung than she is with her husband. However, this is her life now. There is no way back.","Immigration hard .

The_Holdovers,"The HoldoversThis is a film that presents pain, suffering and grief internalized by the three main characters. A common theme centered around the negative ways these would manifest. I observed anger, addiction, intentional isolation by lashing out, and then judging other people for doing the same thing. It's a vicious cycle.I was moved by these themes because I have directly felt ""If you can't understand me, with no context whatsoever, then it's your fault, and I judge you for being stupid."" Each of the three has hidden secrets, and when they are stuck together at a boarding school Christmas of 1970, they slowly emerge.Mental health struggles continue to be a not completely understood subject. Disclosing visiting a therapist, or being seen taking medication, is not very easy, even today.I enjoyed watching the aforementioned internalized emotions break free of the self, and they all start to relate, causing the rifts to heal.

He talks about how his Dad changed and became violent, and then his Mom had him put away. I grew up with a mentally ill Dad who physically abusive. No one saved me, and my Dad can still function, but this still made the movie for me. Anyone with a mentally ill parents knows what it is to be seen. Mr. Hummel was able to break away from his Dad's abusive ways, and so will Angus. *End of spoilers.*I'm in the middle of the characters age wise, since I'm in my 30's, but I still relate to Angus a little more.

The_Holdovers,"Although this movie isnt the funniest out there, its a hearty and full movie nor is it easy pull a comedy and heartfelt drama like this today with a two hours long running time. The movie builds characters that are very well known to the movie-goes, the sour and strict teacher, the undisciplined problem maker and the hated schoolmater. But it builds the film around these character with mastery and allows for new emotions to come up, so it is not a repetition of the old trope. That is why i think this was a particulary difficult film to make- there were so many things that could go wrong but the film stands on its feet and creates its in scenario relationships with resepct and a renewed curiosity. That is why i give this film a 9/10 for pulling off a difficult feat.","Although movie isnt funniest , hearty full movie easy pull comedy heartfelt drama like today two hours long running time . movie builds characters well known movie-goes , sour strict teacher , undisciplined problem maker hated schoolmater . builds film around character mastery allows new emotions come , repetition old trope . think particulary difficult film make- many things could go wrong film stands feet creates scenario relationships resepct renewed curiosity . give film 9/10 pulling difficult feat .","although movi isnt funniest , hearti full movi easi pull comedi heartfelt drama like today two hour long run time . movi build charact well known movie-go , sour strict teacher , undisciplin problem maker hate schoolmat . build film around charact masteri allow new emot come , repetit old trope . think particulari difficult film make- mani thing could go wrong film stand feet creat scenario relationship resepct renew curios . give film 9/10 pull difficult feat .",good,negative,-0.621
The_Holdovers,"One does not expect a Christmas film to be challenging, and this one certainly isn't. But it is a lot of fun.A boys' boarding school empties of almost all staff and pupils for the 1970/1 Festive Season. Left behind are Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), the unpopular history teacher who has to keep an eye on the school; Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), a teenaged pupil whose mother does not want him on her honeymoon; and Mary Lamb (the impressively-named Da'Vine Joy Randolph), the school cook who is facing her first Christmas alone since her son died on military service. As these three lonely souls come together, there are tantrums, emotional revelations, the revealing of long-hidden secrets, a noble sacrifice... the usual stuff.Also the usual stuff are the characters: Paul is cynical and frustrated; Angus is ironic and insecure; and as Mary is overweight and black, she of course has to be sassy.But while in some films such predictability would be annoying, it works here. Within the limits of their somewhat two-dimensional personalities, the characters are well-written - even Angus' tantrums do not seem unreasonable. Plus, there are some great gags (""You hit him? You mean you punched him out?"" ""No, I hit him with a car..."") And I will not be the only viewer who finishes the film with a lump in his throat.Great fun.

The_Holdovers,"2h13m - Ugh, once again, why does Netflix think that movie length no longer matters just because most viewers stream them at home?Paul Hunham is a horrible little man who spends most of the movie complaining about his students and how uneducated and uninspired they all are, but isn't it his job to inspire and educate? He's a total disgrace as a teacher and as a human.He's charged with caring for a group of kids whose parents lived in an era before legal abortion was an option so they did the next best thing: they sent their unwanted offspring off to boarding school. The fact that they can't even be bothered with their kids at Christmas really drives home the argument for Planned Parenthood and all of its services.Old professor Crabby is not fun and wants to turn the holiday weeks into a juvie prison. In a desperate attempt to add balance and humor to the already foundering ship of this movie, they bring aboard the sassy Black lunch lady. Did I mention she has a dead son? Viet Nam. None of this matters because the lunch lady can't keep this thing afloat and she mostly sits it out on the sidelines smoking and drinking.The kid mouths off to a working-class guy playing pinball. Unlikely that some skinny little rich twerp would do that.Sorry, but a couple of off-hand Latin aphorisms isn't the same thing as a good script.Lots of time with no really big moments.

The_Holdovers,"On paper it hit its notes, but there was something wrong with it that I could not articulate. Then I realized. It's a bait and switch. They broke the entire concept of the movie. The entire premise is that they are stuck in the school together, to the point where when the helicopter takes off, you feel a sense of dread that they're now alone, trapped together and must make due, must find grace in the discomfort, learn all those lessons. This is a great premise for a film and it must work in that premise. SUDDENLY, they're going out to bars, to parties, to the city, to insane asylums, to bowling alleys. This is is a problem so fundamentally wrong with the movie it sinks the entire thing in my view. To start with, it's lazy, but artistically, it's cowardly. The helicopter taking off now means nothing because they hit the road regardless. Imagine in The Breakfast Club they escape the school and go on a road trip with ten different stops. It's no longer The Breakfast Club then, it becomes Ferris Bueller's Day Off; as in here, in the Holdover, there is no Holdover to speak of. They aren't trapped in the school, they just go wherever they fancy, with this gigantic god-eye copout of 'well we have a field trip fund so let's throw the screenplay out the window'. Bait and switching the premise is one of my great pet peeves in films, and it's a shame because they set out to make a great film but Payne couldn't help it, he is unable to break out this mold of making road-trip films, and there I was refreshed going in that he was trying something new.","paper hit notes , something wrong could articulate . realized .

Blue_Beetle,"So the aunt was developing weapons. The daughter did not like that but wasn't the one running the company. Her dad designed those weapons and built his own, which she used. It didn't make sense. Besides, there is nothing wrong with building enhanced suits for soldiers, that will save lives, when your being invaded by alien armies every few years!The room with the alien tech in it, didn't have anyone guarding it. She pickpockets a pass and walks in, then walks out. Walking past the entrance to another corridor that did have a guard next to it. What was in that corridor that it warranted a guard? And this one with the advanced weapon in it did not? Then the scientist she stole the pass from, walks back into the room without his pass?The building it put in lockdown, but the boy just walks out. So much for lock down.The beetle suit (and OMAC) is never explained. It can seemingly do anything but how? Where do the bullets come from? How are they replenished? How is it charged?When they drain the suit for the code, they tell us repeatedly it will kill him. They drain the code, but he lives. So what a waste of time. A plot point that went nowhere.Blue Beetle doesn't want to kill. But the Uncle is willing to stab people with the bug mobile legs. Grandma machine guns down security guards just doing their job.The Uncle builds a localised signal jammer, and the building he uses it on with high-tech weapons inside doesn't hit the alarm when all their feeds go dead. Besides the fact that there was zero guards in the main lobby, and the blue beetle tech is in a display cabinet which can be picked with a paperclip?The uncle can pilot the bug mobile having never seen it before, just because he drives a truck.

Blue_Beetle,"After graduating in the law school, Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns to Palmera City to meet his family, and soon he learns that they are broken and evicted from their home. His sister Milagro (Belissa Escobedo) gets a cleaning job for him at the mansion of the wealthy Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon). However, they are both fired by Victoria when Jaime interferes in a discussion between Victoria and her niece Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine). When Jaime is leaving the house, Jenny asks him to look for her in the Kord Tower for a job opportunity. On the next morning, Jenny learns that her aunt is using an ancient alien Scarab to develop powerful weapons and she steals the artifact. Meanwhile, Jaime is looking for her to get a job, and she uses him to leave the Tower with the scarab hidden in a burger to-go box. His curious Mexican family opens the box and Jaime becomes the host of the alien scarab and they fuse in a powerful weapon. Jaime looks for Jenny to have explanations but he turns into the Blue Beetle. She tells him that they have to remove the device as soon as possible; otherwise, the fusion will be permanent.I had expectations to see ""Blue Beatle"" mainly because of the Brazilian actress Bruna Marquezine in a lead role. However, the film is a great disappointment, with a terrible and long screenplay about another unknown superhero. The silly and ridiculous Mexican family spoils the whole movie with their foolish behavior. It is annoying to hear and see them, and it seems to be a critic to the behavior of Mexican families in particular, and Latin families in general, in a prejudicial view of the author. The humor does not work and it is unfunny actually. And based on the cliffhanger in the credits, it seems that the productors intend to make a sequel.

Blue_Beetle,"That's the more appropriate title for this movie, cause apparently the Blue Beetle isn't the Scarab. The one which crawled up Jaime's ass wasn't Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle was Jenny's Dad in his superhero form. False title if you ask me. The background story was uninteresting enough to pull the audience in. They should've shown more background on the Scarab. Where does it come from, what it actually is, what's its purpose. It'll give the audience more depth to tune in. The villain has created the bare minimum of threat to anyone to show any significance to be dealt with. So there's one more less reason to watch this movie. Usually Susan Sarandon delivers awesome performance either as an antagonist or protagonist. But in this movie, she kinda hovers around. But I understand that it wasn't her fault. She can only do so much with the script that's given to her. I feel bad for her. But alas, even with the negative reviews I've written, I still can't give it less than 6 stars. Cause at least it's more interesting than Black Widow. And I think the real Blue Beetle is coming in the next installment of this movie. I hope they'll do better next time. I'm giving it another star to give the writers some encouragement.","'s appropriate title movie , cause apparently Blue Beetle n't Scarab . one crawled Jaime 's ass n't Blue Beetle .

Blue_Beetle,"So much wasted potential in this movie.The first 45 minutes are incredibly slow and filled with disjointed plot/character development. The theme of ""family values"" is crowbarred into nearly every scene, but the script does a poor job connecting the audience to the characters.Susan Sarandon gives a wooden performance as a one-dimensional baddie. George Lopez falls flat as the zany tech-wizard uncle. Xolo Maridueña and
Bruna Marquezine are capable actors and fun to watch, but lack chemistry.Even in the thick of the action, pace is erratic. Bad Hollywood action cliches abound. Rather than overcome obstacles through strength of character, the good guys seem fated to win as teenage girls are able to fight professional mercenaries as equals.Overall, Blue Beetle comes across as a money grab. It copies elements of family superhero films (e.g., Antman) but fails to capture the heart. It takes itself too seriously at all the wrong times. It's just bad entertainment - I literally could not watch it all in one sitting because it was so painful to sit through.","much wasted potential movie.The first 45 minutes incredibly slow filled disjointed plot/character development . theme `` family values '' crowbarred nearly every scene , script poor job connecting audience characters.Susan Sarandon gives wooden performance one-dimensional baddie .

Lack of flashbacks: 7This movie is a giant mess and doesn't understand what it is trying to be or tell.The hero has a sister who constantly whines about how South American people have in hard in this city and how other people, likely White rich people, have it all and take it all no matter how hard these Mexican immigrants work so she doesn't even want to get an education or a proper job as it won't matter in her eyes. Yet the movie shows exactly why she is working low-paid jobs with no job prospects and her brother is working his way up. She uses a private bathroom then instead of trying to sneak herself out brags about her business while strolling out the stall catching the house owner, the evil lady, staring at her and firing her on the spot for being this dull headed. Anyone would have fired her here. She clearly shows she can't even follow basic rules or act civilized. And this type of behavior is constant from her so this one event just illustrated how she acts regularly. She's a racist hateful and extremely lazy uneducated worker. Her brother meanwhile just got this low-skill job and basically in what seems to be their first day gets a giant opportunity for getting a much better job in the company after being fired because of his sister. So a lead character got to explain her worldview with no one budding in and yet if you look at what is actually on screen it's the complete opposite. Yet there is never anyone to dispute any of the claims because the only White person here is the evil lady. They could have made this into some thematic debate yet she is just pure evil with no depth whatsoever.There is also a plot about how the giant tech company didn't make the evil lady CEO and instead made her brother CEO even though she ran it. The movie calls it out as sexist and tells this small story several times over. Yet from the very first scene she is made out to be an evil maniac who doesn't mind killing innocent people to get her way. She's nasty and evil to the bone and extremely open about this threatening people to their face just for fun. Apparently she turned evil after her brother got her job and then took over the job later on. But this is a hard sell. She was a great CEO then by not getting to keep her job turned into an extremely coldhearted murderer? This is an experience millions of people have in real life where they don't get their fair share. You get turned down or lose your job for unfair reasons all the time. Maybe even once every 5 years if you work in a competitive industry. If all those people turned into psychopaths we would have a huge problem. A more logical explanation would be that she was always pure evil and just hid this as she was gifted power from a young age because of nepotism and didn't need to step on toes. People saw this and replaced her and she clawed her way back. Actually, this would be a BETTER story. Instead everything is sexist or racist here. She experienced sexism and she is apparently racist. There is nothing deeper here.We also have the love interest literally cause a main death. An act that would make her hated forever in any real setting. Yet here they don't even mention it. Because obviously she's part of the good guys so her actions are therefore positive like in all other superhero movies. The movie doesn't care about what actually happens. It just forces a storyline into events that don't support this storyline whatsoever. It's like the writers didn't understand their own story which seems extremely common in modern movies that are largely produced. This trope scene is here, that trope scene is here. Step by step. Except they don't really create a storyline combined. Producers just selected them ahead of making the movie and forced a progressive immigrant theme onto everything and the writers just had to follow suit. Yet the themes are utter nonsense just forced into the movie via dialogue. It removes all depth and clearly this is why all actors phones it in.Everything here is extreme cringe. The acting is horrible and all dialogue is extremely on the nose in a way where even kids would notice this. Which is extra offensive as this is made for Latin Americans and other DC movies weren't this childish and silly. So they investigated the main market for this movie and figured out they had to make all characters constantly say what they were doing as they figured viewers wouldn't get it otherwise. Superhero movie viewers are not the smartest group of people overall, but this is made for people who don't even understand basic movie stories and have never seen a superhero movie before. So are Latin Americans in USA this clueless about basic superhero stuff? They have never seen a single superhero movie before?It's also extremely irritating how the lead does nothing. Everyone just pushes him around, but he's not even kind or smart. He's not even a clear weakling trying to stay safe. He's just nothing. He doesn't make any decisions and doesn't react or change things. His sister is bullying him because she's hateful and bigoted yet while they share parents he's completely different. They could at least have made him try to hide or avoid danger or responsibility like with Spiderman. Or made him into a regular guy trying to keep his life normal like with Clark Kent. Just some motivation in some direction even if it's something negative.The story overall is also nonsense even if we ignore the extremely cringe moral stuff. In one scene they need to break into a building and randomly we learn that a family member has made an extremely advanced system to shut down any security system anywhere even though this is an extremely advanced building with a room full of security guards controlling the IT security. We never learn why he knew all this extremely advanced IT stuff as an old guy or why he acts like a poor clown living with his brother when he is actually a genius. In another scene regular characters pick up weapons and become superheroes right away. Zero training. This is what modern movies do wrong. They always want to have some young girl also be a superhero and then create superheroes out of whole families. Which could work in some cases if they received training first and could die. If they are just like the main character superhero then obviously it means nothing. In another scene the main character has something extremely wrong with his body and needs to seek help right away. Yet his family is afraid of cops as they are illegal aliens. So they forbid him to seek help and freak out when he does. Again, this makes zero sense. He's 22. Why would they let him suffer and potentially die just to remain hidden? Are they psychopaths? He's an American citizen who just got his diploma yet suddenly he's not allowed to talk to doctors or people who may help? What?The movie looks and feels like a long episode of a dirt cheap TV show. But unfortunately TV shows have way better writing today. So besides the CGI being cheap and acting clearly all one-takes with no depth it doesn't even live up to a B tier TV show. Though I must admit some of the superhero TV shows are quite terrible. This is not just bad, this is unwatchable. And I am truly shocked that reviewers didn't notice the horrible acting and pathetic writing. Just watch the first 5 minutes. It's extremely clear this is not a good movie so how did people miss this?","Acting : 3 Camera work : 6 Editing : 5 Budget : 7 Story : 3 Theme : 2 Pure entertainment factor : 4 Video quality : 7 Special effects : 5 Pacing : 6 Suspension disbelief : 2 Non-cringe factor : 2 Lack flashbacks : 7This movie giant mess n't understand trying tell.The hero sister constantly whines South American people hard city people , likely White rich people , take matter hard Mexican immigrants work n't even want get education proper job wo n't matter eyes .

Blue_Beetle,"Blue Beetle is a superhero action movie from Angel Manuel Soto, director of Twelve and La granja.Jaime Reyes (Xolo Maridueña) returns home to his family, but learns that a lot has changed during his college years at home and his family has deteriorated financially. To help his family, he looks for a job, which he tries to find at the wealthy company Kord Industries. Here he comes into contact with Jenny Kord (Bruna Marquezine), who asks him to help her smuggle something out of the company.What Jaime smuggles out turns out to be an alien scarab, which Jaime chooses as a symbiotic host. This is how Jaime turns into the Blue Beetle. Now he must fight Victoria Kord (Susan Sarandon), the boss of Ford Industries, who wanted to use the scarab for her own purpose. To counter the scarab, they try to threaten Jaime and his family, so Jaime as Blue Beetle now has to try to protect his family.This movie was first going to be released on the HBO Max streaming service, but they later decided to release the movie in cinemas anyway. It was also unclear whether this film still belongs to the old DC Extended Universe film series, or at least as the start of the new DC Universe film series, this film series would start. James Gunn, the new CEO of the DC film series, was also growing past this himself at first, but eventually decided that the film would meet as the first film of his new DC film series, because he still wanted to use the character of Blue Beetle at the front of this film series. Despite meeting then anyway for this new movie series, the movie remains much of a standalone with no real further references to other DC movies to come in the future. James Gunn can still remember that.Despite the uncertainty of which film series the film belongs to, the film itself remains a standard, standard superhero film, which does not bring much uniqueness. The movie is good about a Latino superhero, who carries this culture with him. This is something unique for a superhero movie.Furthermore, the film seems to copy more superhero moments from other superhero films. For connoisseurs of this kind of film, the film can come across as a bit unoriginal and it remains on a predictable side without creating real tension.The visual effects are also on the mediocre side with more of the quality you expect to see on a streaming service, which was also the idea for this film. For example, some of the effects appear less spread out.Xolo Maridueña tries to be the main character for as many days as possible, but this is sometimes made difficult for him by the standard quality of the film. Still, just as if he meets the early seasons of the TV series Cobra Kai, he knows how to portray a character that you as a viewer care about. Just like with Cobra Kai when the focus shifts to several different characters, he falls more into the background. Together with the castles, which his other relatives play, they still come across as a family with a Latino culture. Sometimes they just often try to do unnecessary things, while this is not always necessary. The villains in the film also come across as a bit standard as cliché villains from a superhero movie, who have no real good reasons for their evil plans.","Blue Beetle superhero action movie Angel Manuel Soto , director Twelve La granja.Jaime Reyes ( Xolo Maridueña ) returns home family , learns lot changed college years home family deteriorated financially . help family , looks job , tries find wealthy company Kord Industries . comes contact Jenny Kord ( Bruna Marquezine ) , asks help smuggle something company.What Jaime smuggles turns alien scarab , Jaime chooses symbiotic host .

Blue_Beetle,"The individual responsible for churning out this abomination should seriously contemplate a career change, one that involves absolutely no association with the film industry whatsoever. Let's delve into this cinematic catastrophe, shall we? Brace yourself for a litany of lamentation as I dissect every wretched aspect of this atrocity.First and foremost, the plot is an exercise in abject mediocrity. It's as if the screenwriter took a nap halfway through and decided to just roll with the most insipid and uninspired narrative elements possible. The result? A plot so devoid of creativity that even the most dedicated fans of mind-numbing tedium would struggle to find any redeeming qualities.Now, let's talk about the characters - or should I say, the vapid caricatures that grace the screen. These characters are not just your run-of-the-mill dull; they are remarkably, unbelievably, and profoundly stupid. Their actions and decisions defy logic and common sense to such an extent that you'll find yourself questioning the very fabric of reality.The dialogues, if you can even call them that, are about as generic as a cardboard box. It's as if the scriptwriters employed a random word generator to craft the lines, resulting in exchanges so devoid of wit, depth, or originality that you'll be pining for the days of Shakespearean prose.And then we arrive at the acting. Oh, the acting. If you could even call it that. The performances in this travesty of cinema are so wretchedly poor that you'd be forgiven for thinking you stumbled upon a community theater production gone horribly wrong. It's as if the cast was instructed to channel their inner wooden planks, with every emotion delivered in a painfully forced and unconvincing manner.The only semblance of redemption in this cinematic abyss lies in the special effects. I suppose if you're the type of viewer who derives satisfaction from pretty lights and flashy explosions, then congratulations, you've found your silver lining. But even the special effects can't salvage this sinking ship; they merely serve as a shiny distraction from the underlying ineptitude.To liken the acting in this film to that of a ""cheap TV series"" would be an insult to the multitude of talented actors who grace the small screen. No, this is a level of performance that can only be equated to the most bottom-tier, bargain-bin productions, where thespian skills seem to be optional.The entire film feels like a mind-numbing descent into the depths of idiocy. It's as if the creators took inspiration from the lowest quality, brainless cartoons and decided to replicate that asinine formula on the big screen. As the film trudges on, it only becomes increasingly moronic, pushing the boundaries of absurdity and leaving the audience in a state of bewilderment.At some point during this cinematic train wreck, I found myself teetering on the precipice of anger. Yes, anger. Anger at the audacity of subjecting viewers to this festival of imbecility. It's a genuine affront to the intelligence of anyone unfortunate enough to have wasted precious minutes of their life on this abomination.I had such high hopes for ""Blue Beetle,"" but what a colossal letdown it turned out to be. In comparison to this travesty, even the most maligned entries in the DC film universe shine like beacons of cinematic excellence. This film isn't just bad; it's a new benchmark for cinematic incompetence, a testament to the depths to which a movie can sink in its quest to be utterly dreadful.","individual responsible churning abomination seriously contemplate career change , one involves absolutely association film industry whatsoever .

Blue_Beetle,"The next to last DCEU (the Aquaman release is still to come) release currently in theaters. Following the origins of one Jaime Reyes, Xolo Mariduena, as he returns from Gotham City law school to find his family is happy to see him but their own current financial & spiritual straits are up in the air as his dad, Damian Alcazar, is recovering from a heart attack & the family manse is about to be sold from out from under them by the prevalent evil mega-corporation Kord Industries in Palmera City but meeting nice w/the niece, Bruna Marquezine, of its owner, Oscar winner Susan Sarandon, promises Mariduena a job after he came to her defense at their home (he & his sister, Belissa Escobedo, were working as part of the cleaning staff got canned) but when he shows up at Kord HQ he instead gets handed a burger box w/a scarab which he takes home. Showing it off to his family & getting too close to it, causes the object to merge violently into Mariduena's body forming a Guyver like figure which communicates w/him via an internal AI (voiced by singer Becky G) which takes the lead in his use of the suit, since they haven't been fully integrated w/each other. Pissed since she wants to incorporate the tech into battle suits of her own, Sarandon sends out her henchman, Raoul Trujillo (who I remember from Scanners II) to take Mariduena down using any means to his disposal, even going after his family, which results in tragic consequences. Will Mariduena step up & save the day? Fun through & through w/a healthy foothold in the Latin world will make this story, which is very familiar, come alive which unfortunately due to Warner Bros. Ham-fisted handling of their disavowal of the previous DC output continues to paint audiences perceptions if they should venture out to cinemas to watch these things since their emotional investment can be spent elsewhere which is a shame since this film could've done w/Latin fans what Black Panther did for African American ones.

As always, George Lopez played George Lopez as well as he knows how - with the voice of a badger and the personality of a telemarketer calling you on your personal cell at 9 o'clock at night.

Blue_Beetle,"Anyone who follows DC or even comics as a whole, knows how promising of a character Blue Beetle is in the comics-verse. Guy has been a featuring member of Teen Titans for decades, holding his own as one of the coolest drawn characters that has a very interesting backstory regarding an alien symbiote. The character had immense potential to be turned into a promising live-action film-series out of it. And frankly speaking, I think the cast choice was good as well - they could've pulled off the hype. The only thing that ruined this film, however, is the writing. It's terrible - felt so rushed and low-depth at some points that you'd feel like pausing to not continue watching anymore. CGI was bad for some parts too, but that can still be overlooked as most of it gets the job done quite well. But the writing, man, it's awful.

Blue_Beetle,"I had low expectations of this film.I don't ask for much with movies, just for them to be mildly entertaining at minimum and have some heart. All the talk about bad CGI in the likes of The Flash I don't care about so much. I thought that particular movie was fine. Fun, had decent heart and some likeable characters scattered about who are at least trying to do things to move the story forwards.Blue Beetle however, is as bad as things can become I think when it comes to superhero movies. We have seen some terrible entries in the Marvel space recently as well with Thor 4, Dr Strange 2 and Black Panther 2 being very poor. Strange story choices, terrible villains and bad resolutions. In all 3 of those films the main super heroes are almost just background characters and no longer the focus.Blue Beetle is on that terrible level and this film makes even less sense I have to say and again the main superhero is relegated to be less important than he ought to be for some reason.Every character seems so unlikeable, except for the father. The sister talks about taking a big dump at her cleaning job after we first hear how the family struggles financially. Charming. The grandma ends up with a higher kill count than the super hero. The uncle is a computer wizard who drives a big truck but still can't help the family keep their home.This whole family, who can't make end's meet but who can do everything else when it suits the story just doesn't work in a superhero film. It is not convincing. Story wise I think it is fine/good if they can be there for support and guidance. But to physically take over I think is a crazy approach that doesn't land well at all, especially when the best person out of that bunch is the one who dies before all that takes off.After the father's death the family straight away uses all the abandoned (supposedly) Blue Beetle related gear as in a sort of kitted out ready to go endless Batcave supply. But then we also find out the original Blue Beetle host who that all belong to is still alive in the mid credits scene? Why are we doing any of this? It is all so dumb and never focuses on what the current Blue Beetle superhero could do for humanity.Susan Sarandon, as the baddie, phones in her performance to make things worse. An utterly pointless villain who has some vague mission to make her robot army more of a robot army with the Blue Beetle scarab thing.Furthermore, early on, we find out that the Blue Beetle suit / scarab that gets fused with our hero's body can actually run on auto pilot. So what is the reason to keep the host conscious in that case? The suit seems to make better decisions early on whilst the host succeeds in convincing it to stop it from killing baddies, who then when still alive cause his father's heart attack and death.Compare that badly thought out drivel to the excellent story in the original Superman movie where Superman can't save his father from a heart attack death. He has all these powers but couldn't do that. Reality sinks in and it makes him more determined. There is no such character arc here at all.I didn't like any of what was presented in Blue Beetle story wise or character wise. There isn't 1 thing I can tell you I liked.There have been far better small budget movies this year that should have enjoyed more popularity over this endless superhero nonsense in which we constantly have to put up with lower quality story telling and horrible characters. Some good films I saw recently this year that may have gone unnoticed are: Talk to Me & Sisu. If you're after a big movie go see Gran Turismo.Look for those and give this tripe a miss.It has not been a bad year for movies I think and this hopefully is as low as it can go cinema wise.","low expectations film.I n't ask much movies , mildly entertaining minimum heart . talk bad CGI likes Flash n't care much . thought particular movie fine .

Blue_Beetle,"Let's get the positives out of the way first. The musical score is pretty good, although not up to the normal DC standards for music. There are a couple of cool action moments. Half of the comedic attempts made me laugh. And I loved the intro artwork/music, it got me excited.The bad... sigh. Blue Beetle is fairly boring and had difficulty getting me invested. The majority feels generic with nearly everything having been seen in other superhero movies. The one it seemed to copy the most is Shang-Chi. Numerous aspects are nearly identical. Like the zany sister who never stops talking and gets him into trouble. It's the same character that Awkwafina plays. They even steal jokes from it. I knew the joke was coming because I had already seen it in Shang-Chi.But the biggest problem with this movie is that the protagonist doesn't drive the plot. Things happen TO him, not BECAUSE of him. And he is saved by something or someone an absurd number of times. It becomes laughable and makes it difficult to root for him.To make it worse, we have the stock-est of all stock villains. She's played by veteran actress Susan Sarandon. Not only was this a terrible casting choice, she gives an atrocious performance. Her line delivery is cringe. It doesn't help that the dialogue is terrible.I mentioned that half the comedic attempts made me laugh. The other half are awful. They were either cheesy or fully predictable. I knew exactly what would happen or what the punch line would be.This movie is also extremely dumb. It's mostly small stuff that can be ignored if it happens once or twice. But it happens 100 times, no exaggeration. I'll give an example. The enemy starts shooting at his friends. Rather than stopping the enemy who is right next to him, he turns around and runs towards his friends. Why? To yell, ""you guys need to get out of here."" It's just bad writing.I have no allegiance to DC or Marvel, but I truly feel sad for the die-hard DC fans. They continue to receive bad movies and have to watch as the once endless potential of the Snyderverse is thrown away.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 8/17/2023)","Let 's get positives way first . musical score pretty good , although normal DC standards music . couple cool action moments .

Blue_Beetle,"A real disappointment. The creators had a ""message"" they wanted to hammer home, and there was this mildly interesting story they decided to hide the propaganda in.The execution had promise, especially with the excellent reactions of the lead actor to being the unwitting/unwilling recipient of a forced integration with the alien life form (think...a nicer version of ""Venom"").Lots of laughs there, but they kept hammering the propaganda into any gap in the CGI action. You know, all the evul white peoples keeping the saintly People of Color down. Because all the people of color were either unappreciated (and unexplained) geniuses, Saints-in-Training, or the Oppressed with Hearts of Gold. Meanwhile the forces of Darkness were part of the white power structure that owned the courts and the police, and were even (SURPRISE SPOILER!) responsible for creating the villain's henchmen.Who could have seen that coming?Man, it was stupid. To say nothing of how the dipshit uncle character (a fitfully funny George Lopez, when the script allowed it) could control an aging superhero's all purposed vehicle just because he was another one of the story's ""Magical Latinos"" and the writers/director were too stupid or lazy to come up with even a minimally logical reason to explain why.Also, the Hero/villian CGI designs owed a LOT to Transformers...they should really cut Michael Bay a check for his stolen creative input.","real disappointment . creators `` message '' wanted hammer home , mildly interesting story decided hide propaganda in.The execution promise , especially excellent reactions lead actor unwitting/unwilling recipient forced integration alien life form ( think ... nicer version `` Venom '' ) .Lots laughs , kept hammering propaganda gap CGI action . know , evul white peoples keeping saintly People Color . people color either unappreciated ( unexplained ) geniuses , Saints-in-Training , Oppressed Hearts Gold .

Blue_Beetle,"My Reaction / Review for Blue Beetle (2023): So Jaime's family is about to lose the house? That sucks. Jaime looks like a very humble guy, I like that. Wait so it was that easy to steal the scarab? Wow, the first time that the scarab connects to Jaime it looks like a freaking horror movie. Why did he have to cut that bus in half, the scarab could easily avoid it, that's very dangerous with so many people in it. The scenes where the scarab gets activated for the first time were pretty fun. Rudy is a bit too much, its like he is screaming for some reason in every scene. So the uncle has some super tech that messes with the electronics and cameras? How convenient.Also they go to Kord industries and there is no serucity or anything? That's dumb. Wait so Carapax has a scarab too or some other technology? First hour is decent, a 6.8/10 I would say, let's see if it gets better or worse. Wow there is no way to get rid of the scarab, its for life, that's kinda cool but at the same time it sucks. The dad is dead? Now its personal. Damn the dad's death made me emotional. Many times they talk in spanish, I would really appreciate some english subtitles but there are none... So now Rudy knows how to fly a spaceship? That's ridiculouus, this man can do anything the plot wants.So now the grandma joins the fight? Cant take this seriously. And now the grandma shot three soldiers, so cringey and ridiculous. The 2nd half is so bad so far. The villain(s) in this movie are so not interesting. OK here is my conclusion. The movie is not bad but it is not great. The whole family thing was too much at some point, the humor is mostly bad, the dialogue could be better, the action scenes mediocre. The only thing I liked was Jaime's character.

Blue_Beetle,"Another DC failure. Thought I was hoodwinked into believing it was for adults when really the audience aimed at were 10-12 years of age. Childish, utterly child-like in its storyline.Stereo-typed Mexicans made out to be annoying and stupid. Maybe while the US doesn't want them to be citizens if we go by this story.

Blue_Beetle,"This is a new low for the genre. This movie has zero original thought and they try to hide it in a near offensive level of Hispanic stereotypes.Not all Hispanics are poor, nor do we somehow resent white people if we are. I don't constantly sing and dancin. I don't have a crazy uncle with a truck named ""Taco"".Get it!!! Taco Truck!!! That hysterical, said nobody...Seriously the only stereotype missing is the 4ft crucifix on the wall. A joke perfectly pulled off by the late Matthey Perry in the movie Fool's Rush In.And unfortunately there is Race Baiting. Intentionally mispronouncing of Jamie's name. A baddie (Susan Sarandon) who intentionally calls her Hispanic worker by the wrong names. A reference to a grandmother being a guerilla rebel fighting white imperialists for no reason except to explain her being able to use a belt fed cannon like Jesse Ventura in Predator...Nothing but pieced together but of other superhero movies. Leaning heavily on Iron Man and Spiderman.I almost want to cheer the inclusion of O. M. A. C., an obscure comic that I used to read. Untill I saw that what was a living breathing character wast turned into yet another cybernetic soilder suit.Iron Man 3 anyone???Then the made the OMAC suit a inexcusable copy of Maximilian from The Black Hole.

Blue_Beetle,"Blue Beetle isn't one of the well known DC characters. My only experience with him was from the Young Justice cartoons, which was positive. Blue Beetle is another DC superhero movie failure. A Latino superhero movie that was predictable, had uninspiring characters, a weak, boring villain, and a movie that played too much on Latino stereotypes. This could have been an inspiring Latino superhero movie that many could have related to and enjoyed instead it became a jumbled, boring, amateurish mess. No, even Nana couldn't save this mess of movie. The sad part is that the 2 leads seem to have amazing chemistry together based on their rounds of promotions. But have none in the actual movie. And based on the quality of the movie, it should have been direct to Max not worthy of a theatrical release. How many poorly made DC/WB movies can be made?

Talk_to_Me,"Trust me. I've watched more than four decades of diverse horror films. The genre is nothing new to me. This is a supernatural horror film about an embalmed hand that is further preserved by encasing it in a ceramic material.Rumor has it that the hand belonged to a psychic and if you held on to the hand and uttered some key words it would make contact with you while you drifted into a trance. While in the trance like state, you would lose total control of your body.This then is the horror element of the film. You try watching films like The Legend Of Hell House(1973), The Changeling(1980), Fear No Evil(1981), Poltergeist(1982) and you see how mediocre this genre has turned over the years...Absolutely the worst casting I have ever seen. The film seems to me catered for a select audience and will not appeal to veteran horror buffs who grew up watching 70's, 80's and 90's horror classics.Nothing to recommend here and also don't expect a gritty climax to a movie made on a shoe-string budget I hear.","Trust .

But most people probably don't know that there's an entire genre of Australian cinema depicting disturbing things. About ten or so years ago I saw an Aussie neo-noir thriller called ""The Square"", about a tryst that spins out of control. More recently, the land down under gave us ""The Babadook"", about a horrific being that escapes from a child's book.Well, now we have an Aussie movie about demonic possession. This one features some teens who discover that an embalmed hand can enable them to communicate with spirits. Sure enough, the game goes too far, and the terror isn't going away for one girl. ""Talk to Me"" isn't simply a slasher movie; there are graphic scenes of self-harm. Quite the opposite of the pristine image that we have of Australia.This is the sort of movie that the fainthearted should avoid at all costs.

This is immensely cliche. And as such you need to do something special with it, and you need to find some angle or extra to make it stand out, but no. This is just a cliche as you might think. No thought process whatsoever.Secondly this is amateurish. Everything is. This looks like, feels like and is acted like a middle-school project made by failing drama students. I could get behind some of that, horror does not need to have a huge cgi budget, but it cannot be amateurish on all levels, on all things.Thirdly, is this actually a horror movie? The premiss is boring and cliche, and there is nothing really scary or weird or thought-provoking about this. And the ending? Omg... so predictable that if you did not see that coming, I am sorry, but if so you need a doctor.I cannot find any redeeming traits or positives about this.

Talk_to_Me,"Talk To Me, the debut movie from Aussie directors Danny and Michael Philippou (the men behind popular YouTube channel RackaRacka), feels more Blumhouse than it does A24, and as far as I am concerned that's a good thing. It's far less pretentious and arthouse than I had expected, and a lot less boring.Sophie Wilde plays Mia, who attends a party where her friends dabble with the occult, using a porcelain hand that has the power to connect the living with the dead: all a person has to do is hold the hand and say 'Talk to me'. The important thing to remember is not to hold on for longer than 90 seconds. Of course, Mia does just that, leaving the door wide open for unwelcome spirits to come a-visiting.A likeable cast, plenty of creepiness, a smidge of uncomfortable brutality (the standout scenes involving some nasty self harm), and a neat ending ensure that Talk To Me is a thoroughly entertaining ride from start to finish. Sure, some characters make questionable choices in the film, but that is par for the course for a teen horror, and it doesn't detract too much from the fun. Was I scared?

Talk_to_Me,"The opening scene was the strongest part of the movie, it is shocking and instantly grabs your attention. However, that energy doesn't carry over to the rest of the film.This is an example of an idea outweighing its execution. The concept of the embalmed hand used to conjure spirits was unique but aside from that this film doesn't do anything special. The main character grieves the loss of her mother and wishes to connect with her so she uses the hand to do so. This film reminded me a bit of ""Insidious Chapter 3"" but it wasn't as good. There is only one other scene besides the opening scene that has any kind of tension or suspense. This film lacked atmospheric horror as well as jump scares. There wasn't even anything creepy about the spirits that were conjured.The origin of the embalmed hand wasn't concrete as some characters had different stories as to where the hand came from. It would have been nice if they just picked an idea and stuck with it.The development of every single character in this movie was bare bones. The main character was grieving her mother and didn't have a good relationship with her father. Her father was made to seem like he had an important role in the film but he didn't. She had a best friend who had a little brother and a boyfriend. The dynamics between all of those characters are very cliché and corny.This film was a waste of time and a complete let down.

Talk_to_Me,"""Talk to Me"" is a debut from the Phillipou brothers under A24 that takes the oft-visited possession horror subgenre into some new territory whilst setting and consistently maintaining an eerie and disturbing tone. The depiction of modern Australian teenage culture felt a bit too ""down with the kids"" and drawn out at times, but generally came across well with its application of slang and contemporary cultural references that very much brought the setting into the present day. There is a blend of psychological horror, jump scares, shock horror, and gore. Meaning most dimensions of human fear are attended to, creating a robust horror ensemble. The only problem is it doesn't entirely sustain these strengths into its second half. You could say it had me in the first half.Subtle use of sound and camera work felt very much borrowed from the same vein as ""Hereditary"" which is never a bad thing. Downright bizarre and inconceivable scenes regularly caught the audience off-guard and an unforgiving atmosphere of the unexpected and uneasy meant nothing felt ""off the table"". Characters setting a sense of control and predictability were soon overturned in horrifying fashion.As said before, about halfway through the film the novelty of the ""hand"" concept wore thin, and the film ran out of momentum. This was later redeemed with a great, thought-provoking ending that leads the viewer's imagination beyond the film. You could call this, in some sense, the ""Inception"" of horror films; once you watch it you'll understand why it could be described as such.7.5/10.","`` Talk '' debut Phillipou brothers A24 takes oft-visited possession horror subgenre new territory whilst setting consistently maintaining eerie disturbing tone . depiction modern Australian teenage culture felt bit `` kids '' drawn times , generally came across well application slang contemporary cultural references much brought setting present day . blend psychological horror , jump scares , shock horror , gore .

Talk_to_Me,"I had someone literally barrage me in text form about this movie, telling me how it's the most perfect film, how it has kept them up late at night and that they can't shake it. I feel badly because I hate that I knew that I'd instantly judge this movie as a result and that I didn't see the version of this movie that they did.What I did see was fine - and let me make fun of myself, if it were shot on video in 1983 or was made by an Italian special effects artist in 1985 then distributed by Filmirage, I would have probably loved it a lot more, such is my madness - but at no moment did I lose a moment's rest. That said, it does have some wild eye-related destruction and no small amount of gore. But it owes so much of itself to a computer-guided camera move that will seem as quaint as morphing in a few years. Directed by Danny and Michael Philippou (Danny also wrote the script with Daley Pearson and Bill Hinzman and no, that isn't the maker of Flesheater no matter how much I want it to be), it revolves around a severed hand that allows people to see visions. The kids think it's like drugs; as you can imagine, none of them have watched as many possession and occult movies as you or I, so they open the door to something horrible, as you do.Mia (Sophie Wilde) is struggling with the death of her mother after an overdose and her father Max doesn't help because he's never been there and he's since grown more distant. One night, she and her friend Jade (Alexandra Jensen) and Jade's little brother Riley (Joe Bird) sneak out to a party hosted by Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and Joss (Chris Alosio). There, Mia holds the hand - ninety seconds only is the rule - and is shocked by the way that it makes her feel. Yeah, it's like drugs. And you want more once you taste it.The next night, they are joined by even more people and Jade refuses to allow the younger James and her brother Riley to try the hand. Mia, however, lets them use it when Jade leaves and Riley is possessed by Mia's mother, trying to apologize to her. She disregards the time limit, which causes Riley to become overtaken and repeatedly slams his face into everything around himself, becoming so suicidal that he becomes a burden on his family, only able to survive in a coma.Mia has taken the hand and keeps using it, discovering that Riley is in limbo being tortured, but she still needs to talk to her mother, even if the spirits begin to destroy her grasp on reality. Twist ending to wrap it all up and there you go.Samantha Jennings, one of the co-founders of production company Causeway Films, produced this. She also was behind The Babadook, another movie that people tell me that I'd love. They were worse than right. Oh baby, they were wrong (sorry, I tried the hand and got possessed by the demonic form of Robert Evans).There's also a sequel - Talk 2 Me - and a prequel that is all on social media and screens coming out. Like all modern horror, this feels like a way of dealing with grief and that's fine. I'm sure for some this really worked and like I said, I wish I could enjoy it without realizing everything several beats ahead.

Talk_to_Me,"Trust me. I've watched more than four decades of diverse horror films. The genre is nothing new to me. This is a supernatural horror film about an embalmed hand that is further preserved by encasing it in a ceramic material.Rumor has it that the hand belonged to a psychic and if you held on to the hand and uttered some key words it would make contact with you while you drifted into a trance. While in the trance like state, you would lose total control of your body.This then is the horror element of the film. You try watching films like The Legend Of Hell House(1973), The Changeling(1980), Fear No Evil(1981), Poltergeist(1982) and you see how mediocre this genre has turned over the years...Absolutely the worst casting I have ever seen. The film seems to me catered for a select audience and will not appeal to veteran horror buffs who grew up watching 70's, 80's and 90's horror classics.Nothing to recommend here and also don't expect a gritty climax to a movie made on a shoe-string budget I hear.","Trust .

Talk_to_Me,"When a group of kids get together under the thumb of the rather odious ""Hayley"" (Zoe Terakes) they are presented with a ceramic hand - that apparently encases a real one - that acts as a portal to a dimension in which live the dead. They have discovered that no harm can be done if they stick to a time limit, exceed that - and well they are in virgin and potentially perilous territory. Following on from her best friend ""Jade"" (Alexandra Jensen) who has a go, it falls to ""Mia"" (Sophie Wilde) and after the most bizarre of personally traumatic connections, she is soon addicted to the experience and is also soon providing a conduit that is causing havoc within their group - not least for poor young ""Riley"" (Joe Bird) who ends up needing danger money - and a soft play area! Wilde does quite well here and though the rest of the acting isn't really up to much, the story has an originality to it that genuinely creates a new avenue for a genre that has been really suffering from same old, same old storytelling of late. Bird is by far the star here - even if he is incapacitated for much of it, and the aforementioned Terakes creates a character I'd cheerfully throttle. There's too much dialogue and it's very very score-heavy which did annoy after a while, but it's at times quite scary and definitely worth a watch around Halloween on the telly.","group kids get together thumb rather odious `` Hayley '' ( Zoe Terakes ) presented ceramic hand - apparently encases real one - acts portal dimension live dead . discovered harm done stick time limit , exceed - well virgin potentially perilous territory .

Talk_to_Me,"I just watched a low budget Aussie movie that made it all the way to the US Sundance Film Festival in the Egyptian Theatre...not a bad feat for twins from OZ.This 94 minute Horror, Thriller, Supernatural First Feature Film for the RackaRacka brothers, Danny & Michael Phillipou was a true family affair, even roping in their sister Helene as a possessed person in the online videos.Before making this debut movie they already had over 1.5 billion views and 6.5 million subscribers on YouTube and other social media channels for their crazy ""Jackass"" style videos they've been making since they were children...sometime featuring a facsimile of Ronald McDonald.The young acting talent in front of the camera includes Sophie Wilde.She has proven herself as a leading actress (""The Portable Door"") to carry this movie on her tiny shoulders as ""Mia"" because she is in nearly every scene and makes a brilliant transition from beginning to ending.Zoe Terakes (""Wentworth"", ""Nine Perfect Strangers"") as ""Hayley"" starts the whole ball rolling by gathering all her friends to a seance with a difference.Her friend (Chris Alosio) as ""Joss"" constantly carries with him the creepy hand in his back pack...no snacks or drinks just a mummified hand and candle kit.In this supernatural experience each person must hold the embalmed and plastered hand of a dead spiritualist and literally talk to the hand as they utter the words ""Talk To Me"" then invite the spirit they raise into them to be possessed for no more than 90 seconds.A candle is lit at the beginning of the deadly ceremony and blown out at the end to conclude the session, if not the dead remain on our side.It's a spooky premise that's not entirely original, but it works surprisingly well.The horror and jump scares will keep you awake and maybe even give you nightmares.The on screen violence will force you to navel gaze momentarily to avoid the ugliness on more than one occasion.Youngest actor on set Joe Bird as ""Riley"" plays in a coma for most of the movie.Alexandra Jensen as ""Jade"" plays his big sister.Miranda Otto, from an Aussie acting dynasty, is their mother, ""Sue"".The director's produced ""Talk To Me"" themselves by securing investors who believed in them and the project rather than letting the story get lost in the Hollywood grist mill.This meant fighting to keep Aussie actors, accents, shooting in Adelaide, South Australia and more without diluting the product and something getting lost in translation as so often happens.It was a gamble that cost them dearly, but paid off in the end after Sundance, because big production companies were crawling over themselves to get the brothers to sign on the dotted line for distribution deals.A24 won out in the end over other major players to wet the ink and put ""Talk To Me"" into 2000 screens in the US alone!""Talk To Me"" is one of the most successful debut feature horror films since ""Saw"" for our other famous Aussie horror exports James Wan & Leigh Wanell.It's also way better than anything they've created lately.It's got a distinctly Jordan Peele (""Get Out"", ""Nope"")vibe in its cinematography and I say that in a good way.This movie even caught his attention.The opening scene will shock you to your core.There is no turning back once you've seen ""Talk To Me"".It reminded me of ""The Babadook"" with good reason...Causeway Films' producers also collaborated on ""Talk To Me"".Warning: Do not try this at home kids.I""Talk To Me"" has got a fight on its hands (pardon the pun) during this period known jokingly as Barbenheimer.Thanks to the success of both ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" putting up the full house signs, but if you wanna see something scary this should

I don't need to be left with nightmares for it to be enjoyable. Just give me that rush of being caught off guard.

Talk_to_Me,"When a group of kids get together under the thumb of the rather odious ""Hayley"" (Zoe Terakes) they are presented with a ceramic hand - that apparently encases a real one - that acts as a portal to a dimension in which live the dead. They have discovered that no harm can be done if they stick to a time limit, exceed that - and well they are in virgin and potentially perilous territory. Following on from her best friend ""Jade"" (Alexandra Jensen) who has a go, it falls to ""Mia"" (Sophie Wilde) and after the most bizarre of personally traumatic connections, she is soon addicted to the experience and is also soon providing a conduit that is causing havoc within their group - not least for poor young ""Riley"" (Joe Bird) who ends up needing danger money - and a soft play area! Wilde does quite well here and though the rest of the acting isn't really up to much, the story has an originality to it that genuinely creates a new avenue for a genre that has been really suffering from same old, same old storytelling of late. Bird is by far the star here - even if he is incapacitated for much of it, and the aforementioned Terakes creates a character I'd cheerfully throttle.

Talk_to_Me,"I just watched a low budget Aussie movie that made it all the way to the US Sundance Film Festival in the Egyptian Theatre...not a bad feat for twins from OZ.This 94 minute Horror, Thriller, Supernatural First Feature Film for the RackaRacka brothers, Danny & Michael Phillipou was a true family affair, even roping in their sister Helene as a possessed person in the online videos.Before making this debut movie they already had over 1.5 billion views and 6.5 million subscribers on YouTube and other social media channels for their crazy ""Jackass"" style videos they've been making since they were children...sometime featuring a facsimile of Ronald McDonald.The young acting talent in front of the camera includes Sophie Wilde.She has proven herself as a leading actress (""The Portable Door"") to carry this movie on her tiny shoulders as ""Mia"" because she is in nearly every scene and makes a brilliant transition from beginning to ending.Zoe Terakes (""Wentworth"", ""Nine Perfect Strangers"") as ""Hayley"" starts the whole ball rolling by gathering all her friends to a seance with a difference.Her friend (Chris Alosio) as ""Joss"" constantly carries with him the creepy hand in his back pack...no snacks or drinks just a mummified hand and candle kit.In this supernatural experience each person must hold the embalmed and plastered hand of a dead spiritualist and literally talk to the hand as they utter the words ""Talk To Me"" then invite the spirit they raise into them to be possessed for no more than 90 seconds.A candle is lit at the beginning of the deadly ceremony and blown out at the end to conclude the session, if not the dead remain on our side.It's a spooky premise that's not entirely original, but it works surprisingly well.The horror and jump scares will keep you awake and maybe even give you nightmares.The on screen violence will force you to navel gaze momentarily to avoid the ugliness on more than one occasion.Youngest actor on set Joe Bird as ""Riley"" plays in a coma for most of the movie.Alexandra Jensen as ""Jade"" plays his big sister.Miranda Otto, from an Aussie acting dynasty, is their mother, ""Sue"".The director's produced ""Talk To Me"" themselves by securing investors who believed in them and the project rather than letting the story get lost in the Hollywood grist mill.This meant fighting to keep Aussie actors, accents, shooting in Adelaide, South Australia and more without diluting the product and something getting lost in translation as so often happens.It was a gamble that cost them dearly, but paid off in the end after Sundance, because big production companies were crawling over themselves to get the brothers to sign on the dotted line for distribution deals.A24 won out in the end over other major players to wet the ink and put ""Talk To Me"" into 2000 screens in the US alone!""Talk To Me"" is one of the most successful debut feature horror films since ""Saw"" for our other famous Aussie horror exports James Wan & Leigh Wanell.It's also way better than anything they've created lately.It's got a distinctly Jordan Peele (""Get Out"", ""Nope"")vibe in its cinematography and I say that in a good way.This movie even caught his attention.The opening scene will shock you to your core.There is no turning back once you've seen ""Talk To Me"".It reminded me of ""The Babadook"" with good reason...Causeway Films' producers also collaborated on ""Talk To Me"".Warning: Do not try this at home kids.I""Talk To Me"" has got a fight on its hands (pardon the pun) during this period known jokingly as Barbenheimer.Thanks to the success of both ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" putting up the full house signs, but if you wanna see something scary this should satisfy that hunger.Content creators are now making feature movies...enjoy this unsettling, urban legend with a cautionary tale & allegory to drug abuse.","watched low budget Aussie movie made way US

Talk_to_Me,"I am a huge horror fan and have no problem watching even a subpar horror film, especially in October.Very rarely does a film come out that I'm legitimately excited for though.With its strong rating, I thought Talk to Me would really give me an experience to remember.As a horror fan I love the thrill of adrenaline from something truly terrifying... or it could be interesting if it has great comedic energy mixed with some sharp jump scares. I don't need to be left with nightmares for it to be enjoyable. Just give me that rush of being caught off guard. This is a subjective point of view, but, to me a scary movie should entertain through thrills over drama... and when they do I am delighted!So maybe if I expected a new experience that would make me giddy with fright I have only myself to blame. Not everyone has my taste.Sometimes a film comes that doesn't meet my standards but is otherwise not technically ""bad"" in the way that really bad horror movies are.

No glaringly offensive faults but after the first act it does become pretty predictable and poorly paced.Oh, and it's also not very scary. Or fun

Talk_to_Me,"LIKES:The Pace/time of the movie
-It's dark material and it has a lot of thought, so a compact time limit helps weather the dark storm for this reviewer.-Talk to me takes the gas and give it all with the right momentum to keep things interesting, but never dipping into the too heavy a territory to get boring or typical.-And keeping that pace helps to blunt some of the elevated thoughts that A24 sometimes gets stuck with.The Film Filters:
-A horror movie is only as good as the feeling it establishes, and in this case Talk To Me is a winner.-The film is shot in this grey filter, dreary, depressing, and haunting that works perfectly with the material they are presenting.-It helps add this ambience of the looming horror, but also contributes to the psych issues that come with it as well, really amplifying the true scare facto of this movie.-And then taking into account the cinematography, the movie just hits all the right shots to sell the story and leave you with a sense of unease when it is all done.The Makeup/Visuals:
-A good movie requires good support of costumes and makeup to make the creatures come out and memorable.-The spirits of this world are horrifying. Maybe not to the traditional Insidious like demons and maladies, but this one takes the realism and really conveys the gross state of decay that these beings are in.-Certain moments really convey that horrible mode, and I can't help but appreciate the nightmare inducing images that these ghosts are. A true A24 vision brought to life.-But even the injuries that occur have this authenticity to it, and the seizure modes are animalistic and unnatural that are realistic to a level beyond our understanding.Acting:
-It's not the best performance or most unique, but damn can these young actors act.-Talk to me takes the teenager spirit and takes it to a level that was relevant, deeper, and yet the typical fodder you find in these movies.-I won't mention most of the first billed, because their part in this movie is limited, but they play the parts well and convey the message of this story.-Sophie Wilde is the lead I'll talk about. The Australian actress has her niche in the horror world, and does it so good. She's got a vulnerability that works well, but this attitude that helps balance it, leading to an impressive character to follow.Alexandra Jensen as the best friend is that role that I thought was going to annoy me, but really meshes well with the drama aspect and handles the stupidity of the others quite well.Joe Bird is talented if not a bit quite, but once the movie gets started, the potential for some very powerful roles come out, alongside a manner that gives him range for potential roles.-The cast works together so well, and this frightened band of teenagers gives you some hopes, but some concern as they continue to solve the mystery at hand.The Story:
-It's predictable at times, but the unique aspect of the Monkey's paw so to speak works as a medium that really helps ground, but mesh the two well.-Talk to Me uses this simplistic device to elevate, and by having such a closed portal keeps the film's antagonist delivering, while also helping hit other parts of the movie quite well.-Outside of the usual specters of ghost stories, this movie does the internal antagonism well, a constant battle of struggling to determine what is going on with them.-Add some touching moments, a little character struggle, and some actual realistic approaches and mix it with the haunting element, and again you have a victory for me in this department.-The movie really makes this ghost story feel terrifying to that degree, not so much in the jumping and scaring tactics, but more so in the unsettling ease that that goes with it.The Ending:
-I won't spoil anything, but Talk to Me is one of those that does an elevated horror ending quite well at least in terms of some balance.-One level it's a metaphor with great use of theatrical elements. A piece that holds so many levels of moral battling that it leave it a bit ambiguous as to what will happen up until the decision.-Then you get the story elements and the symbology that it serves, not so lost in the art to be open ended and super vague to give you closure, and a closure that leave an imprint in your mind.-It all comes down to being a fitting ending and I like that in a movie that can handle art and storytelling and find middle ground, which I felt it did.Dislikes:Predictable:
-I had most of the movie down pretty quickly, so I anticipate others might be able to figure out where the movie is going.-A few twists help try to throw you aside, but I found that most of the foreshadowing in the first thirty minutes should give you enough to determine the ending.Perhaps a Bit Too Dark?-A24 should have a warning for most of its films in that the darkness may be too much for many people, including parts of myself.-One part is the sheer horror and realism, with vibes that go down perhaps too personal of levels, so caution if you are prone to PTSD with realistic events.-Second, A24's desire to put people in the nude that aren't the most stunning is still prevalent and that did little for me other than stir my nausea.-Third the movie has one moment that makes no sense until the end, but there was so much better use than once more sowing me an animal needlessly suffering. Dragging it out, adding little use, there were better ways to accomplish it.-And crossing my rules of boundaries, I don't enjoy that, so it loses points for me.More character development:
-Simply put, the movie starts off well, but the other characters could have worked better to help the others. Maybe add a little more attempts to discern the mental quality and finish polishing things up.-Great characters could have been more, but then that would have taken more time and more time dwelling in the dark might not have been good given how this movie might leave people feeling.The VERDICT:
Talk to me is a weird movie, but it lives to the usual caliber of A24 in elevating a movie series to a new level to help add freshness to the movie. Or something like that. The movie works in establishing creepy feelings, horror that sticks with you and a story that will certainly remain ingrained in the mind. It takes the familiar genre and helps condense the horrors to a logical plot, while exploring character traits that help mix up things while still feeling familiar. With a talented cast, characters who are a tad more developed, and elements that blend together to be a real horror movie, it certainly does stick out as one of the more unique and disturbing horror movies of the bunch. However, more time with the characters, a little more mystery and involvement to help mix things up, ad toning back some of the more disturbing elements could have helped this movie more to really be the wow factor they were shooting with this movie. Thus, my review leaves a score of:Horror/Thriller: 8.0

Talk_to_Me,"YouTube comic horror sensations, twin brothers Danny and Michael Philippou, crash into mainstream films by way of progressive film company A24, with a half-dead kangaroo and a haunted hand opening that gains immediate attention in Talk to Me. From there the film titillates by a series of shocks as good as it gets with seasoned filmmakers like Sam Raimi.Not yet done with this tour de force opening, the camera tracks a young man to a locked door at a party that should have stopped hours ago as he breaks down the door and extricates his younger brother, who was long ago freaked out in a probable encounter with the haunted hand, which will be introduced at said party shortly.The hand at the party is a connection to the macabre past, and it won't leave if someone holds it longer than 90 seconds. Of course, a callow teen will do that, ensuring that the hand can do its dirty work for the rest of the party and beyond. As metaphor, the hand serves as a reminder that evil doings can grab hold and never let go until said dumb teen gets taken away into a spiritual realm where former corpses act like zombies only a bit uglier.For those not making the final journey but experiencing the hand, their faces transform briefly into ghouls while their dilated eyes promise hell behind. Of course, the spectators howl with delight while filming for social media. That's what bored teen do in ultra-cool horror films, especially helped by Emma Bortignon's classic horror sound designGradually Mia (Sophie Wilde) takes over the struggle against the spirits, grappling with such phantasms as her deceased mother, or is it really she? Relentlessly Mia tries to defeat the micro possessions that come for her because she has stayed overtime, and repeatedly, dealing with her mother's alleged suicide.While the mayhem winds down, the film succeeds in showing grief can terrorize lives as it gets hold of inner fears and regrets.

Talk_to_Me,"Hello again please read this review and save yourself the HUGE let down I experienced in watching this LAME film. Once again I am totally dumbstruck by what people today call 'scary'. This film didn't even give me chills ONCE! I love all great horror from the original night of the living dead to the conjuring movies(1 & 2 at least). This film doesn't just fail at being a decent horror movie but it completely fails outright as a basic film! Firstly the characters are TERRIBLE! They all have ZERO likability and just keep on making DUMB choices throughout! The script itself seems like it was written by a 10 year old with cringey humour and just outright bad dialogue with zero logic! The story is all over the place trying to find an actual point to justify its existence. The film is so dull I actually started writing this review an hour into it and just let it continue to give me ammo to hate it! If I'm coming across a bit angry it's because I LOVE HORROR movies and I HATE keep getting my hopes up about the new films everyone raves are the ""best new horror film"" and then I am left scratching my head wondering what the heck was supposed to be good about them! Seriously there is literally nothing to like about this film, the complete lack of story, the complete lack of likeable characters, the COMPLETE LACK of scares??!! I just wish people who knew nothing about decent horror would STOP making these lame films! Seriously are we supposed to be scared about rotting dead people? Is that what the point is and that's why I don't get it? Even when the film starts to make you think it has a point(saving a child who's been possessed) it then completely forgets this and ends in a really stupid illogical way! Ok I'm gunna stop now and hope my high blood pressure has proven to you TRUE horror fans out there to pass this one by, honestly any TRUE horror fan will only enjoy how easy this film is to scoff at. A friend once said to me, ""usually when all the critics and mainstream fans rave about a new film stating ""the best new 'genre' film yet!"" it is usually a BAD sign, and oh boy is this lame film ""the worst new horror film yet!"". I SO WANTED TO LOVE THIS FILM but honestly, there is nothing to love or even remotely like about any of it. The only thing I am actually HAPPY about......I didnt have to pay to watch it thankfully and now will also be cancelling my preordered steelbook because once again I fell for the clearly bought for hype for this boring snooze fest. I will say I can't wait to hear what my mate thinks of it as he like myself is proper horror fan and again like myself he is stupidly excited to see ""the new best horror movie!"" Lol! Thanks for listening to me rant and I pray it saves you all an hour and a half of your life you will never get back!

Not scary at all though.It's an interesting concept and story, but underdeveloped by a large margin. The initial premise that random kids have such an object is ridiculous by itself.My main problem with this movie that it's first half is just boring. Most of the characters are also quite annoying, which doesn't help feel you invested in them. There was almost no feeling of tension and there were little significant scares.

Talk_to_Me,"I had pretty high hopes for this movie. I like A24 films usually, and the first 20 minutes had a couple freaky parts that I enjoyed.Then unfortunately it was back to extremely long and extremely boring reaction shots, and completely overblown sounds. (Pillows hitting a person sounded like a concrete block being dropped onto the sidewalk, and a girl slapping her head 15 times that made my eardrums blow out.)The ""spirits"" she first saw were pretty damn scary, but then it just devolved into typical ""dead person"" makeup and cloudy eyes. Along with just gross-out gore which isn't very scary. Really ended up disappointed overall. The concept was pretty cool and they could have done a lot with it (contacting spirits as a viral trend), but they really dropped the ball.And of course you could see the ending coming a mile away.","pretty high hopes movie . like A24 films usually , first 20 minutes couple freaky parts enjoyed.Then unfortunately back extremely long extremely boring reaction shots , completely overblown sounds .

Talk_to_Me,"I'll start with positives. The film was shot really well so credit to cinematographer Aaron McLisky and his team for their efforts.Both practical and special effects were top quality throughout, I never felt anything looked fake. The makeup was actually very effective with the spirits and with the whole Riley incident. Particularly when he injures himself and the scenes subsequently where he is in the hospital are well done. He does look battered and bruised in a gruesome way. Finally, I thought the acting throughout was also good, I can't knock that at all, but there are significant issues, and it's all the writing for me.The film needed so many re-writes to get it where it needed to be. I get annoyed and disappointed worst of all, when films that try to take you somewhere, can only get you there by making the actions of the characters be the most stupid they could be.I won't go into a massively detailed full story retread, but suffice it to say that the film follows Mia (Sophie Wilde). Mia is an emotionally vulnerable teenager who is still recovering alongside her father Max (Marcus Johnson) over the suicide of Mia's mother Rhea (Alexandria Steffensen) two years prior.Mia ends up going to a party hosted by friends Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and Joss (Chris Alosio) who have an embalmed hand supposedly from a psychic. It can apparently allow any individual to be taken over by a spirit if they say 'talk to me' and then give permission to let the spirit into their bodies.Mia has a best friend called Jade (Alexandra Jensen), who has a younger brother called Riley (Joe Bird). Riley winds up using the hand against Jade's wishes and ushered on by Mia. Riley seemingly gets inhabited by the spirit of Mia's dead mother Rhea. Mia at this point has herself already used the hand several times and been over exposed to its power from the first experience, apparently if you're inhabited by a spirit for more than 90 seconds, you're in trouble.The sheer implication that anyone would be as stupid as to let the spirit inside you is mind boggling. I know they're teenagers but I can't believe it. Mia just witnessed what's quite clearly a spirit on the first attempt after touching the hand and saying 'Talk to me' and she thinks to go again and then let a spirit possess her...get right out of here with that level of crazy!Nothing about this concept looks fun, getting a buzz from letting dead people inside you is just stupid for me I'm sorry. You're literally playing devils advocate with your life and soul, I'm not religious, but in the context of this film and seeing what's in front of you, why would you be so blasé about your life?You can't play the film off as serious and scary and then let us believe anyone would do any of this, if you can't bring the audience in on the realism of the entire plot device to kick start the film, then I'm sorry, you've severely messed up.Everything was so predictable too, there's no element of suspense throughout, the story hits all the numbers you expect of to, or it did for me at least.Where does the 90 second rule come from, no explanation? I'm aware Duckett (Sunny Johnson) who stabs his brother Cole (Ari McCarthy) before killing himself at the start of the film has suffered at the cost of being over exposed to the embalmed hand or that's at least the implication?Is that where the 90 second rule came from and even if Duckett was over exposed to the hand, how would you know it's 90 seconds that did cost him, and not 87 or 88 seconds etc...you then know that when Mia experiments with it, of course she'll be exposed for more than 90 seconds and suffer the ill effects for the rest of the film.The toe sucking scene for instance was stupidly predictable with it being shown as her doing it. This is followed up by more dumb writing where Daniel (Otis Dhanji) awkwardly explains his viewpoint from that night to Jade, when I think that whole scenario could have been avoided with some outright honesty to Jade. Nothing did happen and it would have appeared less weird if they spoke truthfully about what happened straight away, but the writing needed it to create tension between Mia and Jade but I do think it could have been done without too much awkwardness.Why does the little girl later in the film let Mia in, and none of the spirits prior to this seemingly consider doing the same if they're able to? I'd have thought some benefit may be attained from the spirits being able to do this, trapping the living on the other side maybe without needing to wait 90 seconds, I think there was potential there that was wasted or they should have scrapped that idea as it was too messy to integrate.I don't like the convenient information from Cole that the spirits simply still weaken and leave the bodies after a while. There's no suspense with Riley if he'll just get better, how stupid. Also, why did Cole's brother Duckett do what he did, was that a spirit or was he so damaged from the whole incident?I guess you could make a case that Riley is in hospital and monitored and prevented from successfully killing himself. Even still, how many people has Cole seen that have been over exposed and then managed to not kill themselves so he can be aware of this information?His brother killed himself before he could be freed it seems or again so it appeared, there's a real lack of clarity here. Did someone else tell Cole that information perhaps, which in turn means he wouldn't know if that was actually true or not and with his brothers death, why would he believe that! You see my frustration with the writing here.There were several other instances of poor and predictable writing such as Mia being controlled by a spirit that's so evidently not her mother, and the inevitable stabbing of her father Max with the scissors after he barges into her room to help her.Why didn't Mia kill her dad to be safe in the state she was in and how did he not bleed out anyway, or did we just need him alive for the ending so she can run after him in the hospital for the not so shocking ending...Again, Mia will obviously tell Jade to leave the hospital and Jade will discover Max before Jade then informs her mother Sue (Miranda Otto) about Mia but oh it's too late, surprise, surprise. Mia ends up dead in the middle of the road looking like the kangaroo she left to die in the road earlier, and we randomly see the kangaroo's spirit briefly it seems foreshadowing her death.I get this is about her not moving on and taking responsibility for her actions meaning she's destined to be in limbo forever feeling this same grief, fair enough. I still don't think however the kangaroo works as a form of symbolism in this film, it feels wedged in to be more evocative than what it is because it has to have a deeper meaning than the shell of a script was giving it.Sue's instant blaming of Mia just because she did weed once and her not knowing why Riley did what he did, is over the top for me. Sue knows nothing of the hand fair enough too, and I can appreciate she's grief stricken, but she just goes to flat out blaming her daughters friend before she has any further evidence, even in grief, that's not acceptable.I'd like to add that the police appeared content with whatever happened at the house and there's no real reference to them again. Was Mia's bag searched? Surely the hand might possibly have been confiscated and investigated regardless, I find it too unlikely she'd have smuggled something as random as that out successfully but maybe I can just about accept that, one of the few times I can with this script!The second Sue knows it's not drugs, she then apologies to Mia, but what if Mia did play a part in Riley's downfall that wasn't drug related? I mean that's what did happen, Mia consented to Riley using the hand for 50 seconds and then kept him in longer out of selfishness and an inability to get over her mothers death. I'm not expecting Sue to know that but it's a strange approach to take for her to flat out blame Mia, she almost attaches less blame to her own daughter even though I do appreciate the car scene shows her disappointment with Jade, and Sue needing time to heal.This belief that her son was fine and then he's attempting to rip his eyeballs out and smash his head in, again I find Sue's reaction to simply accept it must just be a 'breakdown' as bizarre. You can mask mental health difficulties but this would be something else entirely, does Sue not question what might have caused the breakdown then if it's not drugs?There was a lot of potential here, but Michael and Danny Philippou haven't succeeded in cultivating a believable and moving story.","'ll start positives . film shot really well credit cinematographer Aaron McLisky team efforts.Both practical special effects top quality throughout , never felt anything looked fake . makeup actually effective spirits whole Riley incident .

Talk_to_Me,"I just got out of a pre-screening event for ""Talk to Me,"" and a lady who said she was a rep for the studios and was taking notes to send to the studios and the directors ( Danny Philippou, Michael Philippou ). I was asked my thoughts and I'll share my thoughts as I said them to her: I am happy this isn't pretentious and that the average movie-goer will like it.Needless to say, she wasn't thrilled with my response and went to another person.A24 has built a brand for themselves over the years as being snooty, know-more-than-you and movies that are either too artsy for horror fans or too horror for artsy fans. Personally, I love their brand and welcome all their movies with open arms.""Talk to Me,"" is neither scary nor artsy. It's about as far out there as a ""Nightmare on Elm st."" sequel and hits all the marks: Just enough blood and make up to satisfy the horror hounds and has a likeable story line so everyone can watch this movie and not feel insulted.Mia, played by a phoning-it-in Sophie Wilde, just lost her mother and she spends her time with her best friends family: Jade (Alexandra Jensen); her brother, Riley (Joe Bird) and mom, Sue (Miranda Otto).Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and their friend Joss (Chris Alosio) throw parties where guests shake hands with a supposed real hand of a medium or satanist (both ideas are pitched, but who cares) say ""Talk to Me"" and viola! You got spirits!Do we really care about the rest of the plot? Not really. And, that's the problem: There really isn't much more of a plot. There is a side story about Mia's dead mother using the hand in order to speak with Mia and Riley, becoming severely injured, but, none of it's really entertaining.Are the spirits lying to Mia in order to get a sacrifice to come to our world? Are the spirits using Mia to do their evil bidding? Yes and no, but: you don't care.A24 served up a bland, no brains horror flick with nice blood and was a step outside their realm.

Talk_to_Me,"I'll start with positives. The film was shot really well so credit to cinematographer Aaron McLisky and his team for their efforts.Both practical and special effects were top quality throughout, I never felt anything looked fake. The makeup was actually very effective with the spirits and with the whole Riley incident. Particularly when he injures himself and the scenes subsequently where he is in the hospital are well done. He does look battered and bruised in a gruesome way. Finally, I thought the acting throughout was also good, I can't knock that at all, but there are significant issues, and it's all the writing for me.The film needed so many re-writes to get it where it needed to be. I get annoyed and disappointed worst of all, when films that try to take you somewhere, can only get you there by making the actions of the characters be the most stupid they could be.I won't go into a massively detailed full story retread, but suffice it to say that the film follows Mia (Sophie Wilde). Mia is an emotionally vulnerable teenager who is still recovering alongside her father Max (Marcus Johnson) over the suicide of Mia's mother Rhea (Alexandria Steffensen) two years prior.Mia ends up going to a party hosted by friends Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and Joss (Chris Alosio) who have an embalmed hand supposedly from a psychic. It can apparently allow any individual to be taken over by a spirit if they say 'talk to me' and then give permission to let the spirit into their bodies.Mia has a best friend called Jade (Alexandra Jensen), who has a younger brother called Riley (Joe Bird). Riley winds up using the hand against Jade's wishes and ushered on by Mia. Riley seemingly gets inhabited by the spirit of Mia's dead mother Rhea. Mia at this point has herself already used the hand several times and been over exposed to its power from the first experience, apparently if you're inhabited by a spirit for more than 90 seconds, you're in trouble.The sheer implication that anyone would be as stupid as to let the spirit inside you is mind boggling. I know they're teenagers but I can't believe it. Mia just witnessed what's quite clearly a spirit on the first attempt after touching the hand and saying 'Talk to me' and she thinks to go again and then let a spirit possess her...get right out of here with that level of crazy!Nothing about this concept looks fun, getting a buzz from letting dead people inside you is just stupid for me I'm sorry. You're literally playing devils advocate with your life and soul, I'm not religious, but in the context of this film and seeing what's in front of you, why would you be so blasé about your life?You can't play the film off as serious and scary and then let us believe anyone would do any of this, if you can't bring the audience in on the realism of the entire plot device to kick start the film, then I'm sorry, you've severely messed up.Everything was so predictable too, there's no element of suspense throughout, the story hits all the numbers you expect of to, or it did for me at least.Where does the 90 second rule come from, no explanation? I'm aware Duckett (Sunny Johnson) who stabs his brother Cole (Ari McCarthy) before killing himself at the start of the film has suffered at the cost of being over exposed to the embalmed hand or that's at least the implication?Is that where the 90 second rule came from and even if Duckett was over exposed to the hand, how would you know it's 90 seconds that did cost him, and not 87 or 88 seconds etc...you then know that when Mia experiments with it, of course she'll be exposed for more than 90 seconds and suffer the ill effects for the rest of the film.The toe sucking scene for instance was stupidly predictable with it being shown as her doing it. This is followed up by more dumb writing where Daniel (Otis Dhanji) awkwardly explains his viewpoint from that night to Jade, when I think that whole scenario could have been avoided with some outright honesty to Jade. Nothing did happen and it would have appeared less weird if they spoke truthfully about what happened straight away, but the writing needed it to create tension between Mia and Jade but I do think it could have been done without too much awkwardness.Why does the little girl later in the film let Mia in, and none of the spirits prior to this seemingly consider doing the same if they're able to? I'd have thought some benefit may be attained from the spirits being able to do this, trapping the living on the other side maybe without needing to wait 90 seconds, I think there was potential there that was wasted or they should have scrapped that idea as it was too messy to integrate.I don't like the convenient information from Cole that the spirits simply still weaken and leave the bodies after a while. There's no suspense with Riley if he'll just get better, how stupid. Also, why did Cole's brother Duckett do what he did, was that a spirit or was he so damaged from the whole incident?I guess you could make a case that Riley is in hospital and monitored and prevented from successfully killing himself. Even still, how many people has Cole seen that have been over exposed and then managed to not kill themselves so he can be aware of this information?His brother killed himself before he could be freed it seems or again so it appeared, there's a real lack of clarity here. Did someone else tell Cole that information perhaps, which in turn means he wouldn't know if that was actually true or not and with his brothers death, why would he believe that! You see my frustration with the writing here.There were several other instances of poor and predictable writing such as Mia being controlled by a spirit that's so evidently not her mother, and the inevitable stabbing of her father Max with the scissors after he barges into her room to help her.Why didn't Mia kill her dad to be safe in the state she was in and how did he not bleed out anyway, or did we just need him alive for the ending so she can run after him in the hospital for the not so shocking ending...Again, Mia will obviously tell Jade to leave the hospital and Jade will discover Max before Jade then informs her mother Sue (Miranda Otto) about Mia but oh it's too late, surprise, surprise. Mia ends up dead in the middle of the road looking like the kangaroo she left to die in the road earlier, and we randomly see the kangaroo's spirit briefly it seems foreshadowing her death.I get this is about her not moving on and taking responsibility for her actions meaning she's destined to be in limbo forever feeling this same grief, fair enough. I still don't think however the kangaroo works as a form of symbolism in this film, it feels wedged in to be more evocative than what it is because it has to have a deeper meaning than the shell of a script was giving it.Sue's instant blaming of Mia just because she did weed once and her not knowing why Riley did what he did, is over the top for me. Sue knows nothing of the hand fair enough too, and I can appreciate she's grief stricken, but she just goes to flat out blaming her daughters friend before she has any further evidence, even in grief, that's not acceptable.I'd like to add that the police appeared content with whatever happened at the house and there's no real reference to them again. Was Mia's bag searched? Surely the hand might possibly have been confiscated and investigated regardless, I find it too unlikely she'd have smuggled something as random as that out successfully but maybe I can just about accept that, one of the few times I can with this script!The second Sue knows it's not drugs, she then apologies to Mia, but what if Mia did play a part in Riley's downfall that wasn't drug related? I mean that's what did happen, Mia consented to Riley using the hand for 50 seconds and then kept him in longer out of selfishness and an inability to get over her mothers death. I'm not expecting Sue to know that but it's a strange approach to take for her to flat out blame Mia, she almost attaches less blame to her own daughter even though I do appreciate the car scene shows her disappointment with Jade, and Sue needing time to heal.This belief that her son was fine and then he's attempting to rip his eyeballs out and smash his head in, again I find Sue's reaction to simply accept it must just be a 'breakdown' as bizarre. You can mask mental health difficulties but this would be something else entirely, does Sue not question what might have caused the breakdown then if it's not drugs?There was a lot of potential here, but Michael and Danny Philippou haven't succeeded in cultivating a believable and moving story.","'ll start positives . film shot really well credit cinematographer Aaron McLisky team efforts.Both practical special effects top quality throughout , never felt anything looked fake . makeup actually effective spirits whole Riley incident .

Talk_to_Me,"Talk to Me (not a very scary name) is about some teenagers who promote themselves on social media by having strange seances where they use a hand that can summon the dead. But one night, one of them holds onto the hand a little too long and the demons start to chase the teenagers and cause chaos in their lives.This should have been a more rewarding premise, but about midway through the film the story begins to have too many plots that it fails to develop and loses track of what made it such an interesting premise in the first place. Also, there are some really dumb things that happen in this movie. It's not a film where the main characters try to solve a problem more than it's just the character go around in circles.","Talk ( scary name ) teenagers promote social media strange seances use hand summon dead . one night , one holds onto hand little long demons start chase teenagers cause chaos lives.This rewarding premise , midway film story begins many plots fails develop loses track made interesting premise first place .

Talk_to_Me,"I just got out of a pre-screening event for ""Talk to Me,"" and a lady who said she was a rep for the studios and was taking notes to send to the studios and the directors ( Danny Philippou, Michael Philippou ). I was asked my thoughts and I'll share my thoughts as I said them to her: I am happy this isn't pretentious and that the average movie-goer will like it.Needless to say, she wasn't thrilled with my response and went to another person.A24 has built a brand for themselves over the years as being snooty, know-more-than-you and movies that are either too artsy for horror fans or too horror for artsy fans. Personally, I love their brand and welcome all their movies with open arms.""Talk to Me,"" is neither scary nor artsy. It's about as far out there as a ""Nightmare on Elm st."" sequel and hits all the marks: Just enough blood and make up to satisfy the horror hounds and has a likeable story line so everyone can watch this movie and not feel insulted.Mia, played by a phoning-it-in Sophie Wilde, just lost her mother and she spends her time with her best friends family: Jade (Alexandra Jensen); her brother, Riley (Joe Bird) and mom, Sue (Miranda Otto).Hayley (Zoe Terakes) and their friend Joss (Chris Alosio) throw parties where guests shake hands with a supposed real hand of a medium or satanist (both ideas are pitched, but who cares) say ""Talk to Me"" and viola! You got spirits!Do we really care about the rest of the plot? Not really. And, that's the problem: There really isn't much more of a plot. There is a side story about Mia's dead mother using the hand in order to speak with Mia and Riley, becoming severely injured, but, none of it's really entertaining.Are the spirits lying to Mia in order to get a sacrifice to come to our world? Are the spirits using Mia to do their evil bidding? Yes and no, but: you don't care.A24 served up a bland, no brains horror flick with nice blood and was a step outside their realm. There's no cool shots, there's not a lot to think about but there is a lot of music and score, which was different.Go into ""Talk to Me"" expecting nothing and you'll walk out happy.","got pre-screening event `` Talk , '' lady said rep studios taking notes send studios directors ( Danny Philippou , Michael Philippou ) . asked thoughts 'll share thoughts said : happy n't pretentious average movie-goer like it.Needless say , n't thrilled response went another person.A24 built brand years snooty , know-more-than-you movies either artsy horror fans horror artsy fans .

Talk_to_Me,"Intelligent horror. For once there's a horror movie with character development and a scenario they're out in that gets the audience invested in. Not since the first Elm Street movie was there ever an intelligent story about fear and loss. The movie examines the curiosity of what's on the other side of this life. Yes, it's also creepy, haunting, and with enough jump scares for the feeble folks.The movie opens dark and ends in a way that may stay with you for a while. I found it to be an intelligent movie that examines life and death. The monster is the fear itself of what lies in the other side.

It seemed that more noise was used to make it look scary than scary elements. You notice that the actors forget their mistakes in a very childish way and repeat them again. The script was very lame.

Talk_to_Me,"Australian horror ""Talk to me"" could have been the same old thing with possession and spooky ghosts only the main characters can see. But its proper gruesome enough to keep old school fans happy, and manages to feel modern without being cringey and avoiding lame jump scares.There's a spooky hand doing the rounds at teenage parties. One that people hold to see ghosts before allowing the spooks to briefly possess them. Off course this is all going to go wrong. But it can be a brutal shocker so you'll not be disappointed in the direction it does go. Much like the latest ""evil dead"" its truly horrific, but also has the occasional awkward laugh. But this one also knows not to stick around for too long.

Talk_to_Me,"Danny and Michael Philippou have truly made something special here and hope it gets the attention it deserves. Known by their YouTube channel ""RackaRacka"" They were able to pull off a great low budget horror film on the budget of $4.5 million Australian dollars that feels at least 20 million.The cinematography and direction were all incredible with some expertly crafted scenes and a very dark and foreboding story that does have some originality to it despite being another supernatural, hell-demon, ""other side"" story. The scenes with the hand were legitimately scary and tense with a very unpredictable nature to it, the rest of the story was surprisingly unpredictable and unconventional, that also captures the modern Australian generation very well.The acting in this movie was off the charts and really delivered every emotion these characters were feeling at any given time and their reaction to exactly what was happening, internally and externally. The movie does depict Australian Gen Zérs pretty well, me being one of them. They did use it to their advantage in this movie, with RackaRacka being Gen Z as well, they were able to nail their modern Australian characters to perfection.The movie really did have an impactful effect on me, with me starting to feel a little ill by the end of the movie and me processing what all had just happened that I won't spoil in this review. Overall, the tone didn't just feel like shallow horror, but a legitimate one that actually has a foothold in Australian society that did feel somewhat believable in certain areas. The tension was soaring and ever present, the music was great too, there weren't many jump scares in this but the scary scenes themselves were clever and hard hitting.The movie didn't just fly by either, it did feel like it did run a bit longer than just 90 minutes and I did appreciate how it held my attention the way it did. I did feel genuine dread from it, that I haven't felt from a horror movie like this in a VERY long time. If not ever. The only problem I had with it is that I wished the story was a bit more revelatory and not so secretive in a lot of areas.Go see it if you're a fan of Horror and Modern Australian Cinema. I hope this brings nothing but success for The Philippou Brothers and the film has already gotten recognition by several popular horror directors including Jordan Peele.","Danny Michael Philippou truly made something special hope gets attention deserves .

Talk_to_Me,"The premise was what initially drew me to this film, although it's not that different from similar movies in the genre. Replacing the Ouija board with a ceramic hand was a creative and unique touch that the horror genre needs more of, and for that alone this movie deserves some recognition. Creativity and ingenuity are the two elements that the horror genre is sorely lacking, and it's great to see how the new generation is utilizing premises that have been done countless times before and giving them an unexpected spin. That being said, that's about the only thing about this movie that is worth praising.If you've ever seen a movie about demonic possession, spirit conjuring, or communicating with the dead via an Ouija board, you've already seen this film. Aside from the method being used, this has been done plenty of times before, and at times I found myself wondering if the people who made this have ever seen a movie in the genre before, because almost every idea was ripped form some other movie. There were so many ways you could have made this movie truly ingenious, but they kept it safe and did the basic ""let's gather a bunch of teens together to communicate with the dead"" that has already been done TO DEATH so many times. I wish they would have pushed the envelope, going for stuff that was more shocking instead of treading familiar ground. It's what made me ultimately not care much about what transpired in the film.The nail on the coffin was the cast, though. Filling a movie with insufferable and unlikable teenagers and young adults completely removed me from the experience. Similar to ""Bodies Bodies Bodies', the cast was a bunch of try-hard teenagers with nasty attitudes, poor behavior and partaking in degenerate behavior that always sits very poorly with me. I'm so glad I neither had friends like any of these people, and that I never had the misfortune of interacting with anyone who behaved this badly in my youth. I believe the movie would have been more effective with an adult cast, but that's just my personal taste.Overall, a novel concept with mediocre execution makes for a somewhat entertaining film that I didn't regret watching but that I really can't be bothered to recommend. Aside from one scene that was really effective in instilling fear and dread, the rest of the movie is a retread of every Ouija board film you've ever seen. Where a movie like SMILE brings something new and original to the genre, Talk To Me just brings the same old concepts in the palm of a new hand.","premise initially drew film , although 's different similar movies genre .

Talk_to_Me,"I've spoken in the past about being a big fan of Australian horror movies. Some of my all time favourites have come from this country. So it's a little disappointing that the last two Australian horror movies I've watched ('Run Rabbit Run' and 'Talk to Me') have been a bit of a let down. The latter was nowhere near as big of a let down as the former to be fair. There were parts of this film I liked, but overall it didn't quite hit the right spots.I'm finding possession films less and less scary with every year that goes by. I find that as soon as you see the ghosts/demons it's just too hard to believe (even though the make-up work in 'Talk to Me' was very well done). The only time it really works for me any more is in films like 'Paranormal Activity' where you rarely actually see anything. Seeing less will always be more in this circumstance.So I didn't find the film overly scary, and then all I really have to fall back on is the characters. Sadly we've reached a point where the only way to write realistic teenage characters any more is to make them extremely unpleasant. If they were all overly nice it wouldn't feel like they were properly written, yet if they are particularly unpleasant then it isn't much fun to watch them. It's a real predicament that the horror genre has and I don't know the way around it.I will say that the ghosts/demons were done in such a way that if that is the kind of thing that scares you I could see this movie being very effective and creepy. Otherwise though, you might be fresh out of luck with this one. 6/10.","'ve spoken past big fan Australian horror movies . time favourites come country .

Talk_to_Me,"Another week, another jumpscare demon summoning movie. This time from Australia, but aside from the accents it looks and feels entirely American. The usual ingredients are all there. A cast of annoying, loudmoth, diverse, phone addicted teenagers come across cursed artifact that allows them to contact the spirit realm and become briefly possessed. In this film it's an embalmed hand.Naturally the main characters have a traumatic backstory, with their mother having passed in an untimely manner. They end up talking to her, but stay connected to the other side for too long. Bad things happen.If you've suffered through bad music, bad acting and bad party scenes until that point in the film, you can be relieved. Things do get better, which is a rarity for the horror genre. Usually they start strong and run out of steam. This one is the opposite. It significantly improves as it goes along.There are some good ideas here, but sadly they're never fully developed or fully explained. The ending is by far the strongest part of the film, but the buildup to it remains virtually unexplained. It's a pity, because there would have been room for a good moral dilemma. Still, the last scene is great and redeems the second half of the film.On a technical level, the film is competently made. The color grading looks really nice, which is almost a rarity in films these days. The scary scenes are very well filmed and the audio editing is top notch. Audio is the most important aspect of a horror film, and they nail it here. The rotating camera gimmick is fun, but gets overused.If you can get through the horrible first half, you might get some enjoyment out of this. Overall, I couldn't enjoy it.

Talk_to_Me,"A24 has a way of putting out these supposedly great arthouse horror films, but they almost all feel like the story is an afterthought once the filmmakers have come up with their premise. This film is a perfect example of that.Midway through the film, the characters actions and their motivations seem more and more unbelievable until the end when you can't help but think that the main character is either the most naive individual to walk the planet or just willfully ignorant to what is happening to her. The story gets pretty convoluted and the rules of how the hand is supposed to work is never clearly outlined, nor do we find out anything about the hand or it's origin or how these random kids in Australia have it or how the kids all way across the world at the end have it. One of the rare films where I would've like some elaboration on what was going on.Also, this film forgets the most important part of being a horror film. It's just not scary. Jumpscares only take you so far. Everybody talking about this film being brutal and shocking must be lying as well. If seeing someone hit their head on a table or a wall is gruesome to you just because blood is present, I'd have to say you're very weak stomached.Overall, a disappointing film.

Talk_to_Me,"Many American movies have tried very hard to show teens and children are being dumb, mean and dangerous, but none hold a candle to this Aussie flick.The main character is the most disgusting creature I've seen in a while: one of those people who consider themselves good and even righteous, cool and positive, while destroying everything around them. People like these are one of the most terrifying things in the world and that is why Talk to Me was extremely disturbing. And it's not just Mia. Almost all of the teen characters in the film show a level of selfishness and lack of awareness that is more scary than any ghost.Speaking of the ghosts... it's not very clear what they wanted. You get the standard dead corpse evil demon possession, but like so many other movies, they don't explain why they would be like that or what drives them. As mere McGuffins, therefore, they are uninteresting.Bottom line: after watching this film, talking to dead people was the thing least on my mind.

Talk_to_Me,"When we think of Australia, we think of kangaroos, koalas, the Outback, the Sydney Opera House, and English rednecks (as Robin Williams defined the Aussies). But most people probably don't know that there's an entire genre of Australian cinema depicting disturbing things. About ten or so years ago I saw an Aussie neo-noir thriller called ""The Square"", about a tryst that spins out of control. More recently, the land down under gave us ""The Babadook"", about a horrific being that escapes from a child's book.Well, now we have an Aussie movie about demonic possession. This one features some teens who discover that an embalmed hand can enable them to communicate with spirits. Sure enough, the game goes too far, and the terror isn't going away for one girl.

Quite the opposite of the pristine image that we have of Australia.This is the sort of movie that the fainthearted should avoid at all costs.

Talk_to_Me,"I have 3 very big problems with this movie.First of all this is a well tried trope and very common story. We have seen this in movies before, seen it in TV shows, and read it in books. This is immensely cliche. And as such you need to do something special with it, and you need to find some angle or extra to make it stand out, but no. This is just a cliche as you might think. No thought process whatsoever.Secondly this is amateurish. Everything is. This looks like, feels like and is acted like a middle-school project made by failing drama students. I could get behind some of that, horror does not need to have a huge cgi budget, but it cannot be amateurish on all levels, on all things.Thirdly, is this actually a horror movie? The premiss is boring and cliche, and there is nothing really scary or weird or thought-provoking about this. And the ending? Omg... so predictable that if you did not see that coming, I am sorry, but if so you need a doctor.I cannot find any redeeming traits or positives about this. I will still give it a 2/10 because however strange it may sound this is not the worst movie of the year. I do not think this movie will even make it into top 10 worse of the year... isn't that sad?","3 big problems movie.First well tried trope common story . seen movies , seen TV shows , read books . immensely cliche . need something special , need find angle extra make stand , . cliche might think . thought process whatsoever.Secondly amateurish .

Talk_to_Me,"Talk To Me, the debut movie from Aussie directors Danny and Michael Philippou (the men behind popular YouTube channel RackaRacka), feels more Blumhouse than it does A24, and as far as I am concerned that's a good thing. It's far less pretentious and arthouse than I had expected, and a lot less boring.Sophie Wilde plays Mia, who attends a party where her friends dabble with the occult, using a porcelain hand that has the power to connect the living with the dead: all a person has to do is hold the hand and say 'Talk to me'. The important thing to remember is not to hold on for longer than 90 seconds. Of course, Mia does just that, leaving the door wide open for unwelcome spirits to come a-visiting.A likeable cast, plenty of creepiness, a smidge of uncomfortable brutality (the standout scenes involving some nasty self harm), and a neat ending ensure that Talk To Me is a thoroughly entertaining ride from start to finish. Sure, some characters make questionable choices in the film, but that is par for the course for a teen horror, and it doesn't detract too much from the fun. Was I scared?

Talk_to_Me,"The opening scene was the strongest part of the movie, it is shocking and instantly grabs your attention. However, that energy doesn't carry over to the rest of the film.This is an example of an idea outweighing its execution. The concept of the embalmed hand used to conjure spirits was unique but aside from that this film doesn't do anything special. The main character grieves the loss of her mother and wishes to connect with her so she uses the hand to do so. This film reminded me a bit of ""Insidious Chapter 3"" but it wasn't as good. There is only one other scene besides the opening scene that has any kind of tension or suspense. This film lacked atmospheric horror as well as jump scares. There wasn't even anything creepy about the spirits that were conjured.The origin of the embalmed hand wasn't concrete as some characters had different stories as to where the hand came from. It would have been nice if they just picked an idea and stuck with it.The development of every single character in this movie was bare bones. The main character was grieving her mother and didn't have a good relationship with her father. Her father was made to seem like he had an important role in the film but he didn't. She had a best friend who had a little brother and a boyfriend. The dynamics between all of those characters are very cliché and corny.This film was a waste of time and a complete let down.

May_December,"So, I just finished ""May December"" on Netflix, and honestly, it's one of those films that really makes you sit up and pay attention. The way the director, Todd Haynes, captures the everyday life with a sort of haunting twist is something else. You've got Natalie Portman, who absolutely nails her role as Elizabeth, this actress trying to delve into Julianne Moore's character, Gracie. The story itself is heavy, dealing with past relationships and moral complexities that don't give easy answers.What's really striking is how the film plays with perceptions. One minute, you think you've got Elizabeth figured out, and then the next, you're questioning everything. Julianne Moore as Gracie is phenomenal - she brings a depth to her character that's both unsettling and captivating. The way the film portrays their lives in Savannah, with its dream-like quality, adds another layer to the whole experience.And let's talk about the background score and cinematography. They're not just there for show; they add to the mood, almost becoming characters themselves. The historical tours in the background, for instance, add this eerie sense of history and tragedy lingering just out of sight.This isn't just a movie; it's an experience that challenges you to think and re-think. It's the kind of film that stays with you, makes you question things. Definitely worth the watch, especially if you're into films that aren't just black and white but explore the grey areas of life and relationships.

Why would Elizabeth shudder quite obviously along with a score fitting the end of The Sixth Sense, as if we just found out a stunning plot twist? Why is it so shocking that Georgie, whose nuts, would tell his mother, also nuts, what he told the dumb and equally nuts, actress? This movie was slow, boring, the sex was thrown in to stun. What the heck was Elizabeth doing in the stockroom? Joe and Gracie are without a doubt, Mary Kay and her 13-year-old, Vili. They re-shot all the magazine and tabloid photos that we saw at the time, with these actors, so the writer saying they only borrowed from that scandal a bit is a little ridiculous.

May_December,"On this website, the film ""May December"" is listed as a comedy-drama. If there is a comic element to the film, it has to be of the darkest nature imaginable. To put it another way: This tawdry film is not like the Neil Simon comedy ""The Odd Couple""!!!It is graduation day for the family of the Atherton-Yoos, as two of the children are preparing for commencement and heading off to college! But this is not your regular nuclear family ... not by a long shot!The conceit of the film is that Miss Elizabeth Berry is an actress who will be playing the role of Gracie Atherton-Yoo in an upcoming made-for-television movie. The audience follows along with Elizabeth in getting to know the Atherton-Yoos! But in one of the most bizarre scenes in the film, Elizabeth seduces Joe, the husband of Gracie. When the poor schlub says that he feels they have a ""connection,"" Elizabeth brushes him off with the remark that this is what grown-ups do!In another outrageous moment, Gracie refuses to have a ""serious"" conversation with her husband about their ""relationship."" Again, Joe gets the brush off when he is told at age 13, HE had seduced the much older adult Gracie, and HE was ""the boss."" It is no wonder that after smoking a joint with his son, Joe begins blubbering like a baby and is comforted by the high school graduate!It is difficult to conceive what the filmmakers were thinking in adapting to the screen the true story of Mary Kay Letourneau. The actress Elizabeth Berry was ostensibly aiming for an accurate characterization of the real Gracie Atherton-Yoo. And yet the filmmakers completely missied the mark on the true story of Letourneau, who seduced her seventh-grade student, as opposed to hooking up in a pet store. And their coupling occurred in a car, not in a storage room. The offspring were born in prison, and the family did not live in luxury home in Savannah!The film merits 3 stars only for the fine performances of Natalie Portman as Elizabeth and Julianne Moore as Gracie in a film that is utterly depressing and unpleasant.","website , film `` May December '' listed comedy-drama . comic element film , darkest nature imaginable . put another way : tawdry film like Neil Simon comedy `` Odd Couple '' ! ! ! graduation day family Atherton-Yoos , two children preparing commencement heading college ! regular nuclear family ... long shot ! conceit film Miss Elizabeth Berry actress playing role Gracie Atherton-Yoo upcoming made-for-television movie . audience follows along Elizabeth getting know Atherton-Yoos ! one bizarre scenes film , Elizabeth seduces Joe , husband Gracie . poor schlub says feels `` connection , '' Elizabeth brushes remark grown-ups ! another outrageous moment , Gracie refuses `` serious '' conversation husband `` relationship .

It follows a woman played by Julianne Moore who raped a 13 year old and manipulated him to stay and raise a family. While Natalie Portman plays an actress collecting information before they shoot a tv film on the whole situation where she plays the predatory woman. It's about 2 hours of awkward conversation and piss poor dialogue which is a shame for actors of their calibre. The actress (Natalie Portman) sleeps with this man who is like a 13 year old boy trapped in a 36 year olds body. Similar to Nina in Black Swan except awfully done. There was even a part in the movie where Natalie's character is looking at the prospects for the role of the 13 year old boy and she says ""The kids are cute, but not sexy enough.

May_December,"The concept behind this movie is interesting. In the form of an actress aiming to portray the wife that actually married a twelve year old when she was 30, the opportunity is opened for a probe into exactly what happened and why. Instead of using this device to actually penetrate reality, the actress instead spends her time talking to everyone she meets about absolutely nothing more than idle conversation. Then she decides to become a participant instead of an observer and derails any attempt at depth. The whole thing is basically a rehash of the superficial combined with an extraneous side issue. It's all too bad.

Melton really nailed the portrayal of someone stuck in life, unable to process the trauma he lived through. The only adult in his life he could turn to as an adolescent, young adult was his groomer, a delusional woman who projected ridiculous, unbelievable things onto a child and took no responsibility for entrapping him.The scene when Elizabeth/Joe briefly hookup just displays the ludicrous nature of an adult claiming they were overpowered by the seduction/prowess of a 13 virgin boy or girl.

May_December,"The film ""May December"" presents itself as a challenging and, unfortunately, frustrating experience for the viewer. The screenplay falls short from the early minutes, with a narrative that seems to lack consistency and engagement.The difficulty in understanding the dialogues due to Spanish subtitles adds a level of discomfort to the experience, making some scenes even more obscure. This is particularly relevant in a film with pivotal moments left in doubt, such as the conversation between Gracie and Joe Yoo at 1:03:15, where the intensity of the scene is notably delivered by Julianne Moore.Moore's remarkable performance, in contrast with Charles Melton's unsatisfactory portrayal of Joe Yoo, negatively impacts the overall quality of the production. The plot appears to unfold into a series of disjointed and, in some cases, unnecessary events, like the forest scene at 1:43:32, where Gracie, armed, confronts a fox, leaving the viewer puzzled about its necessity and importance.Tense moments, such as the conversation in the room between Joe and Gracie at 1:32:10, promise emotional complexity, but the difficulty in fully grasping the context limits the appreciation of these crucial scenes.The final scene, set in a studio as Elizabeth records the film about Gracie, concludes with a disappointing outcome. This narrative choice may leave viewers dissatisfied, especially when compared to the initial promise of the film.Amidst these challenges, the exceptional performances of Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore stand out as undeniable positive aspects. Both actresses deliver magnificent interpretations, providing a more palatable experience despite the film's shortcomings.In summary, ""May December"" is a film that has garnered both positive and negative reviews, where the stellar performances of the leading ladies contrast with a problematic screenplay and questionable directorial choices. The confusion in understanding certain scenes, a personal issue of mine as I am not proficient in English and couldn't comprehend all the Spanish subtitles, coupled with a disappointing conclusion, left me disheartened with this Todd Haynes drama.","film `` May December '' presents challenging , unfortunately , frustrating experience viewer . screenplay falls short early minutes , narrative seems lack consistency engagement.The difficulty understanding dialogues due Spanish subtitles adds level discomfort experience , making scenes even obscure . particularly relevant film pivotal moments left doubt , conversation Gracie Joe Yoo 1:03:15 , intensity scene notably delivered Julianne Moore.Moore 's remarkable performance , contrast Charles Melton 's unsatisfactory portrayal Joe Yoo , negatively impacts overall quality production . plot appears unfold series disjointed , cases , unnecessary events , like forest scene 1:43:32 , Gracie , armed , confronts fox , leaving viewer puzzled necessity importance.Tense moments , conversation room Joe Gracie 1:32:10 , promise emotional complexity , difficulty fully grasping context limits appreciation crucial scenes.The final scene , set studio Elizabeth records film Gracie , concludes disappointing outcome . narrative choice may leave viewers dissatisfied , especially compared initial promise film.Amidst challenges , exceptional performances Natalie Portman Julianne Moore stand undeniable positive aspects . actresses deliver magnificent interpretations , providing palatable experience despite film 's shortcomings.In summary , `` May December '' film garnered positive negative reviews , stellar performances leading ladies contrast problematic screenplay questionable directorial choices . confusion understanding certain scenes , personal issue mine proficient English could n't comprehend Spanish subtitles , coupled disappointing conclusion , left disheartened Todd Haynes drama .","film `` may decemb '' present challeng , unfortun , frustrat experi viewer . screenplay fall short earli minut , narr seem lack consist engagement.th difficulti understand dialogu due spanish subtitl add level discomfort experi , make scene even obscur . particularli relev film pivot moment left doubt , convers graci joe yoo 1:03:15 , intens scene notabl deliv juliann moore.moor 's remark perform , contrast charl melton 's unsatisfactori portray joe yoo , neg impact overal qualiti product . plot appear unfold seri disjoint , case , unnecessari event , like forest scene 1:43:32 , graci , arm , confront fox , leav viewer puzzl necess importance.tens moment , convers room joe graci 1:32:10 , promis emot complex , difficulti fulli grasp context limit appreci crucial scenes.th final scene , set studio elizabeth record film graci , conclud disappoint outcom . narr choic may leav viewer dissatisfi , especi compar initi promis film.amidst challeng , except perform natali portman juliann moor stand undeni posit aspect . actress deliv magnific interpret , provid palat experi despit film 's shortcomings.in summari , `` may decemb '' film garner posit neg review , stellar perform lead ladi contrast problemat screenplay question directori choic . confus understand certain scene , person issu mine profici english could n't comprehend spanish subtitl , coupl disappoint conclus , left dishearten todd hayn drama .",bad,negative,-0.8782
May_December,"This movie had no depth whatsoever. We get no real glimpses into the motivations or back stories of the characters. It's hard to really care about any of them and it feels gross watching a somewhat sympathetic look at a woman who has assaulted and manipulated someone since they were in 7th grade. Melton's character barely has a voice until the end and even then it feels like a stretch to have gotten to that point. Portman's character essentially exploit Meltons character at the end and it seems to draw parallels with the exploitation Julianne Moore's character Gracie did and continues to do to Joe. The way the relationship was portrayed was icky as well as the overall tone of the movie. The reveal that Gracie's character was abused by her brothers (although even the implication feels so bland and almost painted over by the quickness of the moment) doesn't excuse her behavior. Trauma is valid but not an excuse for people to do horrible things to others, but this plot point is thrown like a stale biscuit to viewers. And then it turns out it wasn't true?

May_December,"I loved this movie. People are too distracted these days and expect constant over-stimulation and are upset because the movie moves slow. I think it runs a pace that is real. No flashback scenes which I appreciated because you follow the story with Natalie Portman as she studies Julianne Moore, but discovers a lot more than she expected.You see Natalie slowly turn in to the character and lose grip on reality. Just as she had once said about Julianne while talking with the lawyer in regards to her being delusional and not in touch with reality. In trying to become Julianne, Natalie actually does become her as you can see in the end.A couple parts with music were a little distracting from the heavyweight of emotional exchanges. The actors did an incredible and believable job. You see the toll that Julianne's actions take place on her mental health, and everyone else she hurt around her. It was so disturbing to see personalities switch and flow with ease, a real psychotic skill. I'm also so glad to see Charles Melton step away from Riverside because he does have a true talent for dramatic roles. You can see him clearly being an adult, still trapped as that 13 year old boy she took advantage of. The constant struggle he has within himself about everything, especially towards the end when he realizes he's about to be isolated just as much as Julianne has made herself to be.In a tragic and unimaginable trauma, this story really shows the multitude of victims and of consequences tied to one person's decision.","loved movie .

May_December,"Allow me to say this, if you know anything about the Mary Kay Letourneau case where she groomed, seduced, and had sex with an underage boy by the name of Vili Fualaau (he was 12), then you'll understand the storyline in ""May December."" Only the names and locations have been changed. The screenwriter Samy Burch said at a New York Film Festival screening that she drew inspiration for the film from seeing the connection between the media climate during Letourneau's case and the current true-crime boom.My primary question is: why choose to base a film on the actions of Mary Kay Letourneau, a notorious sexual predator? Given the numerous documentaries and films already exploring this disturbing story, it raises concerns about the decision to create yet another work with similar subject matter.Despite very good performances by Moore and Portman, the film suffered from a slow and unnecessarily lengthy runtime of 113 minutes, which could have been condensed to 90 minutes. Certain scenes seemed mundane and failed to contribute meaningfully to the story and as they say...should have been left on the cutting room floor.Charles Melton, portraying the pivotal role of the young man who becomes the adult husband of Moore's character, fell short in delivering a convincing performance. His portrayal lacked depth and failed to capture the nuanced emotions of a person grappling with suppressed trauma from a childhood incident of sexual abuse by his older, manipulative wife. The character's complexity demanded a more adept actor, and Melton's portrayal ultimately felt inadequate.Additionally, a subplot involving Portman's character seducing Melton's character for information felt unnecessary and problematic. It added another layer of exploitation, with a more experienced woman taking advantage of the vulnerable young man. This further detracted from the film's credibility and overall impact.Overall, ""May December"" is 4 star for me only because of Moore and Portman.","Allow say , know anything Mary Kay Letourneau case groomed , seduced , sex underage boy name Vili Fualaau ( 12 ) , 'll understand storyline `` May December .

The_Killer,"Defnitely not a bad movie for sure, but one which has an odd feature that might annoy or put off some folks...The bad: beware this movie is one contineous MONOLOGUE by Michael Fassbender, contineously speaking to himself in his head (silently) about HOW he is planning AND executing his killing sprees. We as viewers get to LISTEN CONSTANTLY to the thoughts of this meticulous and ruthless professional killer, who is on a revenge killing spree after his wife got molested by his very crime boss whom he worked for.The monologue is THE movie. Not kiddin'. There is little to NO diaologue or interaction between any other characters. It's solely focussed on Michael Fassbender's thoughts as a character and those thoughts unfortunately werent the most interesting.

Bummer. There isnt a satisfying final to this story. On the contrary the final is a bit underwhelming. There definitely is a lack of true drama and thrill towards the end.The good: It has got several beautiful features though, like this bleak and dark lit photography, a sparse yet very effective hypnotizing soundscore and several great actors performing well (yet not extraordinary well). And the suspense and violence is almost hypnotic like, really mesmirizing.Despite this definitely being another quality made crime movie, it is not one of director David Fincher's best.

The_Killer,"You've all seen this story before, but never this intensely boring, never this predictable, never this smooth, without twists, surprises and suspense. The movie starts with the voice-over of the hitman: ""If you are unable to endure boredom, this work is not for you."" He is talking about his profession, but it can be seen as a fair warning - or a great, cynical joke that most people will only get, when it's already too late.This is a very dry version of the cartoonish ""John Wick""-movies. But while Wick only kills his colleagues, Michael Fassbender's Killer will also murder the innocent. He is not a likeable character, just an emotionless, highly efficient tool. The only hint of his personality is that he always listens to the 80ies band ""The Smiths"", self-pityingly lamenting ""I am human and I need to be loved"" or revelling in violent phantasies, ""If a double-decker bus crashes into us"". It is probably supposed to humanize him, but it is just annoying.While ""The Killer"" bears some resemblances to French crime movies of the 60ies, it is actually based on a series of French comic books that started in 1998. The only surprise bigger than that is that this drab, forgettable, useless film is made by David Fincher. As the story sounds - and is - incredibly stale, it's his name that will draw in the audience. ""The Killer"" is bound to destroy quite a bit of his reputation.","'ve seen story , never intensely boring , never predictable , never smooth , without twists , surprises suspense . movie starts voice-over hitman : `` unable endure boredom , work .

The_Killer,"I don't know why this movie script made in a weird old narrative way. From the very beginning, the hitman character started a non-stop narration, some kind of thoughts flowed in his brain and mind, but more like he's writing a memoir, talked into a recorder, describing what happened after he fouled play an assassin, and even he was so careful to hide his personal life, no matter how he zigzagged to escape from the failed contract, his employer already started to wipe him out. The narration continued blabbering through the whole situation that he had encountered and had to deal with. But what we saw in this movie was actually a mess. The hitman and hit woman who tried to kill him were a duo, one black thug, one white woman, both didn't look a bit like hitmen or assassins. The whole story went along with his memoir style narration, like watching Korean movies, cuz the characters in Korean movies often talked to himself or herself, they talked like it's the thoughts in their brains, but more like old people often talked to themselves. This stupid arrangement completely ruined the suspense, so tiresome and so unbearable.Fighting scenes usually went on in darkness. Dialogue, besides the blah, blah narration, felt so awkward and contrite. All the supporting actors who played all the roles were cast wrong, all of them were more like amateurish ordinary people. Those who hired him to do the killings were even more unbelievable, not even looked like criminals, albeit connected to some crime syndicates or organizations. The whole movie just felt like it's written by someone who didn't know anything about hitman, assassination, contract killing business. A highly anticipated thriller turned out to be a laughable mess.","n't know movie script made weird old narrative way . beginning , hitman character started non-stop narration , kind thoughts flowed brain mind , like 's writing memoir , talked recorder , describing happened fouled play assassin , even careful hide personal life , matter zigzagged escape failed contract , employer already started wipe . narration continued blabbering whole situation encountered deal . saw movie actually mess . hitman hit woman tried kill duo , one black thug , one white woman , n't look bit like hitmen assassins . whole story went along memoir style narration , like watching Korean movies , cuz characters Korean movies often talked , talked like 's thoughts brains , like old people often talked . stupid arrangement completely ruined suspense , tiresome unbearable.Fighting scenes usually went darkness .

The_Killer,"The brilliant acting of Michael Fassbender and the work of director David Fincher create an atmosphere of constant tension, also with camera angles, lighting and all those things. But be careful. Do not consider the narrator's and protagonist's chatter throughout the film as the words of a wise man. What you are listening to are the thoughts of a psychopath. Such human beings consider themselves to be the centre of the universe and who know exactly what's right and wrong. Everything they do is the right thing. About 2% of all men are psychopaths. Just a few examples of how wrong he is:Within the first 15 minutes, he chatters about1. DNA in the 21st century and his way of leaving no DNA behind.But the fact is that there is no way to avoid DNA residue nowadays if the person is in a room for more than 20 minutes. And he even spent a few days in the same room.2. He mentions survival of the fittest while being a professional killer who kills anyone for money, no matter how that person fits into the environment. So he does exactly the opposite of what he is preaching about.3. He explains the importance of his rules, such as: Have no empathy. Do not trust anyone. Always stay focused. Don't improvise. Never miss a given chance. But he listens to music on earphones during a sniper shot that he has been waiting for several days. And misses the target. Listening to music not only keeps the mind from wandering, it keeps the mind from staying focussed as well.He shows characteristic signs of psychopathy in the scene with Tilda Swinton at the table inside the restaurant. (The following description is not me describing him in that scene. It is a textbook version of the
'psychopathic stare' ): A wide-eyed stare, with more of the white of the eye showing, with reduced blinking, dilated pupils, and eye contact or 'fixation' held for longer. A focus that feels predatory or threatening. That's precisely what he does when he sits at the table with her.By the way, what she is telling him inside the restaurant is what the real plot of the movie is: he tries to fix his bruised ego and she is right about that. He is not on revenge because his wife was attacked. Persons like him can't really love anyone other than themselves. He doesn't caress her, kiss her or show any other sign of real love.Nobody said this movie was about a perfect killer or hero. Fincher created a portrait of a killer who is a psychopath without any conscience. And the viewer is invited to watch him at work.A movie in the manner of David Fincher - unique and misinterpreted by many people.","brilliant acting Michael Fassbender work director David Fincher create atmosphere constant tension , also camera angles , lighting things . careful . consider narrator 's protagonist 's chatter throughout film words wise man . listening thoughts psychopath . human beings consider centre universe know exactly 's right wrong .

The_Killer,"Following a failed assassination, the hired killer (Michael Fassbender) deals with the fallout and works his way through the chain of individuals involved in the assassination process.The Killer is the long awaited adaptation of the French comic book of the same name by writer Matz and artist Luc Jacamon that had been a pet project of David Fincher's since 2007 when it stalled in development with Paramount and was briefly considered as a reteam for Fincher and Brad Pitt, the latter of whom turned down the role due to how dark the material was. Using his established clout with Netflix Fincher revived the project with Michael Fasbender in the lead. Fincher and writer Andrew Kevin Walker have done a commendable job of taking the tried and true hired killer action template and given us a contemplative and stylish character study that subverts many of the established tropes.Largely eschewing dialogue exchanges, The Killer sees itself primarily based around the inner monologues of the nameless Killer with Fassbender projecting a cool, collected, and detached approach to his ugly line of work with much of the early focus on the tedium the Killer experiences simply waiting for his target to show up. During the long stretches where the Killer keeps himself occupied we get some interesting and engaging insights into his character as he describes his job of killing people with a sense of boredom and ennui where it's mostly a mundane aspect of his life and the only sparks coming from when he's charged with more creative murders. The movie makes no claims that the Killer is anything but a coldhearted murderer with the only real ""kindness"" he provides is murdering someone in a way that will guarantee their children get the life insurance. The film is beautifully shot with Erik Messerschmidt's cinematography doing well in showcasing the various locales The Killer traverses throughout the running time. Those going in expecting something along the lines of a Jason Statham or John Wick movie will be disappointed as there's only one proper action set piece while the actual content of the film is more psychological in execution.The Killer takes a well trodden formula and takes it from a different angle that isn't as explored as more conventional genre fare. For those with an affinity for the likes of Le Samourai, The Driver, and Drive you'll find an engaging and stylish character study that's well-made, thoughtfully written, and engagingly acted.","Following failed assassination , hired killer ( Michael Fassbender ) deals fallout works way chain individuals involved assassination process.The Killer long awaited adaptation French comic book name writer Matz artist Luc Jacamon pet project David Fincher 's since 2007 stalled development Paramount briefly considered reteam Fincher Brad Pitt , latter turned role due dark material .

The_Killer,"When seeing the trailer I thought, ""Yes, this has potential. It doesn't seem like a Jason Bourne or a Liam Neeson (Taken) type of one-dimentional main character, maybe it's more like Leon (the Professional) or stone cold like Kevin Costner in Mr Brooks."" But no. It wasn't. It's about revenge and the narrated inner voice of the do:s & don't:s that we're bombarded with gets old and tiring very fast.To me it felt more like a linear mission in a computer game where the character is just does follows a narrow corridor until the mission is over. I just didn't get it. The guy should be stone cold and apathetic, but he's not, he should be non-conspicuous but he's not, he should be careful and methodical in his every approach, but he's not. Now I'm of course no professional hired hitman but to me it felt like a miracle and highly implausible that he was a experienced pro that hadn't got caught during his +10.000h of work.My main comparison is Leon who lives a quiet loner life, who's somewhat socially inept, who's naive but yet really good at what he does. And we understand his past and how that had shaped him together with the relationship he has with his employer. The Killer had none of that unfortunately.

The_Killer,"'The Killer' is a stylish action thriller starring Michael Fassbender as the titular Killer, who goes on a killing spree killing assassins after an attack on his girlfriend. So, this is sort of a vengeance story.Did I say stylish? Ok, that means slow and a bit boring. Did I say 'action thriller'? Well, the action is few and far between. There's quite a bit of narration here, though. Hmmm, did I say 'quite a bit'? Well, actually a hell of a lot throughout the entire movie. In fact, the film's first 15 minutes sees the Killer telling us about statistics, metrics, his life, the meaning of life, his perception of various elements of life, and a bit on politics. Yup, and all the time we watch him watching the building opposite him - as he patiently waits for his target to show up.When the target finally shows up and the moment is perfect for the assassination, the Killer misses his target in a matter of a millisecond, killing a bystander in the process. The Killer immediately senses being followed, and goes on the run using various aliases. When he arrives at his home in the Dominican Republic and finds his girlfriend brutally attacked - but alive - he vows to go after those responsible.Oh, darn, I it happened; I just yawned! Ok, so this film wasn't really boring, but it did move a bit slow, and quite honestly I just didn't find it compelling. It wasn't always clear (to me, at least) who he was after. Yeah, I knew he was after assassins, but it felt like random characters appearing in the film just for a bit of action. Without any background on any of these characters, I simply viewed them as one-dimensional targets.Apart from that, there was very little action. There was ONE chase sequence, and only ONE good fight sequence - which happened to be so dark that I could hardly see what was happening. There never really was a clear antagonist, and no protagonist either. I suppose the film wants us to view the Killer as the protagonist, but I didn't. He was simply the film's lead, and by no means did I see him as a hero. The mere fact that he didn't even have a name - and called The Killer which in itself is negative - didn't really make me root for him; not as I would have wanted to had he in fact been an innocent victim.Michael Fassbender was good in his role, and he is in excellent physical shape. Pity they didn't put his good shape to better use. And all the (repetitive) narration was a bit too much... Oh, and did you also happen to spot all the sponsors in the movie?

The_Killer,"I was ready to love 'The Killer'. David Finchley Directing. Michael Fassbender and Tilda Swinton. What's not to like?But like it, I didn't. I found it to be - with certain exceptions - boring and repetitive. So much so that I was tempted to turn it off after only some fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes during which nothing happens (and yes, I know, that was the point of those minutes) with a droning voice-over that made those fifteen minutes seem like hours.Michael Fassbender plays a hired assassin who travels to Paris to kill a man. He fails at his job and so he, himself, becomes the target of those who'd originally hired him. After all, he failed, he knows who hired him .... he's a liability.The rest of the film deals with (a) What those who hired him do in their attempts to kill him, and (b) what he - the assassin - does to escape and wreak vengeance on them.And if this seems like a good film ... well, it's not. It's dark, too dark. The voice-over continues and never becomes any more tolerable. Characters are killed. But not all deserved to die (my opinion), Other characters do not die. And I have no idea why not. I was left cold by the film. I never once knew about whom to care. After all, the vengeful assassin is no boy-scout himself.

The_Killer,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of Fincher's movies, especially his early ones. His latest ones have not been for me. Mank (2020) was a vanity project for Fincher, and The Killer obviously a vanity project for Fassbender.I certainly wasn't expecting a balls to the wall action movie, that's not Fincher's style. What we got was the worst of Fincher: Style over substance, a simplistic plot and zero characters. Fincher is a lot like Stanley Kubrick and Christopher Nolan in that way. Great visual directors but detached emotionally.The main problem with The Killer is that I don't really care about the character, which also means that I don't care about what happens to him or those supposedly close to him. I suppose the filmmakers would argue that him not letting the audience in is intentional. But that also means that the one thing that supposedly drives the entire movie from the second act - The Killer avenging his girlfriend - doesn't work. Fassbender drones on and on about how empathy is weakness and to trust no one, yet we are supposed to believe he cares about his girlfriend we know absolutely nothing about? John Wick meting out justice to those who killed his puppy makes more sense, however preposterous that may sound, because we have seen that he actually cares about his dog.And as Brian Cox says in Adaptation (2002): ""God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends. God help you. That's flaccid, sloppy writing. Any idiot can write a voice-over narration to explain the thoughts of a character.""In its procedural style manner, I guess the one of Fincher's other movies it comes closest to is Zodiac (2007) which, incidentally, is one of my favorites. Some people have compared it to Le Samouraï (1967) with Alain Delon, I personally think it feels more akin to Edward Fox's arc in The Day of the Jackal (1973), a far superior movie.","First , 'm huge fan Fincher 's movies , especially early ones . latest ones .

The_Killer,"David Fincher wisely selected Michael Fassbender for his generic titled hitman movie. Fassbender carries it at all times. Title aside this is fascinating hit gone wrong tale. I'm totally uncertain how realistic this might be and that means it's acceptable as it is played out quite morosely. It lives in an old saying, ""those who live by the knife, die by the knife"". By slowly building the drama the viewer invests more and more.Fassbender's Mank character builds his cold lack of humanity until he becomes the hunted causing him to seek a personal vendetta. By the time of Fassbender's failing, and particularly through his detached narrative and sparse dialogue, you have doubt that his unrelenting discipline will see him through.It's quite an achievement when as a viewer you can root for such depravity to, more or less, win. This is because we never know if any of his victims really were so bad and devoid of empathy as he is constantly reminding himself he must be. Mank is almost impossible to like and this is another masterstroke for differentiating a hit man tale like few, if any. Surviving another day is Mank's thing and the proper ending leaves it open for that...or not. An excellent movie that never rushes and keeps the tension building.","David Fincher wisely selected Michael Fassbender generic titled hitman movie . Fassbender carries times .

The_Killer,"Someone commented about 20 years ago that David Fincher had a stroke of genius when he made the movie 'Seven'. I agree with that statement one hundred percent. One of the best movies ever made. Even though it's been 28 years since that movie, every time David makes a new film, my skin is tingling in anticipation. Although in the meantime he didn't deserve that anticipation, obviously, too many years have passed.... I'm old school.This 'The Killer'...I am speechless.

It is as if he is a novice amateur, in the first year of the film academy, who is trying to make his first work.'This' lasts almost 2 hours, and 80% of the action takes place in vehicles with the same song as the soundtrack. The voiceover is unbearable, the casting is completely missed. The plot is unbearable.

The_Killer,"If you like slow-moving 'thrillers' with darkly lit fight sequences, set to the sound of Morrissey bemoaning the miseries of life, then this is the movie for you. Unfortunately, it wasn't for me. And for a number of reasons (Not a huge Smiths fan, but at least that part was tolerable).First of all, the audience has no reason to care about the lead character. He's fastidious in preparation and philosophy, but woefully incompetent in practice. You might have thought that would engender pity, if nothing else. But the snail's pace and the all-too-convenient plot progressions (when they periodically appear) had me looking at my watch far sooner than any audience member ought have to do. I was put in mind of ""The Mechanic"" which also begins quite slowly. But in that film, the filmmakers had the sense to keep Charles Bronson quiet throughout the opening preparations, and not narrate his deep thoughts about life.The existential quandary of a blundering professional killer might have worked if it had been played as parody. The running gag of the fake IDs kind of gives that feeling (after all how can someone who plans so carefully, possibly leave a trail of receipts with the names of 70s and 80s TV stars, and NOT expect to be tracked?). But there's nothing else to indicate humor. Except perhaps unintentionally. There is a ludicrous, dimly lit fight scene with may actually benefit from the audience not really seeing much of it. I suspect it would have looked even more ridiculous with good lighting.","like slow-moving 'thrillers ' darkly lit fight sequences , set sound Morrissey bemoaning miseries life , movie .

The_Killer,"Greetings again from the darkness. There is a reason I choose not to interview directors, writers, actors, or anyone else involved with the movies I watch and review. It's because I prefer to evaluate based on what we see on screen rather than whether it's the product of someone likable or not, quick witted or not, or passionate about their work or not. Anytime I start to waver on this approach, I'm quickly reminded why the decision was made. David Fincher is unquestionably one of the finest filmmakers working today. His work includes such films as SEVEN (1995), THE GAME (1997), FIGHT CLUB (1999), PANIC ROOM (2002), ZODIAC (2007), THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010), THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2011), GONE GIRL (2014), and MANK (2020). Despite this remarkable resume of successful films, each new one deserves to be judged on its own ... there is no extra credit for past brilliance.The all-too-brief and remarkably cool opening credit sequence sets the stage for a film that looks absolutely marvelous. This leads us to an extended opening sequence where we learn about our titular cold-blooded assassin played by Michael Fassbender. It's through his redundant narration that we learn about his meticulous and detail-oriented approach to a job that has made him a very wealthy man. He listens to various songs by The Smiths, does yoga in the dark, and repeats his mantras to keep himself centered and focused on the job at hand. After all, he cautions us that this job is only for those who can handle boredom - as if committing cold-blooded murder is somehow a more natural trait than handling down time on the job.Getting to know the quirks and nature of this hitman is actually the highlight of the movie, because he botches this job in the worst possible manner, and then must step outside his norm to handle this 'new' development. When he discovers that his partner has been seriously wounded as fallout for his blown job, the Killer conveniently drops his 'nothing personal' mantra and proceeds to pursue very personal revenge.SEVEN screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker has adapted the graphic novel written by Alexis Nolent and illustrated by Luc Jacamon, and Fincher is clearly having fun with the material. It's not accurate to call this a dark comedy, but there are some comedic elements included to lighten things up a bit. Most of these struck me as a bit lame: shots at our societal dependence on name brands (Amazon, WeWork, Starbucks, etc), the Killer's disguise as a 'German tourist', and the endless string of 1970's sitcom names used in his travels (think ""The Odd Couple"", ""Happy Days"", and even ""The Partridge Family"").To ensure no viewer is left behind, the film is divided into six chapters highlighted by the geographic location and the reason for being there: Paris - the Target, Dominican Republic - the hangout, New Orleans - the lawyer, Florida - the brute, New York - the expert, and Chicago - the client. Each of these chapters involves a piece of the revenge puzzle, and include fine actors Charles Parnell, Tilda Swinton, and Arliss Howard. Ms. Swinton's segment offers the most, but her presence is over much too soon. It's the mano-y-mano fight with the brute that is the weakest, since the fight is so over-the-top that neither would walk away ... yet Killer departs with only a scratch over his eye.While most of the story seems too familiar and kind of ludicrous, the film itself is a work of art. Fassbender perfectly captures the icy killer, and Oscar winning cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt (MANK, 2020) delivers in the multitude of locales, as well as the action shots. Two-time Oscar winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross handle the score of this film that will undoubtedly be regarded more highly by most other critics than by me, since a line like WWJWBD simply falls flat in my mind.Opens in theaters on October 27, 2023.","Greetings darkness . reason choose interview directors , writers , actors , anyone else involved movies watch review .

The_Killer,"The worst, most boring and stupidest killer film I've ever seen, and I'm not a fan of mindless films, on the contrary, I like films with a good story. This one uses all the clichés but with the disadvantage that this super professional assassin is very stupid, just like everyone else he encounters. The terrible script is full of holes, I won't mention all of them to avoid spoilers, but, for example, this protagonist invades the house of another assassin, 2 times his size, to kill him, just with a pistol, he doesn't even take an extra gun or knife and he almost gets killed. But this protagonist's girlfriend managed to hurt this killer and escape from this huge killer who was still with another killer. In fact, these killers went to kill the super killer at his house in the Dominican Republic by taxi... lol. Not to mention that the agency that hires these killers has the address of all of their homes and they continue to live there...lol. Oh, and the secretary of that assassin agency has the name and address of all the assassins and contractors on little paper cards in her suburban house... in her office, not even in a vault.... that's it.The office that hires dangerous assassins and sometimes orders them to be killed has no security and no armed guards. In fact, these killers break into sophisticated security systems but there is no security at all in their homes... lol. Serious error that is also in John Wick 1.""Professional"" killers don't realize when they are being followed by car or when there is a car parked in front of their house for hours, with a person inside.The apartment of the millionaire who hired the killer, which the millionaire himself says is the height of security, uses access to the garage elevator and the apartment with a magnetic card without a password. Even in my country town, access from several buildings to the garage elevator already has facial scanning to avoid this.These are just some of the huge inconsistencies that, together with a boring voice over, which adds nothing to the plot, make this film have the most stupid murderers in history.. The first 20 minutes are boring and I just didn't put the film down because of the names involved but I wish I had stopped in the first 10 minutes...
David Fincher like Ridley Scott are great technical directors who are not Authors, they depend on a good script to make good films and they don't always know how to evaluate their scripts. Many praise Fincher for his aesthetics, but that's not being authorial, it's just being stylistically technical. And it totally depends on the Director of Photography and the Art Director, and on having a good budget for it.","worst , boring stupidest killer film 've ever seen , 'm fan mindless films , contrary , like films good story . one uses clichés disadvantage super professional assassin stupid , like everyone else encounters . terrible script full holes , wo n't mention avoid spoilers , , example , protagonist invades house another assassin , 2 times size , kill , pistol , n't even take extra gun knife almost gets killed . protagonist 's girlfriend managed hurt killer escape huge killer still another killer . fact , killers went kill super killer house Dominican Republic taxi ... lol . mention agency hires killers address homes continue live ... lol .

The_Killer,"There are slow-burn films that take their time, make the journey meticulous, deliberately, with every frame existing for a reason. Just like with any other film style, those can be good, mediocre or bad.The Killer is definitely on the mediocre to bad end of the spectrum.There's nothing terribly wrong with the movie: the story is simple and trite but workable, the script is passable and even decent at times, a couple of the characters have a touch of personality (save for the protagonist), and the direction is OK.

The_Killer,"The Killer showcases a different, almost more ""realistic"" form of assassin in a world where John Wick and James Bond exists. I appreciate the moments where the character exists within his own head. It is only logical that an assassin would suffer from intense anxiety. However, the film suffers a Netflix death. Im not entirely sure why but it doesnt feel in-depth and of a high standard, its as if Netflix provided enough budget to have the film appear presentable at surface without enough to fuel the rest. Perhaps it just lacks originality. Its a conglomeration of concepts we've seen before and it doesnt accentuate any specific idea to its fullest. If you want a film about a killer on the run, you raise the intensity and provide the sense that that character is being followed. We only get this for a 5 minute period until that idea is flipped on its head. There's absolutely no thrilling sense in the Killer as it's just too slow and lacks any actual attempt at being a thriller. Yet the slowed moments within the film are at times used well. We see the ""protagonist"" analysing locations to prepare for his kill. Yet there is no commentary over these sections relating to details and so the viewer has to use there imagination with no insight.I have played the Hitman games which at a rough description fits the premise of the film quite well. Yet the film simply lacks creativity in comparison. Theres no ""fun"", its bleak at times and boring throughout. I had the patience to sit through it but i didnt want to be there by the end. Michael Fassbender puts in a strong performance but no other character has remotely enough time to become convincing in their roles. Once again its logical that an assassin would be a lone worker but then hes got a second life with a woman who he still remains the same character with. We dont get to see another side to Fassbender's killer but is that just the reality of an assassin? I just feel that Netflix is attempting to appease to this ""sigma"" form of character following the success of their Jeffrey Dahmer serie. This kind of character only works well rarely as becoming used to it removes its uniqueness and i feel as if that has been lost.","Killer showcases different , almost `` realistic '' form assassin world John Wick James Bond exists . appreciate moments character exists within head . logical assassin would suffer intense anxiety .

The_Killer,"As a major fan of Fincher and his regular crew, it saddens me to find this effort fell flat and left no lasting impact. Striking an emotional chord is a forte of our director with works like 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and 'The Social Network' under his belt where character building is flawlessly executed. For 'The Killer', however, it's difficult to connect with our protagonist.The good: an intriguing setup, eery score, and believable skill set from an experienced actor (while maybe not the best choice).The bad: a very unnecessary & snarky narration throughout that greatly impaired the aesthetic, confusing use of music which didn't marry with the story feel or voice of... ""Mr. Killer"" (like constantly taking off and putting on headphones with an edgy, modern rock playlist on a discovery shuffle), conflicting tone of voice and intentions from the lead, no understanding of his personal relationships, and ultimately a lack of stakes for someone who seemingly has little-to-no care for human life.There was a lot of potential with this film and perhaps there's a better version out there somewhere with additional scenes that could clear up some of the many questions the audience likely has walking out of 'The Killer' (such as ""that was it?"" or ""what was the point of that?""). However, this effort felt rushed and sadly lacked the flavor & gravity of a masterful David Fincher film like 'Fight Club'. Keep your expectations very low, I can almost guarantee they won't be met. 5/10.","major fan Fincher regular crew , saddens find effort fell flat left lasting impact .

The_Killer,"The first botched assassination was slow to set up and stupid. If your big plan is to find an apartment directly across the street from your target, and then assume the target never closes the curtains, you have a stupid plan. Then there remains the question of why he didn't take a second shot (even though the first shot may have gone through the hooker and hit the target. It's most likely a 50. Cal round that can go through both sides of a brick house).The music was annoying, or I should say the way the music was played in the loud-muffled gimmick. I just wanted it to stop. I can never listen to The Smiths again without thinking of this weak movie.Speaking of sound, I got so sick of him repeating his little life lessons that he took from Chicken Soup for the Psychopath.OMG, he kills a number of people, but he keeps a watchdog alive? First with some cockamamy sleeping potion, then he doesn't shoot the thing after he just blew a dude's brains out. This is typical Hollywood morality. John Wick kills over 400 humans, but he's nice to dogs so it's OK.The Killer rates a 1 on IMDb because Tilda Swinden tells a really old joke that everyone has heard...and she dragged it out. As she was telling it with all the embellishments a person with zero sense of humor often uses in telling jokes (also only for the humor-impaired) I was begging her to stop. It was embarrassing to watch.How could the director have such a hard-on for a comic book when the story is so thin and stupid? There wasn't much of a story. Revenge because his maid or someone got beat up (her status wasn't made clear until the end). This is a guy who murders people for a living. I guess you don't need to understand irony to be a hitman. He goes on and on about a need to remove empathy from your life skills, yet he does all this over a woman? Sorry, a complete lack of empathy means you can't pick and choose, you have no feelings for other humans, like Donald Trump, a guy who wouldn't miss a meal to save the life of a family member.The movie tries so hard to be slick and cool, and to make the killer out of be such a pro, but a lot of it is silly and amateurish. He throws a phone down on the sidewalk and steps on it, throws evidence away in the closest receptacle he can find, waits around in his car like a pervo as if no one will notice in a residential neighborhood. Someone comes to the door unexpectedly and he is ready with a sniper rifle? He doesn't have a sidearm for back-up? In close quarters, I'd rather have a cast iron skillet than an unwieldy rifle. He flees the botched hit on a moped but in such a panic that he attracts police attention far from the scene. This didn't add tension, it added dumb.The fight scene in Florida was horribly choreographed and took forever, besides the fact that it was so dark you could barely tell if they were fighting or dancing.The happily ever after ending was such a cop out, especially in this film that wanted so desperately to be noir. I was waiting for the piña colada song in the closing credits.","first botched assassination slow set stupid . big plan find apartment directly across street target , assume target never closes curtains , stupid plan . remains question n't take second shot ( even though first shot may gone hooker hit target .

The_Killer,"If you like slow-moving 'thrillers' with darkly lit fight sequences, set to the sound of Morrissey bemoaning the miseries of life, then this is the movie for you. Unfortunately, it wasn't for me. And for a number of reasons (Not a huge Smiths fan, but at least that part was tolerable).First of all, the audience has no reason to care about the lead character. He's fastidious in preparation and philosophy, but woefully incompetent in practice. You might have thought that would engender pity, if nothing else. But the snail's pace and the all-too-convenient plot progressions (when they periodically appear) had me looking at my watch far sooner than any audience member ought have to do. I was put in mind of ""The Mechanic"" which also begins quite slowly. But in that film, the filmmakers had the sense to keep Charles Bronson quiet throughout the opening preparations, and not narrate his deep thoughts about life.The existential quandary of a blundering professional killer might have worked if it had been played as parody. The running gag of the fake IDs kind of gives that feeling (after all how can someone who plans so carefully, possibly leave a trail of receipts with the names of 70s and 80s TV stars, and NOT expect to be tracked?). But there's nothing else to indicate humor. Except perhaps unintentionally. There is a ludicrous, dimly lit fight scene with may actually benefit from the audience not really seeing much of it. I suspect it would have looked even more ridiculous with good lighting.","like slow-moving 'thrillers ' darkly lit fight sequences , set sound Morrissey bemoaning miseries life , movie .

The_Killer,"The worst, most boring and stupidest killer film I've ever seen, and I'm not a fan of mindless films, on the contrary, I like films with a good story. This one uses all the clichés but with the disadvantage that this super professional assassin is very stupid, just like everyone else he encounters. The terrible script is full of holes, I won't mention all of them to avoid spoilers, but, for example, this protagonist invades the house of another assassin, 2 times his size, to kill him, just with a pistol, he doesn't even take an extra gun or knife and he almost gets killed. But this protagonist's girlfriend managed to hurt this killer and escape from this huge killer who was still with another killer. In fact, these killers went to kill the super killer at his house in the Dominican Republic by taxi... lol. Not to mention that the agency that hires these killers has the address of all of their homes and they continue to live there...lol. Oh, and the secretary of that assassin agency has the name and address of all the assassins and contractors on little paper cards in her suburban house... in her office, not even in a vault.... that's it.The office that hires dangerous assassins and sometimes orders them to be killed has no security and no armed guards. In fact, these killers break into sophisticated security systems but there is no security at all in their homes... lol. Serious error that is also in John Wick 1.""Professional"" killers don't realize when they are being followed by car or when there is a car parked in front of their house for hours, with a person inside.The apartment of the millionaire who hired the killer, which the millionaire himself says is the height of security, uses access to the garage elevator and the apartment with a magnetic card without a password. Even in my country town, access from several buildings to the garage elevator already has facial scanning to avoid this.These are just some of the huge inconsistencies that, together with a boring voice over, which adds nothing to the plot, make this film have the most stupid murderers in history.. The first 20 minutes are boring and I just didn't put the film down because of the names involved but I wish I had stopped in the first 10 minutes...
David Fincher like Ridley Scott are great technical directors who are not Authors, they depend on a good script to make good films and they don't always know how to evaluate their scripts. Many praise Fincher for his aesthetics, but that's not being authorial, it's just being stylistically technical. And it totally depends on the Director of Photography and the Art Director, and on having a good budget for it.","worst , boring stupidest killer film 've ever seen , 'm fan mindless films , contrary , like films good story . one uses clichés disadvantage super professional assassin stupid , like everyone else encounters . terrible script full holes , wo n't mention avoid spoilers , , example , protagonist invades house another assassin , 2 times size , kill , pistol , n't even take extra gun knife almost gets killed . protagonist 's girlfriend managed hurt killer escape huge killer still another killer . fact , killers went kill super killer house Dominican Republic taxi ... lol . mention agency hires killers address homes continue live ... lol .

Just like with any other film style, those can be good, mediocre or bad.The Killer is definitely on the mediocre to bad end of the spectrum.There's nothing terribly wrong with the movie: the story is simple and trite but workable, the script is passable and even decent at times, a couple of the characters have a touch of personality (save for the protagonist), and the direction is OK. The problem is that there isn't anything particularly good, or simply good, about The Killer. Nothing ever stands out and that's aggravated by the cardinal mistake that no form of entertainment should be guilty of: being boring. The Killer is indeed a boring film. Not because it's a slow-burn, but because it's really, really flat, with little to nothing ever eliciting any emotions or much engagement at all from the viewer.","slow-burn films take time , make journey meticulous , deliberately , every frame existing reason . like film style , good , mediocre bad.The Killer definitely mediocre bad end spectrum.There 's nothing terribly wrong movie : story simple trite workable , script passable even decent times , couple characters touch personality ( save protagonist ) , direction OK . problem n't anything particularly good , simply good , Killer .

The_Killer,"The Killer showcases a different, almost more ""realistic"" form of assassin in a world where John Wick and James Bond exists. I appreciate the moments where the character exists within his own head. It is only logical that an assassin would suffer from intense anxiety. However, the film suffers a Netflix death. Im not entirely sure why but it doesnt feel in-depth and of a high standard, its as if Netflix provided enough budget to have the film appear presentable at surface without enough to fuel the rest. Perhaps it just lacks originality. Its a conglomeration of concepts we've seen before and it doesnt accentuate any specific idea to its fullest. If you want a film about a killer on the run, you raise the intensity and provide the sense that that character is being followed. We only get this for a 5 minute period until that idea is flipped on its head. There's absolutely no thrilling sense in the Killer as it's just too slow and lacks any actual attempt at being a thriller. Yet the slowed moments within the film are at times used well. We see the ""protagonist"" analysing locations to prepare for his kill. Yet there is no commentary over these sections relating to details and so the viewer has to use there imagination with no insight.I have played the Hitman games which at a rough description fits the premise of the film quite well. Yet the film simply lacks creativity in comparison. Theres no ""fun"", its bleak at times and boring throughout. I had the patience to sit through it but i didnt want to be there by the end. Michael Fassbender puts in a strong performance but no other character has remotely enough time to become convincing in their roles. Once again its logical that an assassin would be a lone worker but then hes got a second life with a woman who he still remains the same character with. We dont get to see another side to Fassbender's killer but is that just the reality of an assassin? I just feel that Netflix is attempting to appease to this ""sigma"" form of character following the success of their Jeffrey Dahmer serie. This kind of character only works well rarely as becoming used to it removes its uniqueness and i feel as if that has been lost.","Killer showcases different , almost `` realistic '' form assassin world John Wick James Bond exists . appreciate moments character exists within head . logical assassin would suffer intense anxiety .

The_Killer,"As a major fan of Fincher and his regular crew, it saddens me to find this effort fell flat and left no lasting impact. Striking an emotional chord is a forte of our director with works like 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and 'The Social Network' under his belt where character building is flawlessly executed. For 'The Killer', however, it's difficult to connect with our protagonist.The good: an intriguing setup, eery score, and believable skill set from an experienced actor (while maybe not the best choice).The bad: a very unnecessary & snarky narration throughout that greatly impaired the aesthetic, confusing use of music which didn't marry with the story feel or voice of... ""Mr. Killer"" (like constantly taking off and putting on headphones with an edgy, modern rock playlist on a discovery shuffle), conflicting tone of voice and intentions from the lead, no understanding of his personal relationships, and ultimately a lack of stakes for someone who seemingly has little-to-no care for human life.There was a lot of potential with this film and perhaps there's a better version out there somewhere with additional scenes that could clear up some of the many questions the audience likely has walking out of 'The Killer' (such as ""that was it?"" or ""what was the point of that?""). However, this effort felt rushed and sadly lacked the flavor & gravity of a masterful David Fincher film like 'Fight Club'. Keep your expectations very low, I can almost guarantee they won't be met. 5/10.","major fan Fincher regular crew , saddens find effort fell flat left lasting impact .

The main character's inner monologue reminds me of a teenager who just read ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" for the first time.

He's doing his slow methodical process for his next job, but the shot goes wrong.This is based on the French graphic novel and directed by David Fincher. It's cold. Narration is not my favorite cinematic trope when it's done in this unfeeling fashion. It's meant to be his insightful interior monologue. Instead, his tone leaves me hypnotized and sleepy. I missed the taxi kill during my first watch. The movie does get me with some very compelling sections starting with the lawyer kill. The best scene has to be Tilda Swinton.

The_Killer,"David Fincher's contemporary thriller ""The Killer"" isn't cut from the same cliches as conventional B-movie hitman epics. This film is wired with the same offbeat vibe of a John Huston thriller. The events appear almost surreal during some moments, and then surprisingly violent at other times. The ending felt curiously anti-climactic, a letdown after the protagonist's Herculean labors set things right. Indeed, I wanted an ending with more bite. For example, ""The Killer"" lacks the ending of Michael Winner's ""The Mechanic"" (1969) with Charles Bronson. Quibbles aside, I enjoyed watching Fincher's straightforward, but suspenseful action-adventure opus. Moreover, I appreciated Finch's decision to share the protagonist's interior monologues with the spectator. Not only does this flesh out this ruthless predator's nature, but it also provides deeper insight into what makes this bastard tick! You won't feel inclined to identify with the eponymous gunman because he lacks charisma. Rarely does he laugh and display a genuine jovial sense of humor. Michael Fassbender is largely contemplative-obsessive might be a better description--as he recites a litany of rules and regs which would make a manual for assassins. Again, we hear his thoughts as he reminds himself to ""Anticipate, Don't Improvise."" Interestingly, neither Fincher nor his writer Andrew Kevin Walker of ""Se7en"" identify their protagonist by name. When a character has no name, an aura of mystery emerges around him. At the same time, a character without a name amounts to an everyman. Literally, this assassin is everybody and nobody. Incidentally, Fincher & Walker adapted the graphic novel series 'The Killer' scripted by French writer Alexis Nolent and illustrated by Luc Jacamon. No, since I haven't read their novel, I cannot comment about the fidelity of the film to its source material.""The Killer"" unfolds with the same clinical efficiency that its nameless protagonist wields from fade-in to fadeout. In Paris, France, an elite assassin bides his time for the fateful moment when he will pull the trigger on his quarry in a building situated across from his own some fifty yards away. Mind you, that's a rough estimate. When I watch ""The Killer"" again, I will scrutinize the distance more closely. Anyhow, the first act of Fincher's murderous but methodical melodrama introduces us to a cold-blooded assassin who knows his business inside and out. A painstaking professional, he waits patiently for the split-second to ice his victim. Meticulous might better describe his behavior. With ""The Killer,"" Fincher plunges int0 full-blown Michael Mann mode. This slick, somber, but serious crime yarn not only shuns comic relief but also shirks frilly romantic escapades. After impressing us with his vast knowledge of murder and the elements involved in getting away with murder, including a wristwatch that dictates the exact moment to fire based on a favorable blood pressure reading. This man has more money and guns than you can imagine! As far as hitman movies go, ""The Killer"" forges a whole new standard, and yet it reminded me of Jean-Pierre Melville's ""Le Samurai"" (1967), with Alain Delon. Incredibly, our killer misses the shot and suffers the consequences. Sloppy, you might say, but a lot like the British assassin in Fred Zinnemann's ""The Day of the Jackal"" (1973). The 'Jackal' is a hired British mercenary who lines General De Gaulle up in the crosshairs but misses! He didn't expect the General would lean to one side and kiss his French compatriot! Culture rears its ugly head here. The British assassin is handicapped by a culture he doesn't grasp. In ""The Killer,"" a prostitute in a fetching black outfit crosses in front of the target and suffers instant death from our protagonist's bullet. AS I mentioned earlier, this span of time covers Act One.Act Two chronicles our protagonist's efforts to cover his tracks and eliminate anybody who may be coming after him for missing the shot. Predictably, Fincher and his writer bring these two people face to face before Act Three. Act Two takes up the most time in this 118-minute pulse pounder. We get to admire our hero's sense of professionalism. He has myriad identities and loads of currency. The second act brings the action closer to him. He owns an estate in South America and the people who apparently hired him dispatch some thuggish types to ransack his estate and beat his woman to within an inch of her life. She is faithful to him and worried while in the hospital that she might inadvertently spew forth incriminating information about her lover. There are several visceral, close quarters combat scenes. Ultimately, the last of his challenging adversaries (played with grace and wit by Oscar-winning actress Tilda Swinton of ""Michael Clayton"") almost takes him down. Finally, Act Three shows our hero relaxing in a lawn chair to admire the weather in a ending that rewards more than punishes our amoral protagonist.","David Fincher 's contemporary thriller `` Killer '' n't cut cliches conventional B-movie hitman epics . film wired offbeat vibe John Huston thriller . events appear almost surreal moments , surprisingly violent times . ending felt curiously anti-climactic , letdown protagonist 's Herculean labors set things right .

The_Killer,"This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Everything that happens is completely predictable. The killer doesn't act like a professional, but like a bloody novice - even after he has committed the crime. In the real world, he would have been found out after 10 minutes. The worst thing, however, is the very long and boring monologue at the beginning of the movie, which lasts more than 10 minutes and is completely superfluous.I strongly advise against watching this movie because not only will you be bored, but it's like being taken for a ride and then remembering that you fell for it. The movie just acts so smart and is so stupid and primitive.","one boring movies 've ever seen .

He is so miserably running from police sirens that you'd want to tell him to breathe, calm down and not break driving rules (duh!) or he will surely get caught. So much for him not giving a f$&@ to anything. 15 minutes and series of event later he is in hospital with his girlfriend who is seriously injured and almost in coma.

The_Killer,"I can't decide if this movie was created out of spite, or by A. I.Lets start with the opening scene, our 'hero' uses a rifle with subsonic rounds to take out a fat bloke in Paris. Our 'expert' assassin mentions at the distance there will be no bullet drop, so I can assume it will be traveling at close to the speed of sound. Of course a Parisian prostitute stopped the bullet. Even in this world where women are made of Kevlar, a semi automatic rifle would have solved the issue. Again, he mentioned the close distance so no need for a bolt action.When stalking the Floridian, the main character says there should be a 30 day waiting period for creatine. I wonder how this would work... You go to the supermarket and order your chicken for next month? Sorry sir, due to your criminal conviction in 2008 I can't serve you this fillet of salmon. I think the writers may have meant steroids. But still dumb.The MC kills everyone without emotion but leaves the last guy alive for some reason. He literally killed a taxi driver because he saw his face, but the final guy is free to go.The part where he goes into the gym and mentions the bodyguard isn't Mossad irked me. How does he know? The guy could literally be checking his phone, do Mossad agents have magic Jewish telepathy that I'm unaware of so have no need for phones?The other assassins travel by private plane, which makes it easier to do shady stuff. The MC flies cattle class. Why?Back to the Floridian - He is an assassin who's only weapon is a nightstand Glock? I have known normal Floridians who have a firearm in ever room and one in their truck. Also, our emotionless killer can't shoot a dog for some reason.What is with the crazy amount of product placement.The gun seller says something like ""Damn my boy knows his way around a sub compact glock"" - This genuinely made me laugh. I can't imagine having the balls to insult someone like this to their face. Also the micro-phallic silencer was hilarious.Finally, after killing a few people, he is free to sit by his pool with his spicy Latina wife - so there are zero consequences for what he did? There were two rolodexes filled with people in that industry. None of them are going to come for him... at his house... where they know he lives.Like I said, I feel like this movie was made out of spite, trying to be a cerebral action thriller that is somehow dumber than the competition.","ca n't decide movie created spite , A.

The_Killer,"Usually the viewer has to figure out, how to perceive the character through his actions. In this movie you get a manual in form of pointless, repetitive narration that tells you what to think. Unfortunately in this case the words don't describe what's on the screen, which results in disbelief after only a few minutes.Let's break down the first scene. -The ""killer"" enters a building to assassinate someone across the street, not shortly before the target arrives, no he gets there days earlier! Why? Did someone give him a wrong date?He then parades in front of a big window, makes almost friends with a lady across the street. When it's dark, he sits there too and turns the light towards his face to be seen. When he gets bored, he assembles his rifle that makes noises like a rusty door hinge, but has no time to oil it.He makes yoga exercises too, brushes his teeth and has a small spray bottle to destroy all the DNA he leaves behind. For some reason he uses his mouth to put gloves on.He also has a special custom made electric table that elevates assassins in the room, so they can lean comfortably and don't have to stand. This guy is prepared!Occasionally someone enters his apartment, to throw in letters by surprise. Our well organized killer has then to run with a big rifle and hide behind the corner, ready to shoot. When the danger is over, he disassembles his rifle back into small pieces, shortly before his target arrives.He then has to rush and prepare the rifle in a hurry, after spending days in the room. He can only shoot accompanied by music with ear plugs, because he doesn't have to be aware of what happens around him.Eventually he hits the wrong person.For some strange reason he remembers to reload after a while, but then it's too late. He leaves the room in panic, to reach his getaway electric Vespa, carefully secured with a digital lock, not even he can open!Suddenly there is police everywhere, but he acts like he is the only person in Paris and drives like a madman on his electric bike throwing parts of his rifle in spectacular fashion. Wow!Then there is the length of this movie. 120 minutes is a dead giveaway nowadays for a missing, boring plot. One can assume the script was written by AI in early beta stage.I give 1 star to every movie I'm unable to finish watching.

The_Killer,"Even before the brain-dead catalyst finally happens I was ready to turn off the movie after the seemingly endless voice-over by the main character.Sadly I stuck with it just long enough to realize this is yet another film that hopes the audience is too stupid to notice they didn't put any real thought into it.We are tricked into believing the contract killer is a cold, impersonal professional who knows how to hide and blend into his surroundings, yet he occupies his hide for days while leaving no doubt of his presence due to the large uncovered windows and twin-head work light illuminating him for all to see. The space is also presented as abandoned yet inexplicably receives a pile of mail for no other purpose than to force a ""tense"" moment that is anything but.When his inner monologue mercifully ends he is finally able to take his shot, even though he had far better opportunities much sooner. He reassembles his weapon yet again, because why would you keep it ready when the opportunity could come at any time? He gets set up, then begins tracking everyone in the room. Uh, no. You track your target and fire the moment the shot is available.He finally takes the shot even though the target's evening entertainment is gyrating in front of him and she of course steps into the path of the bullet as the trigger is pulled. Instead of remaining focused and squeezing off another round from the fully loaded magazine, the killer panics and flees in the most clumsy and obvious way possible.Not much of a professional.

The_Killer,The film starts off brilliantly. The feeling of suspense and the filming and editing feel slow and almost as if you are the hitman waiting and waiting. It felt almost refreshing from the onslaught of fast paced action films of today. However it soon turns Into just another assassin film and follows almost the exact narrative of most of them. The biggest problem with this film is that it really feels pointless. The narrative of the hitman has his wife beaten or killed so hunts the perpetrators down and kills them one by one has been done a hundred times before and dare I say it done better. I really wanted this film to be different but it just stuck to the same Hollywood hitman narrative script. There are some absolutely beautiful shots but the story just doesn't keep you interested and in the end you almost feel like what was the point of this whole film. Spoiler alert but it has a typical Hollywood ending where the main character lives happily ever after. I really wanted this to be different I really wanted it to have a mist ending that made you sit up and go holy Christ I didn't see that one coming.

The_Killer,"The Killer with no name in David Fincher's passion project of twenty years, ""The Killer,"" is a man of too many words and encyclopedic knowledge of nothing useful. Played by Michael Fassbender in a single note--A5, I think--he's accumulated lots of frequent-flier points, traveling across continents like some kind of amoral anchorite. The best that can be said about Fincher's passion in this project is that it's over in under two hours.Unhappily, on the way to its most probable conclusion, one must sit through Fassbender's blubbering stream of consciousness. Mistakenly labeled ""noir,"" apparently because Fincher has acquired expertise in this style, the narrative commits to its purpose as the Killer does his, mostly with obligatory voice-over narration, a filmmaker's last recourse to fill dead air.After all, a script with comic-book characters and a predictable plot needs some justification, since assassins skilled at efficient murdering rather than small talk, like those Charles Bronson pulled off effortlessly without self-analysis, offer writers fewer turns at displaying witty observations about German tourists and street mimes. And as assassins go, this one can't seem to get anything right: first missing his target, then--stepping out of an L. L. Bean catalog amidst basic-black Parisians--lurching his way to find ""the Client"" who hired him, who's retaliated, he thinks, by attacking his girlfriend. Take note: giving him a girlfriend is how a writer humanizes a killer, in accordance with ""A Screenwriter's Guide in 10 Easy Steps.""More stuck-up than cold-blooded, Fassbender never rises above the two-dimensional creation he's portraying. But he mustn't feel bad. He's in good company along with assorted clerks, waiters, ticket agents, taxi drivers, and stock players straight from central casting: the Lawyer, the Client, the Brute, and the Expert, expertly played by the book by a pallid and over-exposed image of Tilda Swinton, the Actor.","Killer name David Fincher 's passion project twenty years , `` Killer , '' man many words encyclopedic knowledge nothing useful .

The_Killer,"What a disappointment for Fincher fans. This film lacked any of the intelligence or creative storytelling we expect from the guy who gave us Seven and Fight Club.The Killer is a very straightforward revenge story. The problem is we don't get enough narrative to make us care. Who is the girl to him? What is the history?Instead, goes on his mission of retribution just checking off boxes and we plod along with him as he drones on in his monotone voiceover. Even when he reaches the top, he just stops and lets the guy off the hook.It is very understandable why this is on Netflix and not out in theaters.","disappointment Fincher fans . film lacked intelligence creative storytelling expect guy gave us Seven Fight Club.The Killer straightforward revenge story . problem n't get enough narrative make us care . girl ? history ?

I watched it because of Fincher, and though I had an increasing urge to switch off, I kept watching because of Fincher, expecting something might happen. I don't mean action, or some twist, or even a proper ending. Just something other than complete cliche. A bit of juvenile philosophical rambling. Dislikeable characters. No tension. No drama. A bit of dominatrix titillation at the start, with, predictably, the sexual woman being the one who ends up dead. Do we need another movie about a psychopathic, emotionless hitman?

The_Killer,"I'm a huge fan of David Fincher's work. I consider Zodiac, The Social Network, & Fight Club to be amongst my favorite films, and Mindhunter in that same category for TV shows. So, even with The Killer dropping on Netflix, I went to a special theater showing to see it on the big screen. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a way in to this one--mainly because plot-lovers (like me) will largely be a bit lost.For a very basic overview, ""The Killer"" tells the story of the unnamed Killer (Michael Fassbender) hired to perform a rather tedious assassination. When the plan goes a bit awry, however, he must compromise--or at least re-evaluate--some of his principles as he ventures into uncharted emotional territory.The Killer is certainly a clinic in cinematography and choreography, as is the usual Fincher style. Its action set pieces are tension-filled and Fassbender's flat aesthetic is perfect for the lead role. Half the film's dialogue is the Killer's snarky inner monologue, and again Fassbender nails that.The big problem--at least for plot-lovers--here is that there is seemingly very little context or rhyme/reason for what we see transpire. Almost nothing is provided other than what is literally playing out in front of viewers in any given scene. As such, I really struggled to care about anything that was happening--in large part because it quite frankly felt like a series of disconnected interludes as opposed to a whole, coherent story. There were times I even felt bored watching because I knew an extended espionage scene was upcoming and I didn't fully understand the stakes.Seeing as how The Killer is getting relatively high marks, I can assume either one of two things is happening: 1. Audiences are not as hung-up on the lack of discernible plot/motives than I; or 2. There is a deeper message here that I'm just utterly missing. Perhaps the ongoing monologue holds the key--but again, I found that more snarky/sardonic than informative.Perhaps more analysis or a second viewing will crystalize The Killer for me--but as it stands in the immediate aftermath of my first viewing I have to place it near (perhaps at) the bottom of the Fincher canon.","'m huge fan David Fincher 's work . consider Zodiac , Social Network , & Fight Club amongst favorite films , Mindhunter category TV shows . , even Killer dropping Netflix , went special theater showing see big screen .

The_Killer,""" Stick to the plan. Anticipate, don't improvise. Trust no one. Yield no advantage. Forbid empathy."" The Killer Michael FassbenderYou've seen cool killers in film before, but maybe not like this one. David Fincher is a fearless director tackling challenging films from Se7en and Gone Girl to Mank and many different subjects in between. The Killer is different from other films about assassins but the same in many respects. His Killer has the cool of Keanua Reeves' John Wick, the ingenuity of Sean Connery's James Bond, and not even close to the warmth of Denzel Washington's Equalizer.Above all he's chill; the introductory quote gives the idea that he is as close to a killing machine as has ever appeared on screen. Reeves looks downright humane by contrast. Yet, like Wick, he is impelled to revenge as he tracks down his employer and operatives, who include Tilda Swinton's Expert at her androgynous, ambiguous best. We never learn his real name, but his aliases are legion, connecting him to us in macabre impersonation of our primal urge to revenge. He use names like Thomas Jefferson, Archie Bunker, and Felix Unger, all from TV and history.To see him order some of his tools from the Amazon Smartphone App is to send an extra chill of recognition and connection. To hear him lament he can't recall his last ""nice quiet drowning"" is to paint a portrait of an amoral ghoul. However, the film is replete with dark jokes like The Expert's bear joke or the parmesan grater.Avenging his girlfriend's beating, Killer tracks down each of her attackers with a precision that the voiceover analysis of his work manifests. Mostly it's about sticking to the plan, not being distracted, and not giving into sympathies. His chat track is late night show amusing but without back story or emotion.He has broken a cardinal rule of his profession by revenging his girlfriend's misfortune. While he exclaims to be indifferent and cold to emotions, his voice over continues to assert the revenge
necessity. In that way, writer Andrew Kevin Walker connects us to emotional weaknesses in us all. After all, his hat and his problems are not much different from Brad Pitt's in Bullet Train.What we do see is a man who is regimented and cool enough to kill for a profession and love and defend a woman who has brought him close to death. In this way, he adds dimension to an MO almost solely owned by John Wick, without the body count. As Total Film's Jan Crowther comments, ""And if you ever wondered what Fincher's Bond might have looked like, this could be it.""The Killer is a hypnotizing study of lethal precision with only a hint of humanity. If you wait for it on Netflix, you can savor the director's precise use of his own cinematic tools as many times as you want. And with intermittent snacks.""I am who I am."" Popeye, quoted by the Killer.","`` Stick plan . Anticipate , n't improvise . Trust one . Yield advantage . Forbid empathy .

The cinematography is fine but the story is very poor and sometimes slow paced.The actions you see coming miles away and it began really weak for a wannabe killer.I cannot explain myself how director David Fincher could accept this disappointing script.Nonetheless I am happy I didn't spent one cent for this sleeper cause I watched it on Netflix.The main role that delivered the killer couldn't present his own qualities of actor. There weren't many dialogues. Instead he was narrating during all the running time of this movie.So be warned.

I see awards on the horizon: for Most Obtrusive Soundtrack and Worst Blatant Product Placement @ the Tip of a Catastrophe!I'm a fan of the 10 minute test for unknown quantity films. Given Amanda's (Juliet Roberts) grating, stage-y opening monologue, I very nearly abandoned this one at the 3:20 mark. Oh, to have a redo on that call! At least wait for Mahershala Ali, I told myself. He has second billing! Don't do it, people; don't wait for Mahershali Ali (GH). Of course he's good. But he's no saving grace here, because there is no grace. The good news is, he enters about 20 minutes in-the very bad news is there's still two hours left of this pointless poop. Denzel got out apparently; why oh why didn't I.I almost fled again, minutes later, right after a huge decision was made. Because the film lost all credibility for me then. That's the moment.Something unexplained, but clearly foreshadowing terrible things, had just occurred that was obviously tied to this person's request, yet: Two grown adults both failed to make that connection; second, their choice is entirely at odds with the power dynamic and proclivities of the people involved; and lastly, the new character is so pointedly telling a whopping lie it's inconceivable anyone would let it slide. Let alone anxious people perched at the edge of a crisis. But nooo, I had to stick around to see if Mahershala Ali (damn you!) was as mysterious as he seemed. Ha!After overstaying, among other things, I found myself wondering what the chances were, genetically, that a brown-eyed mother could give birth to only blue-eyed children (hint: not good), and the height of flamingoes. Let's just say the plot allows ample time to pursue your thoughts.Is the film trying to make a point about the dumbed-down, cynical, phone-addicted, helpless nature of Americans?

That's the main probelm here - there is no payoff, you just keep hoping it'll take off but it never does!There are zero twists or 'wow' moments that the script is literally crying out for and it all becomes way too talky, non-sensical and downright boring. In fact by journeys end the movie descends into cringe/laugh-out=loud territory, while the ending is a total cop out that just makes you shake your head in disbelief and disdain.What should've been something more akin to a top Stephen King/M Night Shyamalan effort is nothing more than a throwaway episodic mess you could watch and instantly forget on Hulu or Peacock.

Leave_the_World_Behind,"Was counting the days to watch this,unfortunately the previews made it seem better than it was.This movie.. Stunk or was lost on potential which never was fulfilled,unless plotholes & clichés count?Did anyone feel the opening soundtrack didn't work for this movie,the rest which followed was unforgettable too..
Nothing against any artists involved,but felt wasn't a good movie fit.Think if Kevin Bacon would of had more than a cameo it,well still would of sucked yet casting would of improved.You didn't really care for any of the characters-If they live or die,you just want answers & a conclusion..
Sadly don't get much of what feels like a satisfying ending,unless you're happy Rose finally seen the Friends tv series finale.With that said..
Honestly if the series Friends wasn't out for years,it would seem like an advertisement for it premiering soon..lol.Seen this movie had satire used as a description feel that gets used as an excuse to cover-up junk!Thinking any praises to good ratings must be from those,involved in this production as it wasn't artsy or a thought provoking masterpiece.You watch movies to get entertained so leaving things opened or for interpretation,actually insults the viewer experience..
Hoping for another movie that digs deeper into things,but feel this won't happen.This movie is basically boring and drags it could of been shorter,to deal with useless nonsense throughout.Felt for a while the were playing the story scenario about race-Especially with Ruth,bottom line the direction was bad in getting points across.I like Julia in movies but she had me hating her character,now for Ethan..
As mentioned above could of been done better with more Kevin,Ethan seemed like a man-child under the circumstances.Also.. Julia goes from a people hater to dance queen(cough)to almost being inappropriate with a person(G. H.)she cared less about. It was one of many awkward scenes,between the characters interacting.The teeth part was gross,but not even scary.. Oh sure Kevin(Danny)gives an explanation as to perhaps why,even though it was also mentioned about a bug bite prior.. Do we care anymore? Was just waiting for the son to become a zombie,at least although clichéd would of been-Something!Yes it does reveal what went on(when Rose finds the bunker)so we get some answers but,where many feel upset is the odd & perhaps abrupt ending..
So you wonder does the son get sicker,do they survive & will things finally be normal again.Rose also told a story about a man,signs & meeting God..
It was insightful think overall the movie wasn't cohesive in parts or direction,otherwise it would of just felt more complete as credits rolled.Also when certain parts did show promise in suspense & so forth,it was cut short or basically ruined..
Such an example was the ominous deer scenes,if something is repeatedly shown than do better with it. Why are they acting strange to hurt any human,due to sickness & need help or what?Anyway.. Want a disaster type movie,skip this & watch anything else.There's a part of me that feels this movie was a human study on what we think or feel,if such an event happened without full resolve & with that said..
If the O's felt strong enough to be listed as executive producers do we need to be concerned,event foreshadowing perhaps -vs- just bad movie taste?Edit-
Did anyone see not long after this movie premiered that Tesla issues massive recall,of more than 2 million vehicles over autopilot safety concerns.. Again,foreshadowing?

Leave_the_World_Behind,"""Leave the World Behind"" starts off strong, weaving an intriguing narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film boasts impressive cinematography, a compelling cast, and an atmosphere that grips the audience from the opening scenes.Regrettably, the movie's potential takes a nosedive when it comes to a screeching halt without warning or resolution. The abrupt ending leaves viewers perplexed and dissatisfied, as if the filmmakers decided to abandon the story midway through. The title ironically echoes the sentiments of the audience, as they are left stranded in a narrative limbo, yearning for closure.While the initial build-up showcases the film's promise, the incomplete nature of ""Leave the World Behind"" is a disservice to its otherwise commendable qualities. A movie that could have easily earned an 8/10 is instead burdened with a 4/10 rating due to the frustration and disappointment induced by its unfinished state.

The haunting score also keeps you on edge as you join the characters in trying to figure out what is happening. A number of reviewers claim the ending is a fail. I disagree.

Leave_the_World_Behind,"""Leave the World Behind"" starts off strong, weaving an intriguing narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. The film boasts impressive cinematography, a compelling cast, and an atmosphere that grips the audience from the opening scenes.Regrettably, the movie's potential takes a nosedive when it comes to a screeching halt without warning or resolution. The abrupt ending leaves viewers perplexed and dissatisfied, as if the filmmakers decided to abandon the story midway through. The title ironically echoes the sentiments of the audience, as they are left stranded in a narrative limbo, yearning for closure.While the initial build-up showcases the film's promise, the incomplete nature of ""Leave the World Behind"" is a disservice to its otherwise commendable qualities. A movie that could have easily earned an 8/10 is instead burdened with a 4/10 rating due to the frustration and disappointment induced by its unfinished state. This cinematic experience is a clear case of a captivating story left untold, leaving audiences behind in a state of narrative abandonment.","`` Leave World Behind '' starts strong , weaving intriguing narrative keeps viewers edge seats . film boasts impressive cinematography , compelling cast , atmosphere grips audience opening scenes.Regrettably , movie 's potential takes nosedive comes screeching halt without warning resolution . abrupt ending leaves viewers perplexed dissatisfied , filmmakers decided abandon story midway . title ironically echoes sentiments audience , left stranded narrative limbo , yearning closure.While initial build-up showcases film 's promise , incomplete nature `` Leave World Behind '' disservice otherwise commendable qualities . movie could easily earned 8/10 instead burdened 4/10 rating due frustration disappointment induced unfinished state . cinematic experience clear case captivating story left untold , leaving audiences behind state narrative abandonment .","`` leav world behind '' start strong , weav intrigu narr keep viewer edg seat . film boast impress cinematographi , compel cast , atmospher grip audienc open scenes.regrett , movi 's potenti take nosed come screech halt without warn resolut . abrupt end leav viewer perplex dissatisfi , filmmak decid abandon stori midway . titl iron echo sentiment audienc , left strand narr limbo , yearn closure.whil initi build-up showcas film 's promis , incomplet natur `` leav world behind '' disservic otherwis commend qualiti . movi could easili earn 8/10 instead burden 4/10 rate due frustrat disappoint induc unfinish state . cinemat experi clear case captiv stori left untold , leav audienc behind state narr abandon .",bad,negative,-0.521
Leave_the_World_Behind,"This film has an A-list cast, thought-provoking premise and is a good flick. Leave the World Behind.makes you think and requires attention to detail. If you are a person who doesn't like either, then this film is not for you. Julia Roberts, playing a full-on Karen, is a married mom of two. She and her rather- passive husband, played by Ethan Hawke, are renting a home outside New York for the weekend. Soon after arriving, they lose their internet connection, their phones die and the TV stops working. Soon the owner of the rental and his daughter, (played by Mahershala Ali and Myha'la, knock at their door in the middle of the night and request to stay overnight .in their house with the renters due to a blackout in the city. From there, the story unfolds slowly building on a number of strange and apocalyptic occurrences and how these two families of strangers bridge initial feelings of mistrust, overcome prejudices and bond to try to figure out what is happening and how to survive. Tho actors play off each other very well. Shout out to Kevin Bacon for always making his mark, no matter how big or small the role. The haunting score also keeps you on edge as you join the characters in trying to figure out what is happening. A number of reviewers claim the ending is a fail. I disagree. If you don't get it, then you probably weren't paying close enough attention.

The ending tried to wrap up the movie way too fast and left a lot of unanswered questions that alluded to a number of suspenseful/sci-fi plot points that never came to fruition.In the end, the entire plot was that the US was under attack by one, or potentially several hostile threats/countries, but that is never clarified. Ok, but what about the random plot points that went no where?Cyber attack, sure that makes sense. Auto pilot cars that intentionally clog up major motor ways, that makes sense. Navigation systems disrupting freight ships and airplanes, that makes sense. But it falls apart from there.The noise was part of the attack but we never find out what exactly it was, what was generating it, what the extent of the damage it was causing, but let's not get into that aside from it's most likely just part of a shock and awe campaign.The deer and flamingos congregating on the property is just simply explained as ""The animals know something we don't"" but let's just leave it at that and not go into any more detail or explain any of it.There's a random shed that looks at the house, and there's a bed of leaves with a body indentation where someone has been sleeping. Super creepy, is this another character that has been stalking the families? Nope, it's never explained and doesn't factor into the plot at all.The son gets bit by an insect and his teeth start falling out the next day. Is there a plague that will wipe out civilization? Nope, they just get some random pills from a handyman and that's the end of that plot line.Is mom dead? Probably, but let's not get into that, instead let's just have a super awkward scene where a drunk husband and wife come close to cheating on their spouses.There's a shot of the US flag on the moon with the earth in the background, is there an alien invasion? Nope, we just threw that scene in there because why not? It might loosely represent that the US is under attack but otherwise we just really wanted this scene in the movie for no reason.So much wasted potential.

Leave_the_World_Behind,"A middle class couple leave NYC with their two teenage kids to stay in a luxurious Long Island beach house for a weekend getaway. Phone, TV and internet stop functioning shortly after their arrival, and when the family try to relax by the ocean a huge oil tanker inexplicably runs itself aground on the beach. Late that night the home's affluent African-American owner and his college-age daughter arrive seeking refuge from societal disintegration in Manhattan, and a prickly introduction follows before the ill-matched group falls asleep uneasily under the same roof.Morning brings a truce, but no illumination about the nature of the crisis. The vacationers stay on as numerous disturbing incidents demonstrate all is not well with the world - airliners crash out of clear blue skies, wrecked cars block the highways, animals behave strangely, loud noises blare and the teenage son falls ill. Theories are proposed that the mayhem might be caused by hostile foreigners or native extremists, but nothing is certain, and the story never develops much of an arc.The cast manages to keep the project afloat until all the bizarre happenings start undermining credulity. The various disasters have little rationality behind them, and the absence of other human beings within sight of the city seems implausible. Once belief has been lost, the movie shows how a suspenseful mystery about world-changing events can turn into a bit of a bore. As the film sputters out of existence, it feels like it might have been conceived as a pilot for a TV series. The deeply unsatisfying conclusion leaves the impression that the writers were as clueless as their characters about the catastrophe which they'd invented.","middle class couple leave NYC two teenage kids stay luxurious Long Island beach house weekend getaway .

Leave_the_World_Behind,"It seems as if a lot of people were disappointed by this movie. For some reason it hasn't been officially labeled as science fiction but I would put it squarely in the category of science fiction that is thought-provoking and has points to make - which can mean, frustratingly, that it's meant to operate on a metaphorical level as against being intended to be taken literally - I put the brilliant ""Severance"" in this category too. In addition to being thought-provoking, it is, fortunately, also quite riveting, eerie, and exceptionally well-cast and well-acted. I wanted to single out Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali, but it would be unfair to leave out the rest of the cast. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER - As far as messages, the obvious one is over-dependency on tech; but the overarching theme is that we don't need aliens to destroy us, it is easy to get us to tear ourselves apart from within; all the seeds are there. It therefore has an all-too-relevant contemporary political message, yet its implications about current politics are indirect, not ham-fisted. I will also mention that once I perceived this message I thought of an episode of the original Twilight Zone that had a similar theme, starring Claude Akins, in which disguised aliens from another planet work up residents of a small town into more or less lynching each other. Anyway, back to Leave the World Behind - some viewers have indicated disapproval of SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER its lack of specific information as to who has launched the attack, how the various individuals fare in the end, etc. But IMO it ends where it needs to - the points have been made, and the viewer can imagine his or her own scenarios.","seems lot people disappointed movie . reason n't officially labeled science fiction would put squarely category science fiction thought-provoking points make - mean , frustratingly , 's meant operate metaphorical level intended taken literally - put brilliant `` Severance '' category . addition thought-provoking , , fortunately , also quite riveting , eerie , exceptionally well-cast well-acted . wanted single Julia Roberts Mahershala Ali , would unfair leave rest cast .

Leave_the_World_Behind,"""Leave the World Behind"" garnered significant attention in 2023, particularly for being recognized as the year's best film by The Wrap. However, after viewing this film, I must vehemently disagree with this accolade.The film attempts to present a sort of fear-mongering narrative, where a single cyberattack cripples the entire infrastructure of the United States, including satellites, atomic weapon security systems, airplanes, and large cargo ships. This concept is not only exaggerated but ridiculously unrealistic.What the film lacks is a coherent story. The plot feels unfinished, with characters who have no depth. The film seems more intent on serving as a warning about what could happen amidst tense international relations, but it does so in such an unbelievable and theatrical manner that it completely misses its mark.The length of the movie, 2 hours and 20 minutes, felt like an endless quest for logical answers, which, unfortunately, never came. The plot holes were numerous and laughable, such as a ship crashing onto a beach because the GPS fails, as if there would be no crew on board to steer the ship.Instead of delivering a powerful message or an engaging story, ""Leave the World Behind"" offers nothing more than a series of confusing and unrealistic scenarios. It's a shame that a film with such potential is reduced to nothing more than a cheap scare story.Feel free to further modify this review to match your style or to add any additional points you find important.","`` Leave World Behind '' garnered significant attention 2023 , particularly recognized year 's best film Wrap .

As the film progresses, both the dialogue and acting make you feel increasingly uncomfortable, and not in a ""good,"" and suspenseful way. Which then leads me onto the background music which is as increasingly irritating as the acting and script, to the point where I wondered if the movie would be improved if I muted the sound. It's unsettling mood would be fine if it was used appropriately, but it's almost as if the director decided to just let it play on a loop throughout the entire film.

But the little girl is happy because she has found what matters the most to her in the bunker and she is safe.Such an event would not only occur if a hidden enemy caused these things to happen. It is not even clear whether that was the cause in the case of the film. These things can also be caused by cosmic rays, geomagnetic storms and solar flares, which occur regularly.

The last known event that had a significant impact was the Carrington event in 1859.The consequences of such an event would be far more threatening today than in 1859. It would throw us back to the Stone Age. Such geomagnetic storms destroy electronic circuits, semiconductors etc. This was not an issue back then since these haven't been invented yet.

When you make an apocalyptic movie you need to make at least one likable character. Half way in I couldn't care less if all of them vanished. You have Julia Robert's (a generally likable actress in most films) angry, complaining about everything , being the definitive 'Karen' for most of the movie, Ethan Hawk who acts like the biggest (another word for cat) the entire movie, their 2 kids one stupider then the other, Myha'la Jael Herrold the stereotypical affluent young black PC girl who blames everything on the white people, Kevin Bacon who is in it for a minute (wasted talent)playing a stereotypical right wing prepper, and the only remotely likable character played by Ali.This movie played into every stereotype ad nauseum! No character had common sense.So with all that you get a long movie that has no real backstory and no real plausible story in general. Things happen and you can guess what is occurring but the characters make the dumbest decisions to the point you're thinking 'what is wrong with these people?"".Then the daughter with this whole obsession with the show Friends! Really!? She's old enough to know that the world may end yet her main focus is catching the last episode of Friends?You've failed as a parent if that is the only thing your teen kid cares about (this theme runs throughout the movie). I'm sure there was a deeper meaning to the Friends theme, they just forgot to tell the audience.This is a stellar cast so I would expect something more.. maybe this is a product of 'Too many cooks spoil the soup' ... look at how many high profile people produced this.Maybe it would've made a better mini series so each person could put their ideas in a separate take.Missed opportunity big time!","want start saying generally love apocalyptic movies.However ... make apocalyptic movie need make least one likable character .

Animal,"Technically, there was no cohesive storyline. Dialogues were all over the place. Conversations between characters were weird. Like every time one would say something and other would go into an unrelated monologue. (Mostly ranbir).It's nothing like the trailer. Story is not about son and father.

Even if you make a negative character, his actions need to be consistent. In one instant they want to show he is unhinged and doesn't care, and then next instant he would forgive and protect them.A movie needs to have a story, a plot, characters need to make sense inside the movie.Their attempt at jokes were so distasteful. He gives a wedgie to a servant, rants about his underwear, there's two monologues about pubic hair, there's denial about medicine.Even the climax was so underwhelming.

Animal,"For the starters I would say that you may love this movie or hate it, but you just can't ignore it in any caseFilm can be divided into four aspects - A) STORYLINE, B) ACTING, C) DIRECTION, and most importantly D) ACTION or VIOLENCE or simply BLOODSHED. Now below are my brief opinions on each of these aspects -A) STORYLINE - it is quite simple and mostly linear with few twists and turns. New is the father son bond that had long not been seen in any cinema. In this movie Mufasa and Simba get separated, but not for long, and what follows their union is mad mad love and madness around it.B) ACTING - acting by the cast makes this simple story very interesting and keeps you engaged for the entire runtime of the movie that is whopping three hours and 23 minutes plus few minutes of post credit scene which you can't simply miss and will leave you in awe. This role has evolved the actor in Ranbir as this one is no romantic and sweet Ranbir one is used to, this one's possessive, angry, masculine, and also, toxic. And he has played his role with absolute finesse. You get to see Rashmika's evolution too, which in latter half will leave you stunned. She has done a great job and looked pretty enough. Rest no one's average, and played their part well. Oh yeah Bobby's in here too, won't say much about him though, let it be a surprise and see it for yourself.C) DIRECTION - Sir, Sandeep Vanga Reddy had been quite upset or probably angry over the criticism his previous movie received, even though it became a box office success. However, this time he learnt the lesson well and guess what, he has responded back to the critics with a film that is even more toxic, masculine, violent and massy than his previous work beyond criticism. His direction is amazing. He has a knack for getting you engrossed from the beginning to the very end with his style of filmmaking that you start believing that you're a part of the events unfolding frame by frame and while sitting in the theatre through astral projection you've been transported into the screen and witness things right before your eyes and around you.D) ACTION/VIOLENCE/BLOODSHED - I've been fan of action and macabre stuff whether in movies or TV shows. But the bloodbath and violence that is present in this movie is unimaginable and unmatchable. This movie has for me taken everything to new bloody heights and raised the bloodied bar high enough. Before interval and nearing to climax and further it's a total RED ALERT. You may need a vomiting bag by the end. Anyway all in all violence is something that you may not like but believe me when it is not on the screen in this movie you will keep eagerly waiting for the blood to flow, muscles to collide, cuss words to be hurled at one another and sharp objects and bullets to cut and penetrate through the fleshes. It will keep the Dracula in you satiated for days.BLOODY GO FOR THIS MENACE CINEMA ASAP !!!

Animal,"If you squint, you can kind of see where Sandeep Venga's Animal is supposed to go. It's a character study about an unhinged man born into privilege but lacking in the most important qualities, obsessed with his father who never showed him the love he needed. He's drawn into a world of violence and crime, in a desperate attempt to impress him. That's an interesting concept; throw in some of the Successionesque business politics, and you could've had an incredible film. The movie certainly has the talented names - Ranbir Kapoor, Anil Kappor, Bobby Deol - to make it work.Yet, Animal fails on basically every level. It feels like the creation of an annoying 14 year old Indian boy than a film, and can only be described as TOO MUCH. This 3 hour and 24 minutes feels like an eternity as we zip from scene to scene, moment to moment, without much time to breathe. Not to mention, the film just feels excessive and it's not entertaining. It's honestly an exhausting affair.TOO MUCH brutality and gore. It's completely unnecessary, off putting, and difficult to watch. We're supposed to like our protagonist (more on him later), yet he's needlessly cruel and violent, like everyone at a certain point in this film. It feels really ""off"" tonally, and comes out of nowhere. The scene where Bobby Deol was introduced started off nicely, but then goes off the rails with the blood and gore, and it ruins it completely. Not to mention the unnecessary...sex scene. Yeah. More on THIS later too.Ranbir Kapoor's Vijay is a psychopath, who is as mentioned before, cruel and violent, but unstable, rude, callous, condescending, misogynistic, and difficult to empathize with. We have to spend a bulk of the film with this man, and the movie is constantly asking us to sympathize and respect him, but he deserves none of it. I like films with ""unlikable"" protagonists, but a film has to give us a reason to connect with them from time to time. I don't want to hear anyone complain about Leo's Jordan Belfort ever again; a guy we know is terrible, but you can't help but like him. Vijay is not that.The film is supposed to be about who is trying to kill Anil Kapoor's Papa (that's not his real name, but it might as well be, and to be fair, he's really good in this), and lead us into some corporate and maybe political intrigue. But the film wastes it with a paper thin, poorly told plot and villain's whose performers give it their all and are compelling via performance, but definitely terribly written. They're two dimensional and their motives feel rushed, and not to mention, the film can't help but be a bit Islamophobic as well. (There's subtext to these Modi era Bollywood movies).But frankly, the worst thing about this movie is its celebration of toxic masculinity and misogyny. I'm no Bechdel Test wielding feminist, but my God, this movie really hates women. They're either doeish sex objects or lack any agency at all. There's a really dark and twisted attitude towards sex and relationships this movie portrays, glorifying domination, fear, and abuse, all whilst desperately trying to convince us the main couple have a happy and successful marriage. Vijay can't help but undermine and demean every other woman he sees, treating them as sexual objects, intimidating them, or insulting them. And what's disturbing is the movie seems to want to paint him as ""the man men want to be, and the man women want to date.""There's legitimately a stretch of this film towards the end where I genuinely worried we'd see explicit violence against women, like some wife slapping or choking or worse, SA or the R word. I'm not joking. I saw this with three women. You can imagine how they felt.Yeah, I'd maybe watch this high and laugh at with friends again, but for anyone else, PLEASE avoid this trashfire.","squint , kind see Sandeep Venga 's Animal supposed go .

After the first few scenes, they didn't reveal anything more about their connection.Regarding content, Ranvijay was never able to provide a clear response to a query.

I still am trying my best to figure out what this movie wish to inspire the viewers? I cant understand what this movie was made of. Yes it had some good acting by Lord Bobby and Ranbir but no where this movie is acceptable where all are insulting each other and Ranbir to get the truth of his enemy slept with another girl and just moved on with his wife like nothing happened.No cops or nothing to investigate so many murders. This movie have nothing new to be honest and don't know why a few are saying its the benchmark of Indian movie where according to me the benchmark were Lagaan and Swadesh.This movie only focused on Ranbir Kapoor but very few scenes of Lord Bobby and others as if they were completely non existent.,Directors taking indian citizens granted .

Animal,"First of all
There wasn't a story over all
Action action and action
As we all informed that this film is chemistry between father and son
There wasn't such a thing in the movie
In his childhood he took the gun and went to the school
What a message to the society that if some ragging happens take gun and go to school
Then on his comeback vijay argued with brother in law without specific reason
Turned a girl calling her brother into wife
Then had a intimate scene in air
This director so imaginative
He can imagine any thing
Then suddenly balbir singh got attacked and shot by two bullets but he was safe
Why his brother in law was against balbir still a mystery
He took guns and goons in a meeting killing his own brother in law
And later on taking 300 people in hotel with gun machine
His all goons are safe and he was on verge of death
Every thing finished with him he was in coma come out of it with all damage parts but he was ok
Specially his physical abilities to have SE** was finished
(Later director forget this point and he had Se* with zoya)
Suddenly bobby deol appears only to die
Bobby deol cant speak and ranbir cant talk like 5Th standard student making story
Why bobby deol grand father kicked from company still mystery and then turned into muslim family
Sikh turned into muslim family what a joke what a joke
This is insult to sikh brothers
Sikh always proud of there religion and this funny director insulted them
Then suddenly vijay walk naked in his home front of his father and mother what a shameful sceneI recommend to ban this kind of movie

Animal,"Vijay (Ranbir Singh) is obsessed with his father Balbir Singh (Anil Kapoor), going to any extent to win his approval. Other than being extremely obsessed, Vijay is also an alpha male. The privilege he is born with, makes him be all the things he perceives to be the qualities of an alpha male. He goes conquering every he lays his eyes on except his father's approval. When Balbir Singh is attacked, Vijay comes back seeking vengeance and all hell breaks loose. Who attacked Balbir? What is their connection with Balbir's family? Will Vijay ever get tired of devouring his demons, forms rest of the story.Sandeep Reddy Vanga got triggered a lot due to the harsh criticism he received for Kabir Singh from a small section of critics and vowed to make the most violent film, which he succeeds. He didn't say anything about making a good film and that reflects in the second half. For what it's worth, the 1hr 45mins long first half was indeed terrific and Ranbir Kapoor is presented in never seen before avatar (not just Ranbir but any Bollywood hero in general). The non-linear narrative helps and so does the excessive violence. Everything Vanga has cooked up in the first half worked superbly.The second half is where the film stumbled big time as the weak script and barring Ranbir's Vijay, every other character being underwritten, badly pulls down the film. Excessive of everything will become unbearable and that is exactly what happens in the second half. Atleast the first half had hero elevations and gave him a purpose to help connect with the character. But in the second half, the writing undoes everything turning Vijay into this massive jerk than an animal and it is only Ranbir's performance that tries to be the film's savior.Speaking of underwritten roles, it is exactly here where Sandeep Reddy Vanga fails. Everything strictly remains on the surface level, be it the father-son relationship or husband-wife. We are told the reason for the enmity between Balbir's family and that of Abrar Haque (Bobby Deol) but it is never effectively established what their backstory was. It simply settles to bunch of wild nasty men going at each other with unnecessary amount of violence. Even Tripti Dimri's Zoya is so poorly written, the character's action at the crucial point made no sense whatsoever.Coming back to Vijay and Geetanjali's (Rashmika) relationship, it is somewhat an extended version of Arjun-Preeti / Kabir-Preeti though Geetanjali gets to take charge of couple of situations, only to give in. Just having the couple talk about their sex life openly or even fight using sex in the argument alone isn't enough to sell their love story. Anil Kapoor's Balbir sadly gets sidelined in the second half, only to get a proper scene in the end. All of this is what makes the entire second half feel so empty. But, the post credit scene was indeed very good.Overall, Ranbir Kapoor's terrific performance definitely deserved a better second half. I am going with a lenient rating just for that first half, Ranbir Kapoor and the post credit scene.","Vijay ( Ranbir Singh ) obsessed father Balbir Singh ( Anil Kapoor ) , going extent win approval . extremely obsessed , Vijay also alpha male . privilege born , makes things perceives qualities alpha male . goes conquering every lays eyes except father 's approval .

While some elements may flirt with the border of realism, their allure remains undeniable.

Yet, her artistry, mirroring her look, face, and voice, ventures into an unintended realm of vexation.Cinematography excels in many scenes but falters in a few. The VFX is also inconsistent, with some shots lacking quality.Locations, sets, props, costumes, makeup - each thread in this visual tapestry is finely woven, except for a few missteps.Songs take the audience on a melodic journey, swaying between highs and lows, while the backdrop symphony stands as a testament to musical prowess.However, editing poses an issue, as the second half is excessively lengthy and occasionally boring.In the directorial realm, Sandeep Reddy Vanga crafts a potent odyssey.

Animal,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of watching a movie that was not only an abomination in terms of storytelling but also an exercise in excessive runtimes. The film in question was a seemingly endless marathon of nonsensical scenes, pointless dialogue, and a plot that could only be described as an insult to the art of storytelling.First and foremost, the story was so poorly constructed that it left me wondering if the writers had forgotten the basic principles of narrative coherence. The plot meandered aimlessly, lurching from one incoherent subplot to another, with no apparent connection or relevance to the overall story. Characters popped in and out of scenes with no clear motivation or purpose, leaving me perplexed and utterly disengaged from their fates.Furthermore, the individual scenes seemed to serve no function other than to waste precious minutes of my life. I struggled to find any semblance of meaning or significance in the endless stream of dialogue and action. At times, it felt as though the filmmakers were simply throwing ideas at the wall in the hope that something would stick, but alas, nothing did.To add insult to injury, the movie clocked in at an excruciating three-plus hours. Three hours of my life that I will never get back. I found myself checking the time, hoping against hope that the end was nigh, only to discover that I still had another hour of agony to endure. It was a cruel and unusual punishment, and I can only assume that the filmmakers were determined to test the limits of human endurance.The Climax Was So Bad With Silly Fight Scenes With No Point At All.

Animal,"When did violence in films become a yardstick for assessing a movie's quality? I'm perplexed by the way violence is marketed like a potent drug in films, triggering a dopamine rush that fosters a craving for more.

Ranbir Kapoor's latest film, Animal, has roared into theaters, promising a thrilling and action-packed ride. Unfortunately, the film delivers little more than gratuitous violence, misogynistic themes, and an unoriginal storyline. Animal is a disappointment on almost every level, leaving viewers feeling numb and disillusioned rather than entertained.An Unforgivable Level of Violence:The film's most glaring flaw is its excessive and unnecessary violence. From brutal beatings to gruesome murders, Animal revels in bloodshed, leaving viewers feeling desensitized and disgusted. The violence feels gratuitous and exploitative, adding nothing to the story and serving only to shock and titillate.Misogyny Masquerading as Entertainment:Animal paints a deeply disturbing portrait of women, portraying them as objects to be possessed and controlled. The film's female characters are devoid of depth or agency, existing solely to serve the male protagonist's desires. This blatant misogyny is deeply offensive and undermines any attempt to enjoy the film.A Story That Lacks Originality:The film's plot follows a tired and predictable formula, offering nothing new or surprising to viewers. The characters are predictable archetypes, and the story unfolds in a way that feels derivative and uninspired. Animal feels like a reheated version of countless other gangster films, offering no reason to invest in its characters or their journey.A Waste of Talent:Ranbir Kapoor delivers a forgettable performance as the film's lead protagonist. He is unable to imbue his character with any depth or charisma, leaving the audience feeling indifferent to his fate. The supporting cast is equally disappointing, with none of the actors able to rise above the film's weak material.A missed opportunity:Animal had the potential to be a compelling and thought-provoking film. Unfortunately, the filmmakers opted for a cheap and sensational approach, sacrificing substance for shock value. The result is a film that is both morally repugnant and intellectually bankrupt.Here are some of the specific criticisms of the film:Gratuitous and unnecessary violence.Deeply offensive and misogynistic themes.Unoriginal plot and predictable characters.Forgettable performances from the cast.A complete lack of substance or meaning.Overall, Animal is a deeply disappointing film that squanders its potential. It is a gruesome spectacle that is devoid of any real entertainment value or artistic merit. If you are looking for a film that will challenge you and leave you thinking, I urge you to avoid Animal altogether.Rating: 1 out of 5 stars.","Basically Kabhie Khushi kabhi gaam Drugs.Animal : Gruesome Spectacle Devoid Substance Ranbir Kapoor 's latest film , Animal , roared theaters , promising thrilling action-packed ride .

Animal,"""Animal"" unfolds as a misguided cinematic endeavor, raising red flags for its portrayal of a central character steeped in possessiveness. The narrative traces back to the protagonist's school days, depicting him as the self-appointed heir to the family throne after an evidently neglectful father. This skewed sense of responsibility leads him to make decisions for others, showcasing a troubling dynamic.The film takes a regrettable turn by treating the central character's wife as an object and projecting a palpable disdain towards women. Such regressive depictions can confuse Gen Z viewers, who often prioritize progressive values. The violence depicted in the movie, coupled with the absence of law enforcement despite countless murders, adds a layer of inconsistency that undermines the narrative's credibility.A glaring departure from reality occurs when the protagonist engages in a prolonged, physically demanding fight post-heart surgery, straining the bounds of believability. However, amidst these narrative missteps, the film does salvage some merit through commendable performances. Ranbir Kapoor's commitment to the director's vision shines through, offering a silver lining in an otherwise turbulent storyline.The background music proves to be a standout element, complementing the intense scenes effectively. Unfortunately, the placement of songs during crucial junctures, such as the interval block fight and encounters with the main villain, fails to capture and sustain audience interest. These moments, rather than enhancing the cinematic experience, contribute to a disjointed narrative.In conclusion, while ""Animal"" boasts strong performances and noteworthy musical compositions, these aspects are overshadowed by a problematic storyline. The film's portrayal of possessiveness, mistreatment of women, and an unrealistic portrayal of physical resilience post-surgery undermine its potential. ""Animal"" ultimately falls short of delivering a compelling cinematic experience and, on the whole, is not worth the investment of time and attention.","`` Animal '' unfolds misguided cinematic endeavor , raising red flags portrayal central character steeped possessiveness . narrative traces back protagonist 's school days , depicting self-appointed heir family throne evidently neglectful father . skewed sense responsibility leads make decisions others , showcasing troubling dynamic.The film takes regrettable turn treating central character 's wife object projecting palpable disdain towards women . regressive depictions confuse Gen Z viewers , often prioritize progressive values . violence depicted movie , coupled absence law enforcement despite countless murders , adds layer inconsistency undermines narrative 's credibility.A glaring departure reality occurs protagonist engages prolonged , physically demanding fight post-heart surgery , straining bounds believability .

2 rashmika mandana is just for kissing scenes and to listen ranting of the protagonist
3 portryal of all women is very disturbing
4 no depth in story
5 willing extension of disbelief also very difficult bcz they have chosen a genz timeline but the story is based in millenial timeline

Animal,"Animal, the latest cinematic blunder from director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, is a film that assaults the senses and insults the intellect. The story, if one can call it that, centers on Vijay, a gangster as devoid of depth as he is of conscience. Ranbir Kapoor's portrayal of this abhorrent character is as unsettling as it is uninspired. His performance, lacking any nuance or complexity, reduces Vijay to a mere caricature of toxic masculinity. Animal is a cinematic disaster, a toxic symphony of violence and misogyny. It offers no insights, no entertainment, and no redemption. It is a film that should be avoided at all costs, lest it leave its viewers feeling as empty, jaded, and disturbed as Vanga himself.","Animal , latest cinematic blunder director Sandeep Reddy Vanga , film assaults senses insults intellect . story , one call , centers Vijay , gangster devoid depth conscience .

The second half was over 20 minutes too long I am sure being director and editor he was having a hard time editing it but he really should have that is the only boring part . He will loose a lot of audience on that part but strangely I am recommending all my friends to watch it and after 10nyears it might be the first movie I'll reqat h again in cinema but that would be mainly due to songs and supporting actors . Ranbir is of course above the rim. The director needs to learn to cut scenes which are not needed . But why 10? Coz directors mistake ain't characters mistake.

Animal,The movie has a worst editing and storyline was mediocre. The scenes lost there context and start randomly. The only face saver was Ranbir acting. Even anil Kapoor seems to be overacting.The movie is below average and awfully long. The story could have been told in 2 hours. Some scene s were very long and sitting through them felt like agony. Action was unnecessary and fight sequences seemed like filler sequences. Also action gun fights all seemed like fantasy action..there was no realism. Finally dont go to watch it with your teenage kids. The movie is bad and doesn't deserve your money and time. If you still want to waste your time.

Animal,"Everything is phenomenal about the movie but in a scene, they showed cheating too much that it destroys the logic. The way they showed the romance in the first half the cheating feels really really bad. Although, it was a part of a plan, it could have been minimised. That would have reduced the length. There was a scene where I felt they could have used the song more than dialogues.

Agreed that there are such bad characters in the society but promoting that by making a 10x worse version of it in a movie with famous celebrities is never a good idea.

In his self destructive nature it wasnt only his wife that he lost. I'm the same misogyny that was shown against his wife the exact opposite was shown with his sister in the start of the movie. It is this contrast that builds his self destructive character that would do anything for his father due to the lack of time he had and has at the end of the movie.

There's too much of obsession with son-father bond (kind of is derogative). Chances that people might even get false inspiration from the movie to portray those acts in reality. Likewise, the storyline features degrading personality of the character- innocent little kid to an early adult full of hormonal imbalances (which was great and intriguing) but suddenly to a criminal, killing and subduing counter parts without mediation and dialogues.

The loosely written plotlines and characters severely dilapitated Ranbir's character as well because the other characters were so underdeveloped. Lack of motive in even the central character resulted in a lack of conviction in the whole story to such a level that after taking in so much of grandly choreographed violence, one is left scratching head wondering everything happened for what exactly! Emotion got translated i nto only one sided shouting and the viewer is left alone to experience an exhausting and frantic TV debate show where only the TV anchor gets to shout.Severe formula plotpoints and scenes , some of which are inspired from Godfather,OldBoy(2003), The man from Nowhere (2010) Rajneeti and even Kabir Singh were put together in such a way that one is left doubting whether the director wanted to copy from his own previous success just because it worked earlier. But it didn't result in anything like Kabir Singh because everything was so incoherent. The brilliant opening of the movie, by the director's own obcession of using pointless violence (or might be a desperate attempt to cover up the flaws in storyline) got reduced into one and only point- who can shout the loudest! Or thats what a predatory animal is supposed to do- a non-human who shouldn't be part of humane society but gets occassionally breaded by our society.

Animal,"Animal,"" the latest creation from director Sandeep Reddy Vanga, plunges audiences into a raw and unapologetic exploration of crime and redemption.This 3-hour and 30-minute cinematic journey is not for the faint of heart, boasting intense storytelling, unsettling violence, and a standout performance by Ranbir Kapoor.In the vein of Vanga's previous work in ""Kabir Singh,"" ""Animal"" fearlessly delves into the darker facets of human nature. The narrative is uncompromising, offering a brutal look at the consequences of choices, all set against a backdrop of morally ambiguous characters.Ranbir Kapoor, in a departure from his typical roles, embraces the challenge of portraying a truly unlikable character. Kapoor's brilliance lies in making you despise his character while simultaneously acknowledging the complexity and depth of his portrayal. It's a performance that's off-putting yet undeniably captivating, showcasing Kapoor's versatility as an actor.The film's soundtrack, hauntingly beautiful, adds an eerie layer to the story. It doesn't seek to comfort; instead, it amplifies the discomfort, enhancing the overall sense of unease that permeates the narrative. This bold musical choice pays off, leaving a lasting impression on the viewer.Cinematographer Amit Roy deserves commendation for capturing the raw essence of every moment. The violence, though off-putting for some, is portrayed with an unflinching gaze, adding authenticity to the narrative. Roy's work elevates the visual storytelling, making each frame a powerful and evocative piece of art.Now, addressing the elephant in the room - the unlikable protagonist and the unapologetic violence may not resonate with everyone. ""Animal"" challenges conventional notions of a likable lead, and Kapoor's character is intentionally crafted to be morally ambiguous. If you're looking for a conventional hero, you won't find one here.In conclusion, ""Animal"" is a cinematic plunge into the abyss, unapologetically brutal and anchored by a stellar yet unlikable performance from Ranbir Kapoor. While the violence may be a deterrent for some, and Kapoor's character a tough pill to swallow, for those willing to embrace the darkness, ""Animal"" offers a thought-provoking and unforgettable experience. It's not a film for everyone, but for those seeking cinematic boldness and depth, ""Animal"" delivers in spades.","Animal , '' latest creation director Sandeep Reddy Vanga , plunges audiences raw unapologetic exploration crime redemption.This 3-hour 30-minute cinematic journey faint heart , boasting intense storytelling , unsettling violence , standout performance Ranbir Kapoor.In vein Vanga 's previous work `` Kabir Singh , '' `` Animal '' fearlessly delves darker facets human nature . narrative uncompromising , offering brutal look consequences choices , set backdrop morally ambiguous characters.Ranbir Kapoor , departure typical roles , embraces challenge portraying truly unlikable character .

Spirited,"""Spirited"" is a wretched film. Yes, the starpower is great. I am a huge Will Ferrell fan, Ryan Reynolds fan, Octavia Spencer fan. Patrick Page, who plays Marley, is awesome. It is for the actors that I gave a zero-star film an extra star.The problem is the script and the direction, both of which are disastrous. The movie has no idea where it's going. There's terror then weak jokes then the suicide subplot then the online bullying subplot then a so bad it hurts ""dance"" number in Victorian England with Reynolds' Cockney accent so bad he makes Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins sound like native Cockney speaker Michael Caine.And, look.

Spirited,"Lack of Story
There is no story in this movie, just scenes strung together with easy-to-forget songs. I think the writer thought, after seeing ""La La Land,"" that it would be easy to create a wonderful musical screenplay. Wrong. It's easy to create a terrible musical screenplay.Exposition and More Exposition
Exposition, a movie no-no, is a bullet to any audience's head. Exposition *in a song* is a bullet to any audience's heart. Both styles of exposition appear in this movie, so I guess we're dead and dead again.Unconvincing Characters
This movie's characters don't feel like real people, or even real dead people. They feel like cardboard cut-outs made to say things by the screenwriter.Lack of Action in Non-Song Scenes
If standing around is entertaining to you, you will be entertained by the non-song scenes in this movie.Lack of Imagination in Direction of Scenes
A director needs a fertile imagination to create a good movie. If the action of a scene is unoriginal or uninspiring or unconvincing, the audience's attention drifts. Making a movie is not just filming people speaking words, it's filming the choreography of life in a unique world.Low Production Value
It looks as if every charmless, spiritless scene was shot in one take.Shockingly Bad Production Design
The production design is so awful that I'm sure it's not the Production Designer's fault but the fault of someone forcing the production designer to make horrible choices again and again. In other words, I think the Production Designer did a brilliant job of creating terrible visual landscapes.Shocking Bad Editing
Editing mistakes are offered up to the audience on the silver platter of the silver screen. It's hard to blame the editor, though, as the script is a mind-numbing word-salad. If the editor cuts from one shot where nothing interesting is going on to another shot where nothing interesting is going on, what's the difference?$20,000,000
Ryan Reynolds reportedly received $20 million to appear in this hopeless, dispirited movie. Will Ferrell reportedly received the same salary. Why either of these great actors said yes to this lifeless script is beyond understanding. I'm not even going to insinuate that their decisions were influenced by the formidable salaries offered, as they each could have appeared in a much better movie for the same amount or more.Don't waste your time or money on what is certainly the most boring film in recent years. Don't let your head, or your heart, be the target of exposition, the cardinal sin of screenwriting.Have a wonderful day, and have a heart-warming Christmas.","Lack Story story movie , scenes strung together easy-to-forget songs . think writer thought , seeing `` La La Land , '' would easy create wonderful musical screenplay .

The_Archies,"""The Archies"" hits a sour note from the very start, thanks to a cast that delivers performances ranging from uninspired to downright cringe-worthy. The acting, a fundamental element that could have salvaged the film, instead becomes its biggest flaw.Lead by a once-promising ensemble, the cast of ""The Archies"" appears disengaged, phoning in performances that lack authenticity and emotional depth. Even the usually reliable actors fail to inject life into their characters, reducing them to mere cardboard cutouts of their animated counterparts. The chemistry between the cast members is virtually non-existent, making it difficult for the audience to invest in the relationships and conflicts that unfold on screen.One of the film's major pitfalls is the wooden delivery of dialogue, with exchanges feeling forced and devoid of natural flow. Emotionally charged scenes that should have been poignant become cringe-inducing, as the actors struggle to convey genuine feelings. It's a painful reminder of the importance of strong performances in bringing characters to life, and ""The Archies"" sorely misses the mark on this front.Even the charismatic Archie Andrews, typically a beacon of charm, is reduced to a lackluster portrayal that lacks the energy and enthusiasm associated with the character.

The_Archies,"The Archies: A Fumbled Debut
The highly anticipated Indian adaptation of the iconic comic strip, ""The Archies,"" sadly fell flat in its Netflix debut. While the premise held promise, the series ultimately delivered a disappointing experience, riddled with weak storytelling and unconvincing performances.A Story Lost in TranslationFrom the very beginning, the narrative lacked direction and purpose. The characters, despite their familiar names, felt shallow and underdeveloped. Their motivations were unclear, their relationships unconvincing, and their dialogue often cringe-inducing in its artificiality. The plot meandered aimlessly, failing to engage the audience or build any genuine tension.Acting Gone AwryThe casting choices, unfortunately, did little to elevate the material. None of the young actors managed to fully inhabit their roles, their performances coming across as awkward and amateurish. They struggled to deliver their lines with even a semblance of naturalism, leaving the characters feeling one-dimensional and uninteresting.A Symphony of DisappointmentWhile the production design offered a vibrant and colorful aesthetic, it failed to mask the fundamental flaws of the series. The musical numbers, a major selling point of the original comic, were poorly choreographed and lacked energy, failing to capture the spirit of the source material.Turning the Page on DisappointmentAfter enduring a mere half-hour of ""The Archies,"" I found myself yearning for the comfort of turning the page. This series represents a missed opportunity to bring a beloved comic to life for a new generation. Instead, it delivered a hollow and forgettable experience that ultimately tarnished the legacy of its source material.A Missed Opportunity""The Archies"" had the potential to be a delightful and engaging series. However, its poor execution, coupled with weak storytelling and unconvincing acting, resulted in a disappointing experience that left me frustrated and unfulfilled. This is a series I would not recommend to anyone, unless they are curious to witness a classic comic strip being thoroughly butchered.","Archies : Fumbled Debut highly anticipated Indian adaptation iconic comic strip , `` Archies , '' sadly fell flat Netflix debut . premise held promise , series ultimately delivered disappointing experience , riddled weak storytelling unconvincing performances.A Story Lost TranslationFrom beginning , narrative lacked direction purpose . characters , despite familiar names , felt shallow underdeveloped . motivations unclear , relationships unconvincing , dialogue often cringe-inducing artificiality . plot meandered aimlessly , failing engage audience build genuine tension.Acting Gone AwryThe casting choices , unfortunately , little elevate material .

The_Archies,"The Archive movie falls disappointingly short of expectations, leaving viewers with a sense of wasted potential. From the outset, the plot appears promising, centering around a mysterious archive with the potential to unlock secrets of the past. However, the execution lacks coherence, and the narrative quickly devolves into a convoluted mess.One of the glaring issues is the pacing, which oscillates between sluggish and frenetic without finding a comfortable middle ground. Critical plot points are either rushed through or dragged out, leaving audiences bewildered and detached from the characters' struggles. It's a missed opportunity to create a suspenseful atmosphere, as the inconsistent pacing undermines any chance of building tension.Character development is another weak point. The protagonists feel one-dimensional, with shallow motivations and poorly explored backstories. Viewers are left with little reason to invest emotionally in their fates, resulting in a lackluster connection to the film's central figures. Even the talented cast can't salvage the wooden dialogue and underdeveloped relationships that hinder the overall viewing experience.The Archive movie's visual effects are surprisingly lackluster, failing to bring the fantastical elements of the plot to life. Rather than enhancing the narrative, the CGI feels forced and artificial, detracting from the immersive quality one would expect from a film of this genre. The production team missed an opportunity to elevate the story through captivating visuals, and the end result is a lackluster spectacle.Adding to the disappointment is the predictable and formulaic nature of the storyline. The Archive movie relies on tired tropes and fails to inject any originality into its narrative. It becomes evident early on that the plot follows a well-worn path, robbing the film of the intrigue and excitement that comes with fresh, innovative storytelling.In conclusion, The Archive movie is a regrettable misfire, failing to capitalize on its intriguing premise. Poor pacing, lackluster character development, uninspiring visual effects, and a formulaic plot contribute to an overall cinematic letdown.

It follows the tired formula of a privileged group trying to understand the struggles of the less fortunate, a trope that has been done to death in countless other films.The direction by Zoya Akhtar is lackluster, failing to bring any excitement or creativity to the screen. The pacing is slow, making the already uninteresting storyline feel even more tedious. It seems that Akhtar's attempts to emulate other successful films fall flat, resulting in a derivative and uninspired work.The performances by the cast are uniformly disappointing. Suhana Khan, in particular, is singled out as a boring and bad actor. Her lack of talent is evident, and it seems that being in LA to study acting has not improved her skills. The other actors fare slightly better but still fall victim to the overall poor quality of the film. The accents and lack of chemistry among the cast further detract from the viewing experience.In conclusion, ""The Archies"" is a wooden, boring, and worst of all, an underwhelming film by Zoya Akhtar.

The_Archies,"The Archies"" (2023) on Netflix is a cinematic catastroph. From its incoherent plot to unrecognizable characters, this film fails on every level. The misguided attempt at humor and a haphazard narrative make for a painful viewing experience.What's truly cringe-worthy is the introduction of a new star cast, primarily consisting of star kids. Their performances are a masterclass in mediocrity, with wooden expressions and lackluster delivery that make you long for the days when acting was an art. The chemistry among the ensemble, if one could generously call it that, is non-existent, resulting in awkward and forced interactions that feel like a painful school play.Cinematographically, the film is a jumbled mess, attempting to blend various styles without any cohesive vision. It's a visual assault that leaves you questioning the director's sanity. The iconic Archies characters are reduced to lifeless caricatures, and the once-charming dynamics among Archie, Betty, Veronica, and Jughead are lost in the sea of incompetence.The soundtrack, featuring The Archies' music, is a feeble attempt to salvage the wreckage. Unfortunately, even the catchy tunes can't distract from the fact that this film is a prime example of how not to adapt beloved characters to the screen.In conclusion, ""The Archies"" (2023) is a cringe-inducing disaster with a cast that epitomizes the worst in new-age star kids. Their performances, coupled with a chaotic plot and abysmal cinematography, make this film a regrettable addition to Netflix's library.

It appears as though the sound emanates from a flat stereo file, depriving the scenes of authenticity and depth. The film attempts a musical, but the execution is painfully lacking.Moreover, the dubbing in the film, tarnishes the viewing experience. The audio sounds artificially produced, betraying any semblance of natural delivery. Indian cinema's persistent mishandling of microphone techniques during dubbing sessions and dialogue mix further magnifies this issue, detracting from the film's potential.Before venturing into complex genres like musicals, perhaps it's time to address fundamental technical aspects for a more immersive cinematic experience.","film 's musical tag misnomer ; music feels disjointed fails cohesively bind narrative together .

The_Archies,"The film ""Archis"" fails to deliver on multiple fronts, leaving viewers with a sense of disappointment and frustration. The storyline lacks coherence, meandering without a clear direction, and the characters are poorly developed, making it challenging for the audience to connect or empathize with them.The screenplay seems to prioritize style over substance, resulting in a visual spectacle that ultimately feels like empty aesthetics. The dialogue is often forced and clichéd, failing to engage the audience or add any depth to the narrative. The pacing is inconsistent, with moments of tedious stagnation followed by rushed and confusing sequences.Furthermore, the performances of the cast, including the lead, come across as uninspired and fail to breathe life into the characters. The film's attempt to convey a meaningful message or theme falls flat, as it lacks a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of its subject matter.In essence, ""Archis"" can be summarized as a disappointing cinematic experience, characterized by a lackluster plot, underdeveloped characters, and an overall absence of the storytelling prowess needed to make a lasting impact on the audience.","film `` Archis '' fails deliver multiple fronts , leaving viewers sense disappointment frustration . storyline lacks coherence , meandering without clear direction , characters poorly developed , making challenging audience connect empathize them.The screenplay seems prioritize style substance , resulting visual spectacle ultimately feels like empty aesthetics . dialogue often forced clichéd , failing engage audience add depth narrative . pacing inconsistent , moments tedious stagnation followed rushed confusing sequences.Furthermore , performances cast , including lead , come across uninspired fail breathe life characters . film 's attempt convey meaningful message theme falls flat , lacks compelling thought-provoking exploration subject matter.In essence , `` Archis '' summarized disappointing cinematic experience , characterized lackluster plot , underdeveloped characters , overall absence storytelling prowess needed make lasting impact audience .","film `` archi '' fail deliv multipl front , leav viewer sens disappoint frustrat . storylin lack coher , meander without clear direct , charact poorli develop , make challeng audienc connect empath them.th screenplay seem priorit style substanc , result visual spectacl ultim feel like empti aesthet . dialogu often forc clichéd , fail engag audienc add depth narr . pace inconsist , moment tediou stagnat follow rush confus sequences.furthermor , perform cast , includ lead , come across uninspir fail breath life charact . film 's attempt convey meaning messag theme fall flat , lack compel thought-provok explor subject matter.in essenc , `` archi '' summar disappoint cinemat experi , character lacklust plot , underdevelop charact , overal absenc storytel prowess need make last impact audienc .",bad,negative,-0.9476
The_Archies,"The narrative, riddled with inconsistencies and lackluster storytelling, fails to engage viewers on any meaningful level. The subpar acting and uninspired direction contribute to a disconcerting viewing experience.

The_Archies,"Hey! These individuals are attempting to replicate a Netflix web series. What a disappointing movie. Seriously! Their acting, direction, and storyline are all fake. It felt like a Myntra advertising shoot. There's no coherent story, just a bunch of inappropriate content and nonsensical, forced acting. I'd like to offer some advice to the cast and director: consider pursuing a different path. Why make cinema worse with this kind of production?

And not in an interesting way like in Barbie. The songs were just incredibly frustrating. It's a real cringe-fest sadly. Might have been good as a Scream type movie which is laughing at itself.

X,"X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at.

X,"I was about to go see Pearl then read that it's based on X in the synopsis so I thought I should view this first. And the fact that a second movie was released so soon after it's first gave me hope. It's not as good as I expected but I don't think it could have been that much better. My concept of horror is a movie that's supposed to scare you and this really doesn't; it's becoming more common for movies to throw in a couple gory scenes and death then labeling it horror. Can't call it a thriller either 'cause it didn't have me at the edge of my seat. The premise is pretty original I'll give it that but it's just not scary. Should be executed better. It's slow paced so it feels like it's building up to something and when it comes it's all over pretty quickly and I never really felt any tension in the life or death scenes. I didn't care for any of the characters either. More effort was put into the adult movie being made than put into actually frightening you.The directors artistic abilities are there, trying to have the same feel as old slasher movies from the 70's. It's pretty forgettable and horror movies shouldn't be, they should make you wanna sleep with the light on. If anything the only reason I'll have trouble sleeping at night is getting the image of two grotesquely old people have sex. When the credits rolled I was trying to recall what made me think this was going to be good.","go see Pearl read 's based X synopsis thought view first . fact second movie released soon 's first gave hope .

X,"After being involved in some great modern horror films such as Hereditary (2018) and Saint Maud (2019), A24's latest film is an immature mess that feels more like an exercise in superfluity than it is a meaningful narrative.Set in 1979, X follows six Americans as they arrive at an isolated farmhouse for a weekend, intent on shooting a porno. Hosted by an unsettling, elderly couple, things soon turn into a full-blown bloodbath.Obviously inspired by Tobe Hooper's classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), writer-director Ti West ensured that X was full of slasher tropes, adding little originality to an already saturated genre. Where it does succeed is creating characters with some personality. Mia Goth's Maxine is noticeably unstable but tries to believe that she is a star. Bobby-Lynne, played well by Brittany Snow, comes across as the more witty, experienced porn actor. Jackson (Kid Cudi) is a Vietnam veteran, while Wayne (Martin Henderson) and RJ (Owen Campbell) provide the overseeing eyes to the pornographic production. Finishing off the cast, Jenny Ortega plays the outsider of the group, Lorraine.Lacking believable or serious motives, the killers in the film were nonetheless unique, providing some creepiness and mystery. However, this soon subsides as we learn their quite ludicrous reasons for their murderous streak. They will certainly not be remembered as iconic horror characters.From the beginning, the film uses themes of religion to juxtapose the vices taking place. The TV in the house shows a programme of a preacher discussing sin, which is repeated throughout the film. As well as this, a well-crafted shot of Lorraine taking off her cross while giving in to the temptation of being involved in the pornographic film hints at what could have been further developed. Unfortunately, the theme is only touched upon within the hour-forty-five runtime, in what seems a missed opportunity to flesh out the barren story.This slasher focuses too much on numerous scenes of nudity in the first half of the film which then mostly moves aside to allow for excessive gore. The extended sex scenes are used in place of well-written dialogue and provide little else than what you would expect. It seems as if Ti West had more of an interest in indulging in some sort of manic sex-gore film than providing any substance to this horror show. And while the gore was well executed with some great effects on display, they are at times over the top and not for the faint of heart.The editing of the film was unique, but rather out of place. Alongside this, X lacked adequate direction, with suspense in short supply and predictability with every kill. The film did not use perspective enough and could have created further tension within scenes by narrowing the viewer's vision and creating a more personal point of view.Without a strong plot, X fails to create a memorable story and instead focuses on showing something more akin to a pornographic film and a gore-fest. The killers were boring and the kills felt formulaic.

X,"Ti West is an incredibly astute visual director, and with X, he continues to show this. He turns this farmhouse into one of the most hellish nightmares imaginable, where there is no place that is truly safe.That being said, West has never impressed me with his writing before. His earlier films have very little detail put into the characters and themes-they're all concept and little substance. Thankfully that's changed with this one. This is probably West's most character-filled film.Every single character in this story is incredibly flawed, yet still retains a shred of sympathetic humanity. The protagonists live too much in the moment with no regard for future consequences, while the film's villains yearn for a bygone era of their lives and harbor envy toward those who have what they have lost. Each group represents an untenable human desire, and it adds a layer of melancholy to the terror that unfolds.It's not a perfect film; like pretty much all slasher films, there are some characters who exist just to get killed off in predictable fashion, and some death scenes come off as rather anticlimactic.Additionally, because every character kind of sucks as a person, there's a two-edged sword in that none of them are particularly likeable and I didn't get attached to them in the way I think West wanted me to.Still, this is quite a wild, effectively uncomfortable ride, and a far smarter one than I was expecting.","Ti West incredibly astute visual director , X , continues show . turns farmhouse one hellish nightmares imaginable , place truly safe.That said , West never impressed writing . earlier films little detail put characters themes-they 're concept little substance .

I can't remember the last time I checked my watch so many times throughout a movie.First hour is an incredibly slow burn of the characters shooting a porn movie, that hour isn't used for character development or anything that is important to the movie. The horror part is the final 45 minutes.Whilst there were a few good kill scenes it didn't save the movie. Paired with some lousy acting which was partly intentional giving the theme of the movie the only good performance coming from Mia Goth.With a muddled twist at the end I came out shaking my head. Not a terrible movie but not one that I'd recommend to my horror movie friends and no doubt I won't remember it in 6 months.I'm guessing the higher reviews are based on artist efforts rather than the story itself and the movie as a whole.

I thought I'd be at the edge of my seat being terrified, and grasping for breath as I waited for what would happen next. Alas, it didn't. It had its moments when things got slightly creepy and I felt uncomfortable. Only a moment or two had me holding my breath until the scene ended, but I was never truly scared. More so just weirded out.The story itself wasn't great, but fit into the context for which it was set. The cinematography was half decent using shadows to hold onto tension. The score helped add onto the tension as well. The acting wasn't fulfilling and didn't give a lot of chemistry.Overall, if I could go back and skip this film I would.

X,"X: A Slasher film which is self referential in much the same as the recent Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre were. Like them it's leavened with a strain of dark humour. It's 1979, six people set off to make an adult movie, the producer Wayne is determined to break into the emerging home video market and make his girlfriend Maxine into a star. The director, RJ, who wants to make an avant garde porn flick is joined by his uneasy girlfriend Lorraine on sound. Bobby and Jackson are two adult film actors. Arriving at the farmhouse location they are met by a crazy old man, Howard, wielding a shotgun, this combined with an old woman, Pearl, eerily staring out a window should have sent the alarm bells ringing. Wayne sweet talks the old man with money. The old geezer is suspicious of them but thinks they're just vacationing in his guesthouse. The filming commences but soon things go awry. This is a mixture of American Gothic, Wrong Turn and Deliverance with extremely violent and downright disturbing moments. One scene in particular features Pearl, slashing away, red lit by car lights, Don't Fear The Reaper playing on the radio is masterly. Indeed the film appears to pay homage to classic slasher films rather than being a pastiche. While the violence is extreme, there seems to be an inevitability to it once Pearl meets Maxine, dreams of her own lost youth and beauty and is jealous. There are a few plot twists, the old couple in particular harbour one or two little secrets. An unintentionally entertaining Fundamentalist Preacher is ranting in the background on TV in many scenes. Mia Goth is great as both Maxine and Pearl, with emerging Scream Queen Jenna Ortega as Lorraine. Written & Directed by Ti West. 8/10.","X : Slasher film self referential much recent Scream Texas Chainsaw Massacre . Like 's leavened strain dark humour .

X,"X caught my eye when the trailer came out. The Texas Chainsaw camera shots and vibe got me curious. Unfortunately, the film didn't live up to the trailer.I'm guessing Ti West was paying homage to Tobe Hooper as there are nods to his work--obviously Texas Chainsaw but also Eaten Alive. There's also a nod to Psycho where the movie takes a hard left halfway through. For me this is where the film goes wrong. The first hour is about the main characters making a skin flick and has more in common with Boogie Nights then anything else. The last 40+ minutes is by the numbers murder in the dark with the characters being killed off in order of importance.The problem for me is none of the component parts of the film go together. The slasher aspect doesn't mesh with the porn film aspect. There isn't a clear theme to the film. The characters aren't particularly likeable so I don't care. Maxine's storyline is poorly defined. The kills lack tension and suspense. There's lots of homage paid to so many films but at the expense of telling it's own story. At the end of the day, there's a lot going on here but none it goes together to tell a tense or entertaining film.","X caught eye trailer came . Texas Chainsaw camera shots vibe got curious .

But it falls woefully short of actually being a good movie in its own right.Its filmed in a nice style, with high class camera work and does a good job recalling the era, with classic 1970s cars and an era appropriate gasoline station, and other nostalgic items present from the 1970s, but after a promising start, the rest of the film takes place in a boring remote rural house setting. This is much more a black comedy than a proper horror movie, and it has zero suspense.The actors try their best, but aren't given anything to work with, with bad dialogue, and no character development. The movie is also very slow paced, and when things do start happening, its too late, and even then, the action is pretty dull and forgettable.It gets points for being a cut above many really bad horror films lately, but it would be a much better use of one's time to actually go watch a classic 1970s horror movie instead.","movie , better standard horror schlock produced Hollywood recent years , least throwback classic 1970s horror era . falls woefully short actually good movie right.Its filmed nice style , high class camera work good job recalling era , classic 1970s cars era appropriate gasoline station , nostalgic items present 1970s , promising start , rest film takes place boring remote rural house setting . much black comedy proper horror movie , zero suspense.The actors try best , n't given anything work , bad dialogue , character development . movie also slow paced , things start happening , late , even , action pretty dull forgettable.It gets points cut many really bad horror films lately , would much better use one 's time actually go watch classic 1970s horror movie instead .","movi , better standard horror schlock produc hollywood recent year , least throwback classic 1970 horror era . fall woefulli short actual good movi right.it film nice style , high class camera work good job recal era , classic 1970 car era appropri gasolin station , nostalg item present 1970 , promis start , rest film take place bore remot rural hous set . much black comedi proper horror movi , zero suspense.th actor tri best , n't given anyth work , bad dialogu , charact develop . movi also slow pace , thing start happen , late , even , action pretti dull forgettable.it get point cut mani realli bad horror film late , would much better use one 's time actual go watch classic 1970 horror movi instead .",good,negative,-0.9454

X,"It's 1979 conservative rural Texas. A group of young people has rented a farm house to film an arthouse porn film. The farm owner does not like the young group. He and his disturbed wife form a creepy couple.Filmmaker Ti West is marrying a softcore porn flick with Texas Chainsaw horror. The porn part is a bit boring although it does arrive at a very interesting conflict. Maybe Ti should get to the conflict sooner and let that ride for awhile. I am a little surprised by goody Brittany Snow playing a sexually-forward porn actress. My brain almost refused to recognize her at first. The horror part is a lot of waiting around. The movie keeps teasing it with the Texas Chainsaw style. It's still pretty good with some great sexual creepiness. On the other hand, I do not appreciate dumb victims.

X,"Taking place in Texas, 1979, where a group of young people (Mia Goth, Jenna Ortega, Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Martin Henderson) plan to shoot an adult film, hoping it'll propel them into stardom. They rent out a property from an elderly couple: Howard (Stephen Ure) and his wife Pearl (Mia Goth), living in an isolated farm and carrying out domineering surveillance. However, the couple eventually catches on to what they're making and the team finds themselves in a vicious fight for their survival. As the day shifts to night, the visitors slowly realize that they are not safe, and are being targeted by a nearby enemy. An X-traordinary Origin Story !. The X-traordinary Origin Story. Dying to Show You a Good Time!. One God Damn Up Horror Picture !.This thrilling and disturbing picture displays mystery, suspense, restless terror including decent scares with tense horror sequences full of gory set pieces. It's a Mia Goth recital in a double role as Maxine / Pearl, including loads of violence, gore, guts and blood. ¨X¨and its prequel ¨Pearl¨ are two nice and twisted terror movies. This ""X"" forms an inseparable diptych with the prequel ""Pearl"", both creating two decent stories that are strongly intertwined, in such a way that one complements the other. Ti West directs this unsettling, colorful film ¨X¨ and the macabre prequel ¨Pearl¨ that got big hit, ¨X¨ was set in1979, in which a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in rural Texas, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast find themselves fighting for their lives; while ¨Pearl¨ was set in WWI, during the Spanish flu, both produced by 'A24', it is the most recient, prolific and influential American studio with films like ¨Hereditary¨, ¨Ex Machina¨, ¨Lady Bird¨or ¨¨Minari¨. In ¨X¨ shows young Maxine/Mia Goth as a teenage girl obsessed with one day becoming a star, however, these aspirations clash with her real life, she also performs an elderly woman and in ¨Pearl¨ set many years ago, in which Mia Goth returns to play the character of Pearl as a teenager, dealing with a deranged girl suffering of loneliness at a farm, whereas she doesn't know which reality is the real one, the actress removes the layers of makeup from the original movie in order to show Pearl's disturbing youth. ¨X¨explored the arrival of the new independent cinema in the seventies, while ¨Pearl¨ set in 1918 (61 years before the story of ""X"") reflecting the style of the golden age of classic cinema, mixing the tone of Douglas Sirk's melodrama with the Technicolor of Mary Poppins in a kind of 'demented' children's film.Director Ti West usually uses focus on the faces and bodies of our protagonists to show the despair and terrible happenings, adding brilliant cinematography by cameraman Eliot Rockett, suspenseful musical score by Tyler Bates and eliptical edition. The film could be described as anything but figurative immersion into the meanderings of the starring's pathological psyche. The motion picture was well directed by Ti West. He is a notorious writer and director known for ""Pearl"" (2022), ""X"" (2022) and ""The Innkeepers"" (2011). And also directed ""Cabin fever 2: The spring fever"" (2009) but after extensive re-editing and re-shooting of by the producers of this film, West requested to have his name removed from the movie and replaced with the popular pseudonym Alan Smithee; since he was not a member of the DGA his request was denied by the producers and he remains credited as the film's director. West has since disowned the final product claiming that it is more a product of the producers and executives than that of his own, it is unknown if there will ever be a ""directors cut"" released featuring West's original vision. ¨X¨rating: 6/10. The flick will appeal terror genre enthusiasts and Mia Goth fans.","Taking place Texas , 1979 , group young people ( Mia Goth , Jenna Ortega , Brittany Snow , Kid Cudi , Martin Henderson ) plan shoot adult film , hoping 'll propel stardom . rent property elderly couple : Howard ( Stephen Ure ) wife Pearl ( Mia Goth ) , living isolated farm carrying domineering surveillance .

X,"Arriving at an isolated farmhouse, the cast and crew of an adult film begin to go about their shoot which alerts the homeowners to their sleazy goings-on and begins to take to graphic means to stop the degenerate filmmakers from doing their film and forces them to try to get away from the farm.There was quite a lot to like with this one. One of the better features here is from the solid background of everyone which gets this going rather nicely. The fine work of the cast and crew of the film, humanizing them with their own dreams and desires that range from the realistic to the full-on dreams that can be achieved at some point with work, sets them up to be a rather likable bunch. That becomes quite fun when added alongside the characterization of the older couple who are given just as much as the film crew which includes some deep touches on sexuality and passion among the elderly that borders on heart-wrenching when initially broached yet turns decidedly sinister as time goes on in the company of the film shoot seeing the enhanced sexuality displayed. This plays a major role in the film's central theme in its demented take on sexuality which proves to be quite fun. As we've already been given quite a lot of input into the wife's mindset by her constant peeping on their activities around the barn and the conversations with her husband, the idea here is firmly established regarding her long-repressed sexual desires needing to be released regardless of her age or physical composition. After seeing that living vicariously through them while they make the film doesn't work, those urges finding a release in the form of a graphic violent outburst is all the more plausible making for a vicious turn off this sexuality-filled premise. The other positive feature here is the aforementioned turn towards the violent and vicious as the third act goes completely off the rails in the best way possible. Not only is the slashing quite enjoyable as it ranges from the graphic surprise encounters that work due to no one expecting them to become confrontational to the inclusion of a crocodile living in the nearby lake that has a solid sequence, and finally working around into a full-on display of sensuality that is just as squirm-inducing as the rest of the material involving the slashing. Filled with some great gore effects and an overall slick sense of style matching the chaos of the situation rather well which makes this one of the finer genre entries overall. There isn't much to dislike here, but it does have some minor flaws. One of the biggest issues is the rather bizarre turn this takes introducing the concept of the couple holding previous victims hostage. This is brought up incredibly late in the film and seems to come about without any build-up and just dropped into the film which tends to highlight the issue of how it would've gone down without being noticed by now. As well, there's also a strange bit involving the strange decision to feature the characters so blatantly unaware of what's happening that they just ignore everything without leaving the location which is entirely unrealistic and keeps them in danger for no reason, which are the issues keeping this one down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Full Nudity, several sex scenes, and drug use.","Arriving isolated farmhouse , cast crew adult film begin go shoot alerts homeowners sleazy goings-on begins take graphic means stop degenerate filmmakers film forces try get away farm.There quite lot like one .

X,"First of all, I couldn't be a bigger fan of The Innkeepers. So, X is horror + 70's porn + Ti West. Qualified as a no-brainer at the time.There were a number of things I couldn't get past in this movie, and I'm assuming they were intentionally done. Every twist, and every kill, has a ""tell"" or a series of tells. It's a device that makes the storyline transparent, and very, very predictable (Ok, there was ONE kill that made me jump). I'm not sure why this decision was made, because it saps every ounce of tension that this movie, frankly, may or may not have had. What a baffling Metascore. Further proof critics wouldn't know a good horror movie if it split their head open with an axe.Plenty of distractions here (not the good kind). The two elderly people are clearly over makeup-ed, to, uh, cover the fact their actually young actors. Hey, the woman even resembles an actress in this film (yes, he put in a ""tell"" for that, too!). How about an intrusive pop soundtrack? God, I hate these. All the best classic horror have original scores. Oh, let's give the chick from Pitch Perfect her own little showcase, too. I mean, give me a break. He goes wide-angle crazy for the first 30 minutes solid, there's an epic crane shot (with a phony backdrop) within the first five minutes (also add pop soundtrack) -- I was assuming he was going for grimy 70's grindhouse. Mission: failed, unless that wasn't his plan at all. I also saw an unnaturally swinging digital weiner.Was The Farmer's Daughters (the porn movie they're making in this film) supposed to be inspired by the 1976 ""roughie"" of the same name? Has Ti West even seen the movie, or is this purely a coincidence? This is another real issue I had. It is these characters' ambition to make a porn film that will not only turn the business on its ear(!), but will make household names of all the cast! The movie they make inside this film is, frankly, completely insipid and boring. I can tell you flat-out there is more plot and characterization in the 1976 sleazefest. The 70's is hands-down the best, most interesting, creative decade for this stuff, and we'll never see it again. West did not even try to capture what was so great about the era. It's just a device (as well as a lurid hook, hey, he got me) for his crappy horror movie.","First , could n't bigger fan Innkeepers . , X horror + 70 's porn + Ti West .

X,"X (2022) ***1/2 Mia Goth, Jenny Ortega, Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Martin Henderson, Owen Campbell, Stephen Ure. Filmmaker Ti West's valentine to '70s horror works its grind house magic with a foreboding tale about a group of friends circa 1979 who embark on a road trip to film a porno and get more than they bargained for while setting up shop on a creepy elderly couple's Texas farm in the middle of nowhere.

X,"It's a trope that slashers have some aspect of sex in them, sure, but the entire first hour of this pos is just the result of a horny director who wanteed to make porn but also wants to pretend they're making a legit movie to their friends. So they filmed bad porn and then tacked 40 mins of slasher on the end.A solid hour of just ""look she STILL has her tits out"" and ""let's have another group discussion about the morals of dating a porn star,"" followed by a kill scene set to the most cliched song to ever be in a kill scene.I get that there's some stupid nonsensical lookalike story going on with a girl and the old woman, but every time she moves in tense moments and a big rubber mask is bending in unnatural ways it pulls you right out of the immersion.The pacing is all over the place. Some scenes just go on for way too long for basically no additional payoff. Like yes, the killer is obviously emotional, but I got that from the first 10 stabs, and the next 20 just had me waiting for it to be over. Some scenes are way too blunt, having a person wander into an area and get killed in about 1 min flat.There's very little imagination in the kill scenes, which may have flown in the decade it's set, but we've had decades of slashers and can expect a bit more these days than someone blatantly holding a knife behind their back stabbing someone.

X,"While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors.","knew film presented slasher film going , better expectations given A24 Studios film .

X,"I have many issues with this film, and I will be addressing them all in bulletin points.The plotThe groundwork that was laid for this film was cool, but it did nothing for anything. This movie revolves around a. Murder scenes b. Sex scenes..... that's it. If there's a story, it has not been told.The character developmentIt is so hard to care about any of these characters with the ways that they are portrayed. I would appreciate it more if it were obvious that the cast were supposed to be grey area characters. But they lack any substance of anything. We are told that the main women want to be stars. But why? Where's the motivation? I want to know why they are there and how they got there. Context can make a world of difference, and there is none. And even at the end, nothing is resolved. Is the character that Mia Goth plays still going to be a drug addict? Sure, she survived, but is she going to live beyond that?The messageThere isn't one. That's all I had to say, let's move on.The climaxOr lack thereof, I should say. Once this movie begins its murder rampage, it doesn't pause but it makes less and less sense. It gets so wrapped up in the ways that the characters have sex and get killed that it leaves no room for any suspense, any details, or character building. I still have no clue what the true climax was and when it was supposed to have started. I guess it is when Mia Goth (who I can't remember her character's name or any of the others' because they spent so little time on it) is in the main house and the rest of the cast members die. But it is so short-lived and creates no satisfaction.ClichésSo many of them. I could guess the way the characters died before it even happened.Where's the twist?I sat this whole movie through, expecting a twist. There's always one in the horror movies these days. I picked through all the details of the film, looked at every picture in their frames, and started guessing and trying to work out how it would end. And then a twist never came. They're just some old, whack-job couple I guess? Weird. Not much motivation for their ways either, other than the old lady's jealousy.-The resolution
Umm... I'm sorry, but the old man randomly having a heart attack in the hallway and dying is the LAZIEST way I have ever seen someone die in a horror/thriller. The script writers were so obsessed with the deaths and gore, but for this guy? Nahhh, that was suddenly too much. Dies silently and peacefully in the hallway of a heart attack. And wow, the old lady dying is almost as lazy. She gets blown back by firing a rifle, which cripples (?) her and she gets her head ran over by Miss Goth.-The whole stupid car keys part
The old lady steals the car keys... only for her to easily tell Mia where there are in the home (not even hidden or ON HER where they would've been the safest from being re-claimed by the group) after she realizes her husband has died. Could've just left that whole plot device out and everything would've been the same in the story. I'm going to also add that it is very flimsy storytelling that this evil old couple a. Died so easily without a fight and b. That the lady told Mia where the keys were JUST because he died. Is she suddenly no longer afraid of going to prison? Or that this girl she wants so badly will escape?TL;DR - This movie focuses so heavily on gore and sex that it loses all capability of telling a story or creating realistic characters.","many issues film , addressing bulletin points.The plotThe groundwork laid film cool , nothing anything . movie revolves around .

Lady_Ballers,"""I never knew myself until now. And nobody knew me until now"".A perfect summary of the frauds that have managed to infiltrate and ruin women's sports. Even though audiences could never compare with men's sports it's still sad because it was about real careers.The movie mocks both the Dylan Mulvaneys and Lia Thomases of today. Absolute nobodies with zero talent that managed to rack up more attention and accolades than they ever deserved.Had this film been made 20 years ago it would barely have been noticed. Nowadays, no doubt it is enough to infuriate entire herds of libs stamping their feet and crying ""transphobia"" all the way to Washington. And that, more than the film itself, will probably be the most enjoyable thing it will offer.A beautiful opportunity for satire, but the writing is poor at times. Some of the dialog is very unnatural and essayist. Like the Munchhausen by proxy line. It's like the writer steps out of the story and inserts opinion journalism.The acting is good mostly. Jeremy Boreing is enjoyable as the frustrated coach and Billy Rae Brandt also shines as the cold and slutty journalist who will do anything or anyone for fame.But the movie is very hit or miss and just doesn't have enough jokes, while it does offer a few good ones. There's a ton of cameo's and small parts of all the Daily Wire pundits. Sadly none of them actually get to be really funny.The ending was weak and the epilogue was not convincing either at the end with Matt Walsh somehow being the mastermind behind the whole scheme.Daily Wire is able to make a film that looks technically good but they really need better scripts.","`` never knew . nobody knew '' .A perfect summary frauds managed infiltrate ruin women 's sports .

Candy_Cane_Lane,Small kids might like this between 3 and 7. Other than that very cheesy. Murphy must have needed the money. Overall story line is just corny and stupid. The miniature talking figurines are just silly and not very well done. The cast is a decent combination. All relatively good actors it's just too bad their talents weren't displayed in a decent imagined plot. The elf is depicted by almost a devil themed character and a sacrilegious remark was openly said. Story jumps all over the place between the plot and a normal family.

Candy_Cane_Lane,"Wow... So Eddie Murphy delivers his second Amazon Movie and his first Christmas themed movie and as a huge Fan of his I can say I'm absolutely disappointed.The movie starts of promising and seems to build up to original ideas, but only goes downhill as soon as the story starts to evolve. Sadly it's a absolute mess and they tried to cram so much into the movie that it's hard to keep track sometimes. The movie lacks depth and characters fight just to reconcile 1 minute later. The movie jumps from scene to scene and every moment of depth conflict or drama is resolved within a max of 3 minutes. There's not one scene that really made me laugh and the movie is so exhausting at times that i really struggled not to turn it off. I don't know what Eddie was thinking but this feels soulless and you can see it on the actors faces and their energy. Everyone seems bored, the dialogue's are hideous and nothing clicks... this is really disappointing and falls in the category of the Eddie Murphy movies that will be forgotten sooner than later.","Wow ...

Candy_Cane_Lane,"I had high hopes for an Eddie Murphy Christmas film but it started out more like a bad rendition of the huxtables where the people walked in and read their script just moments before being on camera. There's some interesting ideas behind the story and the scenery and videography was good but the acting was really bad by the adults, at least, and when they felt the need to insert a very anti-xristian sentence as if in casual dialogue I turned it off. It just blows my mind that people don't seem to understand what Christmas is all about and even have the audacity to imagine that it's just everyone's holiday regardless of their beliefs. But it just is so perplexing why you'd feel the need to actually bash Xristianity in a holiday movie. I do not recommend this film for families and especially not for children. Up until where I left off, the only humor was adult humor and not very good. The only thing I found funny was when they went shopping and they went quickly through first Walmart then Home Depot and then Target because that little skit was on point.

Candy_Cane_Lane,"When Candy Cane Lane isn't being incredibly boring and drawn out with pointless conversations, it is utterly confusing and completely nonsensical in the most miserable way possible. At first it gives the impression that it's a boring talks-a-lot movie, only to then introduce real magic in the form of talking porcelain toys, one of whom spends all his time making one note horribly suggestive comments that are less funny and more groan-some. The entire conflict of the movie hinges on Eddie Murphy refusing to read the fine print on a contract because of his own self centred desire to win 100 grand in a Christmas decoration competition. Later it is revealed that the 100 grand prize is in the form of individual prizes that are collectively valued 100 grand. This pointless twist is then only upturned by the chaos that ensues due to the final confrontation, which only makes you wonder why the twist occurred in the first place. This movie feels like it was written straight ahead with no edits. When the real Santa Claus appears everyone is shocked, but not because they are being shown direct evidence of a being that most of them stopped believing decades ago actually exists, but because he is black. I could tell this was the joke because multiple characters felt the need to say the same thing over and over, which this movie seems to relish in doing for many of its jokes. The movie attempts several times to distract from the main conflict of Eddie Murphy turning into a Christmas toy with side-conflicts, like his son's inability to do math and his daughter's preferred college, which only drains the film of any suspense it may have attempted to create. One of the most horribly written scenes of the movie is when Eddie Murphy, whose character's name is actually Chris, is introducing his family to the toys. As he lists each family off like a roll call, the horribly unfunny Christmas carol choir spout off a song that corresponds to each family members' name, not-so-subtly revealing that each one is named after Christmas. The primary issue with this moment is that any viewer paying only half their attention to the movie would have immediately realised this and wrote it off as stupid, which of course, it is. Not only that, but after each of the songs have been sung, the children all SAY the same observation that the scene just pointed out, as if power drilling this fact into our heads wasn't enough, they had to use a hammer too. The movie is occasionally interrupted by a horribly unfunny news duo who have a one-track dynamic; one is loud and obnoxious, and the other is a straight man, yet neither are an actual dynamic, as it never feels they have any connection at all. Buckle that with the horrible lighting choice and drab set that these scenes use, and it makes for one of the worst parts of the movie. The egg hunt style conflict centres around a search for 5- scratch that, 40 gold rings, representing all of the parts of the 12 days of Christmas, including every time it repeats. The villain, Pepper, who's named after Peppermint because nothing is subtle in this movie, is a mischief maker who deceives to get her way. Instead of intentionally hiding at least one of the rings so the Carvers (who are named after the 1 minute set up at the beginning of the film that shows Eddie Murphy is a wood carver) are guaranteed to fail, instead she just releases all of the rings out onto one street for their convenience. Between drummers drumming, lords a leaping and literal French hens (haha?) the family miraculously collects 33 rings in a span of a 30 minute long 5 minute countdown. The final two rings they need are the ones on their own fingers to make 40, meaning they successfully beat the trial. Except they didn't. The rhyme at the beginning of the movie specifies to ""collect the rings"". This is an important distinction because it is what sets up the twist that there are more than 5 rings. THE rings are the ones that Pepper has released, meaning all of THE rings must be collected. But no, apparently any gold ring counts as long as it's 'in their hands' which apparently includes wearable accessories. Obviously this is a symbol of family, that ultimately Eddie Murphy needed his family to succeed as proven through his own marriage saving him, but unfortunately it is completely misaligned with the logic that the movie presents. I say 'obviously', but without any characters immediately saying this exact sentiment out loud I am tempted to suggest this is just an accidental metaphor. But huzzah, Eddie is saved, but unfortunately the same cannot be said for the other toys that were victims of the same curse. Luckily, and I MEAN luckily, the youngest child decides to make her Christmas wish that the toys have their curses lifted, meaning that they get to- wait WHAT?! So the entire conflict of the movie was completely meaningless? Even the fake out final 2 rings reveal was pointless since all of the bad stuff could have been wished away anyway. This plot point is even more baffling when you realise that it could have easily been avoided had they just made some concession that Pepper's magic would break once she was beaten, rendering her powerless and the toys freed, but no. Could she have wished for Eddie's job back? Or that her older sister gets into college? That her brothers music career kicks off? Her mother gets that promotion? Hell, why not all of it? Why care about any moment in this terrible movie when all of it could have just been wished away? Better yet, why care about anything in this movie when the entire thing from beginning to end is terrible. Horrible pacing, a ridiculous 2 hour run-time, absolutely 0 focus on conflict and more unnecessary, drawn out scenes than a Family Guy episode, this movie deserves not a lick of praise. My one Christmas wish is that I never have to see this horrible movie ever again for as long as I live.","Candy Cane Lane n't incredibly boring drawn pointless conversations , utterly confusing completely nonsensical miserable way possible . first gives impression 's boring talks-a-lot movie , introduce real magic form talking porcelain toys , one spends time making one note horribly suggestive comments less funny groan-some . entire conflict movie hinges Eddie Murphy refusing read fine print contract self centred desire win 100 grand Christmas decoration competition .

The dystopian world Kevin finds himself stuck in challenges him in ways that are very painful to watch.What follows is very thought provoking, as what would you do if you discovered that you're the only one, of yourself, to refuse chaos? What would you do if you were defined by some poor choices in your life that you were found worthy to, again, cause chaos, and not hope?Leaving this film, I was struck by those questions, and pondered them over the last 2 days, as usually my reviews are written faster than this.

The_Shift,"Ok, so I was hoping that this movie was going to be good by the looks of the trailers but I was sorely mistaken. I don't even know where to start. I think the movie was supposed to portray the fight between good and evil but the plot was so dumb that any moral of the story got lost by the confusing theme of the story. And the after the credits were run there was a short message given from the main actor to ask you to go to their website and buy tickets for all your friends to go see the movie. That just screams the modern day church trying to dig their hands deep in your pockets for more money in the name of religion. And I say that as a Christian myself. It's really disgraceful.","Ok , hoping movie going good looks trailers sorely mistaken . n't even know start . think movie supposed portray fight good evil plot dumb moral story got lost confusing theme story . credits run short message given main actor ask go website buy tickets friends go see movie . screams modern day church trying dig hands deep pockets money name religion . say Christian .

The_Shift,"I saw The Shift, starring Kristoffer Polaha-Jurassic World Dominion, Wonder Woman 1984; Neal McDonough-Yellowstone_tv, Captain America: The First Avenger; Sean Astin-Stranger Things_tv, the Lord of the Rings movies and Elizabeth Tabish-The Chosen_tv, Alita: Battle Angel.This is a religious tale that is a little different than the usual kind. You might say it's a Christians meets Sci-Fi drama where the Devil tries to persuade a good person to work for him. Kristoffer meets Elizabeth and falls madly in love with her. After dating a while, they get married and things are fine, until Kristoffer gets in a car wreck. When he wakes up in an alley, Neal is standing over him and helps him up. Neal tells Kristoffer that he shifted Kristoffer to another reality-Neal says there are multiple universes-and wants him to work for him. When asked for his name, Neal says he is goes by lots of names but Kristoffer can call him The Benefactor and that he shifts people all the time. Kristoffer just wants to get back to Elizabeth and doesn't want to work for Neal, which makes Neal send Kristoffer to a different universe. Kristoffer meets Sean on this world and they become friends. Things get a little weird here-even for a sci_fi movie-but I've seen worse. There are watches that can let a person travel between universes and even a movie theater that shows other universes-but only one person at a time can watch. About a minute or two into the end credits, Kristoffer pops up and talks a little about the movie.It's rated PG-13 for violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 55 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be alright to stream.","saw Shift , starring Kristoffer Polaha-Jurassic World Dominion , Wonder Woman 1984 ; Neal McDonough-Yellowstone_tv , Captain America : First Avenger ; Sean Astin-Stranger Things_tv , Lord Rings movies Elizabeth Tabish-The Chosen_tv , Alita : Battle Angel.This religious tale little different usual kind . might say 's Christians meets Sci-Fi drama Devil tries persuade good person work .

The_Shift,"Felt bamboozled by The Shift. I saw this on opening night. I love watching Sci-Fi movies, so I went to see *The Shift*. About 20 minutes in, I began to sense that something was off. Turns out the movie is a multiverse version of *God's Not Dead*, complete with the same lousy plots and acting we have come to expect from Angel Studios. There weren't any overt religious messages in the trailer and advertisements for the film, but the actual film is filled with that stuff. Really felt tricked on this one. No shade to you if you are into religious movies, but be forewarned if that isn't what you want to see.","Felt bamboozled Shift . saw opening night . love watching Sci-Fi movies , went see *The Shift* . 20 minutes , began sense something .

The_Shift,"The actors did an amazing job at presenting the heart of this story. What an awesome retelling of an age old story of trials and tribulations but never losing hope in the face of it all. This movie is a great reminder especially during this holiday season, hope is not wasted. Love wins no matter the outcome, love wins. This story speaks to the masses about how most of us feel, feeling lonely and hopeless. But the truth is we are not alone. So many battle with hopelessness and loneliness it is truly an epidemic, this movie is an awe-inspiring reminder that we are never alone.
